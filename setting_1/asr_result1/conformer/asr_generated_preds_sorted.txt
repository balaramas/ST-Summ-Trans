These breakthrough we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed
There' a lot of great books that we've been written about this
The Al Gore book our choice and the David Machai book "Sustainable Energy Without The Hot Air."
They really go through it and I think it can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this
There' a lot that has to come together
So this is a wish
It' a very concrete wish that we invent this technology
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I can pick whose president I can pick aé which was something I love -- or I could pick that this thing that' half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick
And so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world
This is the one with the greatest impact
If we don't get this wish that a vision between the people who think short-term long-term will be terrible between the US and China between poor countries and rich and most of all the light of those two billion will be far worse
So what do we have to do?
What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?
We needed to go from more research funding
And when countries get together places like Copenhagen they should just discuss the CO2
They should discuss this innovation agenda
You'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches
We do need the market in Senate -- CO2 tag captrayed something that gets that price signal out there
We need to get the message out
We need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the step that the government takes
This is an important wish but it is one I think we can achieve
Thank you Thank you
But as we make a cheaper and let' say let' go for making it twice as cheap we need to mean a new constraint and that constraint has to do with CO2
(Applause)
Thank you Thank you
CA: Thank you I'm going to say more about terror power Right?
CA: I mean first of all can you give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is?
They actually do this software by the supercomputer hire all the great scientists which we've done -- that' only ten of millions
And even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundreds of millions
The tough thing is building the pilot reactor finding the several billion finding the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these
Once you get the first one built if it works as association then it' just clear as day because the economic the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know it
To understand it right this involve building deep into the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium and then the process start at the top and works down
That' right that' right right?
Today you're always refueling the reactors you have lots of people and lots of control that can go wrong -- that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out -- that' not good
So if you have bury
Very cheap fuel then you can put 60 years in just think of it as a log put it down and not have those same complexities
And it just sit there and burn for the 60 years and then it' done
It' a nuclear power plant that is it own waste-depoal solution
Yeah well what happens with the waste you can let it sit there there' a lot less waste under this approach then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that
And we start out actually by taking the waste that exist today that' sitting in these cooling pool or dry caking by reactors that' our fuel to begin with
So the thing that' been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into our and you're reducing the volume of the ways quite dramatically as you're going through this process
The equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one
CA: You're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities
What wear is their most interest in actually doing something with this?
EM: Well we have an picked a particular place but there' all these interesting discloure rules -- anything that' called nuclear
So we've got a lot of interest
People from the company have been in Russia and India China
I've been back seeing the Secretary of Energy here talking about how this fit in the energy agenda
So I'm optimistic
This is a variant on something that has been done
It' an important advance but it' like a fast reactor and a lot of countries have built them so anybody who' not a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the person gets built
CA: So in your mind time-scale and likelihood are actually taking certain like this live
Well we need for one of these high-scale electro-electral generation things that' very cheap we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to Obama
That' sort of the deadline that the environmental and environmental models have shown us that we have to need
And you know terror if things go well which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted that lead to a temperature increase and that temperature increase lead to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirective fact in that the themselves ecosystem can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapse
And there are iPhonely now dozen of companies we need to be hundreds who likewise if their science goes well if they're funding for their plant pilot plants goes well that they can compete for this
And it' baked at multiple phenomenon because then you use a mix of these things
We certainly need one to phenomenon
In terms of big-scale possible game changes there' the biggest that you're aware of out there
Energy breakthrough is the most important thing
It would have been even about the environmental constraint but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater
In the nuclear space there are other renovator
You know we don't know their work as well as we know this one but the modular people -- that' a different approach
There' a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard but maybe they say "I've got us."
And so there are different one but the beauty of this is a molecule Iranian has a million times as much energy as a molecule of say cool
And so if you can deal with the negative which is essentially the radiation the footprint and cost the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is in almost in a class of it own
If this doesn't work then what?
Do we have to start taking 1990 measure to try and keep the temperature of the Earth' stable?
Yet if you get into that situation it' like if you've been overeating and you're about to have a heart attack
Then where do you code?
There is a line of research on what' called geoengineering which are various technique that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together
Now you hope that' just an intrinpaly; you hope you don't need to do that
Some people say you shouldn't even work on the entrance policy because it might make you lay you that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you
I'm not sure that' wise given the importance of the problem but there' now that geoengineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect
Climate intersection if you had a sentence or to you to say to them how might you peruade them that they're on?
EM: Well unfortunately the intersection come in different can
The one who make scientific argument are very few
Are they saying that there' negative feedback effects have to do with cloud that offset things?
They're very very few things that they can even say "There' a chance and a million of those things."
The main problem you have here it' kind of like AIDS that you make the mistake now and you pay for it a lot later
And so when you have all sort of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a game later and a library uncertain painting
In fact the IPCC report -- that' not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the rich world to look at IPCCC and say "OK that isn't that big of deal?"
The fact is it' that uncertain part that should move us towards us
But my dream here is that if you can make it economic and meet the CO2 constraint then the intersection say "OK I don't care that it doesn't put out here too I kind of wish it did put out here too but I guess all except because it' cheaper that right? Well it' come before."
Now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase in CO2 to what temperature will be in where the positive feedback are there' some uncertainty there but not very much
CA: So that would be a response to the view on Lombour argument that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem it' going to take away all your other goal of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth it' a stupid waste of the Earth' resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do
Yet well the actual spending on the R abstractamp;D piece -- say the US should spend 10 billion or more than it is right now -- it' not that dramatic
It shouldn't take away from other things
The thing you get into big money on and this reasonable people can discreet is when you have something that' not economic and you're trying to fund that that to me mostly is waste
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate
In less you're very close and you're just funding the learning curb and it' going to get very cheap I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive
If the trade-off you get into it let' make energy super-inuper-expensive then the rich can afford that
I mean all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle
The disaster is for that two billion
Anyoneboard has changed
His stick now is "Why isn't the R abstractamp;D getting more illustrate?"
He' still because of his earlier stuff sort of associated with the intersection camp but he' realized that' a pretty lonely camp and so he' making the R abstractamp;D point
And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate
The R abstractamp;D piece it' crazy how little it' funded
Well but I somewhat I speak a laugh of most people here to say "I really hope your wish comes true."
And there' certainly and certainly about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
I asked the top scientist in the several times "Do we really have to get down to near zero?"
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?
And the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise
And so that' a big challenge
It' very different than saying you know we're a 12-foot high truck trying to get under a 10-foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under
This is something that has to get to zero
And that might seem a bit surprising because my full-time work at the foundation is mostly abouté and seed about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives
Now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over 26 billion ton
For each American it' about 20 ton
For people in poor countries it' less than one ton
It' an average about five ton for everyone on the planet
And somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero
It' been constantly going up
It' only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero
This equation has four factor a little bit of multiplication
So you've got a thing on the left CO2 that you want to get to zero and that' going to be based on the number of people the services each person using on average the energy on average reached service and the CO2 being put out a per unit of energy
So let' look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero
Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty narrow to cereal
That' back from a high school algebra
But let' take a look
First we've got population
The world today has 68 billion people
That' headed up to about nine billion
Now if we do a really great job on newé healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent
But there we see an increase of about 13
The second factor is the services we use
This encompaes everything -- the food we clothing TV heating
These are very good things
Getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet
And it' a great thing for this number to go up
In the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person
Can we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?
And in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lapse
Now efficiency -- E the energy for each service -- here finally we have some good news
We have something that' not going up
Microsoft various invention and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building building there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite contraryly
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent
There are other services like how we make fertilizer or how we do air transport where the room for improvement are far far less
And so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of six
But for these first three factor now we've gone from 26 billion to it best maybe 13 billion ton and that just won't cut it
So let' look at this fourth factor This is going to be a key one and this is the amount of CO2 put out for each unit of energy
So the question is can you actually get that to zero?
If you burn coal no
If you burn that to a gastroll
Obviously every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewable and nuclear put out CO2
And so we're going to have to do it a global scale is create a new system
So we need energy frequent
Now when I use the term frequent I don't mean something that' impossible
The personal computers are frequent
The Internet and it services are a frequent
So the people here have participated in the creation of many frequent
Uually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the frequent by a certain day
The climate getting worse means that many years their crop won't grow -- there'll be too much rain not enough rain -- things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support
Uually you just kind of stand by and some cut-a-long some don't
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a frequent in a pretty tight timeline
Now I thought how could I really capture this is there some kind of themselves illustration some demontration that would grab people' imagination here?
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquito and somehow people enjoyed that
It really got them involved and the idea of -- there are people who live in mosquito
In energy I like to come up with "I this?"
I decided that releasing fireflie would be my comparison to the environment here this year
So here we have some amplifying
I'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar
Now there' all sort of gimmicky solutions like that one but they don't really add up to much
We need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability
And although there' many direction or people seeking I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers
I've left out tide geothermal fusion
Those may make some comparison and if they can do better then I expect so much the better
But my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting because they all have significant challenges
Let' look first at the burning pulse of fuel either burning coal or burning themselves gas
What you need to do there seems like it might be simple but it' not
And that' to take all the CO2 after you burn it going out the flu pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hold it stay there
Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level
But getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky
And a green arm where these CO2th quantities should be put -- I'll be hard -- but the toughest one here is this long-term issue -- who' going to be sure?
And that lead to sarvation it lead to uncertainty it lead to unret
Who' going to guarantee something that is literally billion of times larger than any type of waste you think I've been in terms of nuclear or other things?
This is a lot of vine
So that' the top one
Next would be nuclear
It also has three big problems: cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing go wrong that even though you have these human operator that the fuel doesn't get used for weapon
And then what do you do with the waste?
Although it' not very large there are a lot of Israel about that
People need to feel good about it
So three very top problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on
So that climate changes will be terrible for them
The last three of the five I've grouped together
These are what people often refer to as the renewable source
And they actually although it' right they don't champion fuel they have some disadvantage
One is that the density of energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant
This is energy farming So you're talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than you think of it normal energy plant
Also these are intermittent source
The sun doesn't shine all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time
Also the price of energies very important to them
And so that you depend on these source you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time period that it' not available
So we've got big cost challenges here
We have MRI challenges for example say this energy source outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from happier
And finally this storage problem
And to dimensionalize this I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phone for flashlight for everything and compare that to the amount of electrical energy the world use
In fact if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy
And what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy
And so in fact we need a big breakthrough here -- something that' going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now
It' not impossible but it' not a very easy thing
Now this shows up when you try to get the Internet and source to be above say 20 to 30 percent of what you're using
If you're counting on it for 100 percent you need an incredible frequent battery
Now how are we going to go forward on this? What' the right approach?
I it a band-handed project? What' the thing that can get us there?
Well we need lots of companies working on this
In each of these five path we need at least 100 people
A lot of them you look in say they're crazy
And I think here in the TED group we have many people who are already puruing this
Now the price of energy has come down over time
Bill Gro has several companies in Cleveland called East Solar that have some great solar thermal technology
The node call us investing in dozen of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and I'm trying to help back that
I need the frequent that I actually are back in a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach
There are some innovation in nuclear modular liquid
Innovation really stopped in this industry quite sometime ago so the idea that there' some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising
Really advanced civilization is based on advance in energy
The idea of a terror power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one percent -- which is the U235 -- we decided well let' burn the 99 percent the U238
It is kind of a crazy idea
In fact people had talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it' through the advent to modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right material' approach this looks like it would work
And because you're burning that 99 percent you have greatly improved cost profile
You actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today' reactors
And so I'm set of worrying about them you just take that it' a great thing
It breed this uranium as it goes along so it' kind of like the candle
You can see it' a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor
The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution and even in the 1900 we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity -- that' why we have refrigerator air-conditioning -- we can make modern materials and do so many things
In terms of fuel this really solve the problem
I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky
This is the left over of the 99 percent where they've taken out the part they burn now so it' called depleted uranium
That would power the US for hundreds of years
And simply by filtering seawater and an inexpensive process you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet
So it' got lots of challenges ahead but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
So let' say how should we measure ourselves?
What should our report card look like?
Well let' go out to where we really need to get and then look at the intermediate
For 2050 you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction
That really is very important that we get there
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries -- still some agriculture -- hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry cement
So to get to that 80 percent the developed countries including countries like China will have had to switch their electricity generation all together
The other greatest: Are we Obamaing this zero-emision technology we Obamaed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it out happier?
That' super important
It' a key element of making that report card
Backing up from there what should the 20-20-report card look like?
Well again it should have the two elements
We should go through these efficiency measure to start getting reduction -- the less we emit the less that sum will be of CO2 and therefore the less the temperature
But in some ways the great we get there doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reduction is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthrough
No prognois can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone' life
And Dr King went on to tell me that he said "In my experience and less repeatedly told otherwise and Avian is given a modern modicum of support if left to their own device a child will achieve."
See Dr King made that shift and thinking
You know so that there' a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
And there' been a shift in my thinking over time and that if you would ask me at 15 years old if I would have traded prosthetic for flesh and bone legs I wouldn't have heitated for a second
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then
If you ask me today I'm not so sure
And it' because of the experience I've had with them not in spite of the experience I've had with them
And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have open door for me than those who have put lid and cash murder on me
So all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and your off
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power the human spirit is so recepted if you can do that in open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
You know I'm of course this is my ragity old Daara so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right?
You're teaching them to open door for natural
In fact the exact meaning of the word "educate" comes in the root word
It means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential
So again which potential do we want to bring out?
There was a case study done in 1960' Britain when they were moving from grandmother schools to comprehensive schools
It' called the streaming trial we call it tracking here in the States
It' separating students from A B CD and so on
And you know the A students get the top or curriculum the best teachers etc
Well they took over a three-month period de-level students gave maize told them they were A' told them they were bright and at the end of this three-month period they were performing at a level
But in fact the quantity was the early 1980 when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids in the world around me
And of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the A students and told them they were dees
And that' what happened at the end of that three-month period
Those who were still around in school beside the drop people had dropped out
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made
They were simply told these are the Astones these are the detutant and that' how they went about teaching them and treating them
So I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit a spirit that' been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty and no longer has our themselves childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
If instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in natural and others to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
When a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
I'd like to leave you with a poem by a 14th-century Perian poet named Hoffice and my friend Jackdom was told me about and the poem is called "The God who only know four words Every child has known God Not the God of name But the God who only know four words and keep repeating them Not the God of name But the god who only know four words and keep repeating them (Laughter) Not the God of name But the God of don't But the God who only know four words (Laughter) Forget (Applause) But the God but the god
And needless to say "Thank God I wasn't using it for SARS back then."
I mean from this entry it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventure my life have precured
So I immediately went to look up the 2009 online addition expecting to find a revision worth noting
Here' the updated version of this entry
Unfortunately it' not much better
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian wired
I find the last two words under near antenance particularly unettling whole and hold some
So it' not just about the words
It' what we believe about people when we name them with these words
It' about the values behind the words and how we can struck those values
Our language affect our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people
In fact many ancient societies including the Greek and the Roman believed that two utter occur verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
So what reality do we want to call into existence a person who was limited or a person who' empowered?
By caually doing something as simple as naming a person a child we might be putting lid and casting murder on their power
Wouldn't we want to open door for them instead?
Once it person who opened door for me was my child' a doctor at the AID Con intitute in Welmington Dellaware
I always keep my Phaar' handy whenever I'm writing anything but I'd already finished editing the piece and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what I'd find
His name is Dr Pete' Otillo an Italian American whose name apparently was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce so he went by Dr Pee
And Dr Pe always were really colorful bothies and had the very perfect disposition to work with children
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital which the exception of my physical therapy session
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetition of exercise with these thick elatic band different color you know to help build up my leg muscle and I hated these band more than anything I hated them had name for them
And oh I was already bargaining at a five-year-old child with Dr Pete trying to get out of doing these exercise I'm successfully of course
And one day he came in to my session contributionive and unforgiving these session and he said to me "Wow I mean you are such a strong powerful little girl I think you're going to break one of those band When you do break it I'm going to give you a hunter box."
Now of course this was a simple ploy on Dr Pea' part to get me to do the exercise I didn't want to do before the propect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor award but what he effectively did for me was rehape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promiing experience for me
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his deploration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
This is an example of how adult and position of power can ignite the power of a child
But in the previous instance of those Baar' entry our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want the possibility of an individual to see natural as capable
Let me read you the entry
Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology
Certainly from medical standpoint my legs -- laser surgery for vision impairment titanium knee and hip replacement for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limit that nature is imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platform -- allows people to self-identified on them not to mention social networking platform it allows people to self-identify not to claim their own disgust of them it allows people to claim their own disgust of them it allows people to claim their own disgust of them it allows people to claim their own disgust
Diabled adjective crippled helpless useless recked stalved maimed lame mutilated run-out weakened impotent catrated paralyzed handicapted paralyzed paralyzed paralyzed paralyzed paralyzed paralyzed paralyzed paralyzed paralyzed handicaped capable
So perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth: that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset
The human ability to adapt it' an interesting thing because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adverity and I'm going to make an admiion this phrase never sat right with me and I always felt uneay trying to answer people' questions about it and I think I'm starting to figure out why
Emplicit in this phrase of overcoming adverity is the idea that success or happiness is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience uncaved or unmarked by the experience as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to side-tep or circum calculatee to preume pit ball of a life with prosthetic or what other people perceive as my disability
But in fact we are changed We are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing
Adverity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to reume living our life
It' part of our life
And I tend to think of it like my murder
Sometimes I see a lot of it sometimes there' very little but it' always with me
Certainly I'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person' struggle
There is adverity and challenge in life and it' all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet it
So our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adverity but preparing them to meet it well
And we do it to service to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
There' an important difference in distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled
And truthfully the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definition
In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognois or indeed a prognoes on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone
Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it serve to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself?
By not treating the wholeness of a person by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever themselves struggle they might have
We are effectively grading someone' worth to our community
So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
And most importantly there' a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
So it' not about devaluing or negating leave more trying time as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adverity
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming -- adverity as it is opening ourselves up to it -- embracing it grappling with it use a wretling term -- maybe even dancing with it
And perhaps if we see adverity as themselves consistent and useful we're less wheelchaired by the presence of it
This year we celebrated the 200 birthday of fabric Darwin and it was 150 years ago when writing about evolution the Darwin descriptiond I think a truth about the human character
To paraphrase it' not the strongest of the species that survive nor is that the most intelligent that survive it is the one that is most adaptable to change
Conflict is the genesis of creation
From Darwin' work among feather we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation
So again transformation adaptation is our greatest human skill
And perhaps until we're tested we don't know what we're made of
Maybe that' what adverity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
So we can give ourselves a gift
We can reimagine adverity as something more than just tough times
Maybe we can see it as change
Adverity is just change that we have and adapted ourselves too yet
I think the greatest adverity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normality
And who' normal?
There' no normal
There' common There' typical There' no normal and would you want to meet that poor badge person if they existed?
CA: Thank so Thank so much Thank so
If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community
Anthropologist tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
There' evidence that Neanderthal 60,000 years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury and perhaps it' because the life experience of survival of these people proved a value to the community
I was reading this look out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so lut a cris but I just gotten past mangled from my voice broke and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the asault from these words unleashed
They didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
A few years ago I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in Northeastern Pennylvania and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes
The summer time I had short on
I hear this guy his voice behind me say "Well if it isn't aiming mom."
And I turn around and this is older man I have no idea who he is
And I said "I'm sorry sorry I don't remember Have we met? I don't remember meeting you."
He said "Well you wouldn't remember mating me I mean when we met I was delivering you from your mother' womb."
So that guy
And of course actually it did click
This man was Dr King a man that I'd only known about through my mother' stories of that day because of course typical fashion I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks
And so my mother' prenatal fortunate had gone in vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
And because I was born we got the scream of Bone and he turned it in and a few toes in this boat and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news
He said to me "I had to give this prognois to your parents that you would never walk and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making a wire out of me ever since."
(Speak Spanish)
It' that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood whether winning a second grade spelling be marching with the girl' gallery ship or any of my sport victories and he was using it integrating it into teaching reident students med students from Honoman medical school medical school medical school people throughout my whole childhood throughout school throughout my whole childhood throughout school throughout my whole childhood throughout school throughout the world
And he called this part of the course the x-factor and it was the potential of a human will
It is very difficult to think straight about well-being and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is
Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
Thank you so much
Now when we were on the phone a few weeks ago you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey
I that something that you can share since you do have a few moment left?
"Show how are you so?"
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Galapago survey is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find
We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self
When you know we looked at how in our feeling very within top
And the third is it' the focusing illusion and it' the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumtance that effects will be without distorting it importance
And it turns out that below an income of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans and that' a very large sample of Americans like 600,000 so it' a large representative sample below an income of 600,000 dollars a year
Thank you Thank you
60,000 60,000? (Laughter) 60,000 60,000 60
Thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappy of the poorer they get
Above that we get an absolutely flat line
I mean I really seem like I'm so flat
Clearly what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buy you misery and we can measure that misery very very clearly
In terms of the other self the remembering self you get a different story
The more money you are the more service for you
That does not hold for emotion
CA: But don't mean the whole American endeavor is about you know lifelimity of the pursuit of happiness
If people took seriously that finding it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about you know for example taxation policy and so forth
I there any chance that politician that the country generally would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it?
You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States no question about that but in the UK it is happening and in other countries it is happening
People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy when of happiness when they think of public policy
I mean this is a real cognitive trap
It' going to take a walk and it' not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life evaluation so we need to have that debate fairly soon
How to rabbi happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing itself
This is going to influence policy I think in the years to come
In the United States effort are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population
There' just no way of getting it right
This is going to be I think within the next decade or two part of national statistic
CA: Well it seems to you that this issue well largely should be the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years
Thank you so much for inventing behavior economic
Thank you very much
Now I'd like to start with an example of somebody with a question an answer session after one of my lecture reported a story and that was the story he said he had been listening to a symphony and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound
And then he added really quite emotionally it ruined the whole experience
Everybody talk about happiness these days
But it happened
When it had ruined what the memory of the experience?
He had had the experience
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music
They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten key
What this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and other people in terms of two cells
There is an experiencing self who lives in the present and know the present capable of reliving the past but basically it has only the present
I had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 and they were many more
It' the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor asked "Does it hurt now when I thought you hear?"
And then there is a remembering self and the remembering self as the one that keep score and maintain the story of our life and it' the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question "How have you been feeling lately?"
Or "How is your trip to our Bennial something like that?"
Those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of a mess about the notion of happiness
Now the remembering self is a storyteller
And that really start with a basic response of all memory it start immediately
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories
Our memory tell our stories that is what we get to keep from our experience is a story
And let me begin with one example
This is an old study
Those are actual patients and they're going a painful procedure
It' no longer painful these days but it was painful when the study was run in the emergency
There has to report on their pain every 60 second
Here are two patients Those are their recording
And you are asked who of them suffered more
And it' a very easy question
The only patient be suffered more East Colonoscopy was longer and every minute of pain that patient A had patient B had and more
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers
But now there is another question: How much did these patients think they suffered?
And here is the surprise
The surprise that patient A had a much worse memory of the Colonoscopy than patient B
The stories of the Colonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the stories how it end
And neither of these stories is very inpiring or great but one of them is this thing but one of them is distinctly worse than the other
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at it speak at the very end it' a bad story
How do we know that?
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total
There is a lot of happiness coaching
And it was much worse for A than for B in memory
Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self
From the point of view of the experiencing self clearly be had a worst time
Now what you could do with patient A and we actually ran clinical experiment and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient aid by just keeping the tubing without drinkling it too much
Everybody would like to make people bathroom
That will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before
And if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient A were soft and you'll made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have endowed patient A with a better story about his experience
What define a story?
And that is true of the stories that memory deliver for us and it' also true of the stories that we make up
But in spread of all this navigat of work there are several cognitive trap that would make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness
What define a story of changes significant moment and ending?
Ending are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated
Now the experiencing self lives it life continuously
It has moment that experience one after the other
And you can ask what happens to these moment?
And the answer is really straightforward: they're lost forever
I mean most of the moment of our life and I chemistryd you know the psychological present is said to be about three second long that means that inner life there are about 600 million of them in a month there are about 600,000 -- most of them don't leave a trace
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self
And yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moment of experience is our life
It' the finite resource that we're spending where we are on this Earth
And how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keep for us
So we have remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive trap
The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time
From the point of view of the experiencing self if you have education and the second week is just as good at the first then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation
That' not the way it works at all for the remembering self
For the remembering self a two-week location is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added
You have not changed the story
And in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing so time has very little impact on the story
This applie to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it a place to scholar thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else'
Now the remembering software' more than we remember and tell stories
It is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two colonoscopies with two different computation and is deciding which of them to choose then the one that has you know the memory that is less bad and that' the computation that will be chosen
The experiencing self has no voice in this choice
We actually don't choose between experience we choose between memories of experience
And even when we think about the future we don't think about future normally as experience
We think of our future as anticipated memories
And basically you can look at this as a tyranny of the remembering self and you can think that the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self-two experience that the experiencing self doesn't need
I had that sense that when we go on vacation this is very miraclely the case that is that we go on vacation to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self
And this is about how to justify I think
I mean how much do we consume our memories?
That is one of the explanation that is given for the dominance of remembering self
And when I think about that I think about a vacation we had an Antarctica a few years ago which was clearly in the vestification I've ever had and I think a bit relatively often relative to how much I think of other vacation
And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip I would say for about 25 minutes in the last four years
The first of these trap are reluctant to admit complexity
Now you know if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it I would have spent another hour
Now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half
This seems to be a discrepancy
Now I may be a bit extreme in how little appetite I have for conuming memories but even if you do more of us there is a participation question: Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put in experience?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment
It turns out that the word "happiness" is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things
Imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get in a music drug so that you won't remember anything
Now would you choose the same vacation and if you would choose a different location there is a conflict between you two cells and you need to think about how to substantial that conflict and it' actually another all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of time then you get one answer because if you think in terms of time you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of time then you think in terms of time then you think in terms of time then you think in terms of time then you think in terms of the time then you think in terms of time you think in terms of time in terms of time then you think in terms of the answer
Why do we pick the vacation we do is a problem that confront us with a choice between the two cells?
Now the two cells bring up to notion of happiness
There are really two concept of happiness that we can apply one percent
So you can ask how happy is the experiencing self
And then you would ask how happy of the moment in the experiencing self' life
And there are happiness for moment as a fairly complicated process
What are the emotions that can be measured?
And by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it' a completely different thing
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that will have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is
This is not about how happy a person lives
It is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person think about her life
Very different notion
Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notion is going to mess up the study of happiness and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being who have been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way
The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognizing recent years and there are now effort to measure the two separately
The Gallup Organization has a world poll with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experience and there have been other effort along those lines
So in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells
And the main lesson I think that we have learned is that they're really different
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life and vice versa
Just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is about 5
What that means is if you met somebody and you were told or his father is six feet tall how much would you know about his height?
Well you would know something about this height but there' a lot of uncertainty
You have that much uncertainty
If I tell you that somebody rank their life eight on a scale of 10 you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self
So the correlation is low
We know something about what control satisfaction of the happiness self
We know that money is very important goal are very important
We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like spending time with people that we like
There are other pleasure but this is dominant
The second trap is a confuion between experience and memory basically it' between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two cells you are going to end up doing very different things
The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a subtitute for well-being
It is a completely different notion
Now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life and we actually live
So if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California you are not going to get to the correct answer
When you ask that question you think people must be bathroom in California if say you live in Ohio
(Applause)
And what happens is when you think about living in California you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places and that contrast says in climate
Well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that decide how happy people are
But now because the reflective self is in charge you may end up some people may end up moving to California
And it' sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California and the hope of getting bathroom
Well their experiencing self is not going to get bathroom
We know that
But one thing will happen They will think they are bathroom because when they think about it they'll be reminded of how suspect the weather was in Ohio and they will feel they made the right decision
And those are two very different concept and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness
It' all here It' all in the web
You can go back to your room and try this after my talk
With pivot you can drill into a decade
You can drill into a particular year
You can just break into a specific issue
So I'm looking at this I see the athlete that have appeared in this issue the sport
I'm a Lance Armtrong fan so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that which reveal for me all the issues in which Lancer and Strong' been a part of
(Speak Spanish)
Now if I want to just take a peak of these I might think well what about taking a look at all of cycling?
So I can step back and expand on that
They see Greg Gamma now
And so you get the idea that when you calculatee over information this way going narrow broader backing and backing out you're not searching you're not browing
You're doing something that' actually a little bit different
It' in between And we think it changes the way information can be used
So I want to extrapolate on this idea but with something that' a little bit crazy
If like I leave you with one big idea today it' that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about information overload what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information to that patterns pop and we can see trend that would otherwise be invisible
What we've done here is we've taken every single knock page and we're reduced it down to a little summary
So the summary consist of just little subnopes and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from
I'm only showing the top 500 most popular knock page right here
But even in this limited view we can do a lot of things
Right away we get a sense of what are the topical domain that are most popular in knock
I'm going to go ahead and select government
Now having selected government I can now see that the knock February that most miraclely glacier to that are time magazine people of the year
So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one knock page
It' only possible to see that insight when you step back it look at all of them
Looking at one of these particular summaries I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them
So looking at these people I can see that the majority come from government some I've come from themselves science -- some you or still have come from business there' my bo and one has come from music
And interestingly enough Bono is also TED Prize winner
So we can go jump and take a look at all TED Prize winner
So you see we're calculateing the web for the first time as if it' actually a web not from page to page but at a higher level of&ion
And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise
I'm just showing the New York Times website here
So pivot this application I don't want to call the brower it' really not a brower but you can view web page with it and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like that
So I can step back pop right back into a specific section
Now the reason why this is important is because by virtue of just viewing web page in this way I can look at in my entire browing history in the exact same way
So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frame
Here in fact is the state of all the demo that I just gave
And I can sort of replace some stuff that I was looking at earlier today
And if I want to step back and look at everything I can slice and dice my history perhaps by my search history here I was doing some methetistic searching looking for being over here for livelap pivot
And from these I can drill into the webca and just launch them again
It' one metaphor repurpose multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data
So right now in this world we think about data as being this curse
We talk about the curse of information overload
We talk about drowning and data
What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down so that instead of calculateing from one thing to the neck we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden?
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age
If we can do that then instead of being trapped and data we might actually extract information
And instead of dealing just with information we can tease out knowledge
And we get the knowledge that there may be these room there' wisdom to be found
So with that I thank you
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment
It' called pivot and with pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter on one particular cause of death say accident
And right away I see there' a different pattern that emerge
This is because in the mid-air here people are they most active and over here they're most frail
We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death seeing that circulatory disease and cancer are the usual somewhat but not for everyone
If we go ahead and we filter by age say 40 years or less we see that accident are actually the greatest call that people have to be worried about
And if you draw them to that it' especially the case for men
So you get the idea that viewing information doing data in this way is a lot like swimming and in living information and photographic
And if we can do this for raw data why not do it for content as well?
So what we have right here is the cover of every single sport descriptiond ever produced
And I found that because there weren't video games in this saturation of CG movie and all of this imagery in the media landscape I had to create these images of my head
You know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the office disgust put something on the screen the movie screen in our head
And so my response to this was to paint to draw alien creature alien world robots spaceship all that stuff
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook
That was -- creativity had to find it outlet somehow
And an interesting thing happened that the Jacque Cousteau shows -- actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday -- that seemed pretty darn on likely
But that was a world I could really go to right here on Earth that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books
So I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 50
I grew up on steady diet of side section
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada -- 600 miles from the nearest ocean
But I didn't let that dawn me
I pastured my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo New York right across the border from where we live
And I actually got certified inner pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo New York
And I didn't see the ocean real ocean for another two years until we moved to California
In high school I took a bus to school an hour each way every day
Since then in the intervening 40 years I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater and 500 hours of that was in submerible
And I've learned that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow ocean are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination
Nature' imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination
I still to this day stand an absolute awe of what I see when I make these dive
And my love affair with the ocean is on going and just as strong as it ever was
But when I chose career as an adult it was filmmaking
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urge to create image
And I was always absorbed in a book science fiction book which took my mind to other world and satisfied this in a narrative form this inatiable sense of curiosity that I had and ...
And I was as a kid constantly drawn comic push and so on
So filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together and that made sense
Of course the stories that I chose to tell were side fiction stories terminator alien then the aby
And with the aby I was putting together my love of underwater and tidying with filmmaking
So merging the two passion
Something interesting came out of the aby which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature -- we actually embraced computer-generated animation
And this resulted in the first soft-urface character CG animation that was ever in a movie
And even though a film didn't make any money bear and broke even I should say I went to something amazing which is that the audience the global audience was memerized by this apparent magic
You know it' Arthur Clarke' Law and any  advocately advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
They were seeing something magical
And so that got me very excited
And I thought "Wow this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art."
So with Terminator 2 which was my next film we took that much farther
Working with ILM we created the liquid metal dude in that film and that success song in the balance on whether that effect would work
And it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we did make a little more money on that way
So you know dry aligned through those two dot of experience came to -- this is going to be a whole new world -- this is a whole new world of creativity for film artist
So I started a company with Stam Winton my good friend' Dam Winton who was the premure makeup in creature designer at that time and it was called digital domain
And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the kind of analog processes of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production
We actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while
But we found ourselves lagging in the midnight in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do
And that curiosity also manifested itself and in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the wood hiking and taking sample frog and snake and bug and pond water and bring it back looking at it under the microscope
So I wrote this piece called Avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects of CG effects beyond with realistic human emotive character generated in CEG and the main character at all BMCG and the world would be in CG
And the Emmalo pushed back and I was told by folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while
So I shoved it and I made this other movie about a big ship that sink
You know I went and pitched to the studio as Romeo and Juliet on a ship it' going to be this epic romance passionate film
Secretly what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of Titanic
And that' why I made the move
(Applause)
And that' the truth Now the studio didn't know that
But I convinced that I said "We're going to dive to the wreck We're going to film it for real We'll be using it in the opening of the film It'll be really important to be a great marketing hook."
And I talk them into funding and magnitude
Sound crazy but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality
There' actually created a reality where at six months later I find myself in a Russian submerible two and a half miles down in the North Atlantic looking at the real Titanic through a viewpoint
Not a movie not HD4 real
Now that blew my mind
And you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build camera and light and all kinds of things
But it struck me how much this dye of these deep dyes was like a space mission
You know where it was highly technical and it required an enormous planning
You get in this capule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there' no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself
And you know I thought "Well I'm like living in a science fiction movie This is really cool."
And so I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration
Of course the curiosity the science component of it -- it was everything -- it was adventure it was curiosity it was imagination
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me
Because you know I can imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window
As we did some of our subsequent magnitude I was seeing creature at hydrothermal vent and sometimes things that I had never seen before -- sometimes things that no one had seen before -- sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image them
So I was completely smitten by this and had to do more
And so I actually made a chronic curious decision
After the success of Titanic I said "OK you know I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood moviemaker and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while."
And so we started planning these magnitude
I was you know I was real science heat
And we ended up going to the Bizmark and exploring it with robotic vehicle
We went back to the Titanic record
We took little dot that we had created that' school to fiber optic
And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship which had never been done
But it was all about trying to understand understand the world understand the limit of possibility
Nobody had ever looked inside the record and didn't have the means to do it so we created technology to do it
So here I am now on the deck of Titanic sitting in a submerible and looking out at plank that look much like this where I knew that the band had played
And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the quarter of the ship
When I say I'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle
I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic
And it was the most surreal kind of dazure view experience I've ever had because I would know before I turned to corner what was going to be there before the light of the vehicle actually revealed it because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie
And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprint of the ship
So there was this absolutely remarkable experience
And it really made me realize that you know tell the telepreence experience that you actually can have these robotic avatar then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle into this other form of existence
It was really quite profound
And my love of science fiction actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening -- this was in the late '60 -- we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep ocean
And maybe a little bit of a glimpse took to what might be happening you know some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human future that I can imagine as a science fiction fan
So having done these magnitude and really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as the deep ocean vent where we had these amazing amazing animals basically alien right here on Earth
They live in an environment of chemosyntheis
They don't survive on sunlight-based system the way we do
And so you're seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree set of grade water plumes
They think they can't possibly exist
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well again you know it' the science fiction influence as a kid
And I wound up getting involved with the space community really involved with NASA sitting on the NASA adviory board planning actual space mission going to Russia going through the precaustment biomedical protocol and all these sort of things to actually go and fly to the abandon Space Station with our 3D camera systems
And this was fascinating
But what I ended up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep
And taking them down so that they had access astrobiologist planetary scientists people who were interested in these extremophile environment taking them down to the events and letting them see and take sample and test instrument and so on
So here we were making documentary film but actually doing science and actually doing space-ized
I completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan as a kid and doing this stuff for real
And you know along the way in this journey of discovery I learned a lot
I learned a lot about science but I also learned a lot about leadership
Now you think director got to be a leader later you know captain the ship all that sort of thing
I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these magnitude
Because at a certain point say "What am I doing out here? Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"
We don't make money at these dam shows
We barely break even There' no fame in it
People sort of think I went away between Titanic and avatar and was buffing my nail someplace sitting at the beach
Jacque Cousteau was coming into our living room with his amazing special that showed us animals and places in a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined
Made all these film made all these documentary film that you know for a very limited audience
No fame no glory no money What are you doing?
You're doing it for the task itself for the challenge and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly net team
Because we would do these things with 10 12 people working for years at a time sometimes at sea for two three months at a time
And in that bond you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else
When you come back to the shore and you say "We had to do this and the fiber optic and the attenuation and that' all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspect of working at sea If you can't explain it to people it' that thing that maybe cop have or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they could never explain it."
Create a bond create a bond of respect
So when I came back to make my next movie which was avatar I tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return
And it really changed the dynamic
So here I was again with a small team and you know an uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didn't exist before
Tremendously exciting
Tremendously challenging
And we became a family over a four-and-a-half-year period
And it completely changed how I do movie
So that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it
So people have commented on how you know you brought back the ocean organism and put them on the planet of Handora
To me it was more a fundamental way of doing business the process itself the change as a result of that
So what can we asleep out of all this?
You know what are the lesson learned?
Well I think number one is curiosity
It' the most powerful thing you own
Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality
And the respect of your team is more important than all the law in the world
And I have young filmmaker come up to me and say "You know give me some advice for doing this."
And I say "Don't put limitations on yourself Other people will do that for you Don't do it to yourself Don't but against yourself and take risk."
And I was an artist
NASA has this phrase that they like: "Fellower is not an option."
But failure has to be an option in art and an exploration because it' a leap of faith
I could drive a painter
And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk
You have to be willing to take those risk
So that' the thought I would leave you with is that in whatever you're doing failure is an option but fear is not Thank you
That' not a business and it is agriculture
Our breadbaket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
Not by the latest combined and tractor and invention but by fertile land not by pump but by fresh water not by chainaw but by forest and not by fishing boat and net but by fishing the sea
So for better for worse aquaculture fish farming to do a part of our future
One of you in the world one of you the world one of you the world one of you the world
Let' start by asking "How am I going to feed ourselves?"
Or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself?
To do that don't look at the Agribues model for the future
It' really old and it' tired
It' high on capital flood and machines and it' never produced anything really good deep
Instead let' look to the ecological model
A lot of argument against it: fish farm pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they're inefficient take tuna major drawback
That' the one that relie on two billion years of on the job experience
Look to me go! Farmer like me go!
Farm that aren't world and to natural farm that restore instead of deplete farm that farm extensively instead of just intensively farmers that are not just producers but expert and relationships
Because they're the one that are expert in flavor too
And if I'm going to be really honest they're a better chef than I'll ever be
You know I'm okay with that because if that' the future of good food it' going to be satisfy
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
It' got a feed convergent ratio of 15 to one
That means it takes 15 pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna
Not very sustainable
Then thank very good either
So here finally was a company trying to do it right
I wanted to support them
The day before the event I called the head of PR for the company
Let' call him Dun
Down I said just to get the fact straight you guys are famous for farming so far out to see you don't pollute
That' right he said "We're so far out The waste from our fish gets distributed not concentrated."
So I've known a lot of fish in my life
And then he added or basically a world done to ourselves -- at fete convergent ratio -- 25 to one he said
Best in the business
One if I go in great way why do I go in great way?
Like two point I'd like what? What do you feed?
Sutainable protein he said
Great I said "Got off the phone."
And that night I was lying in bed and I thought what the hell is a sustainable protein?
(Applause)
So next day just before the event I called Down
I said "No what are some example of sustainable protein?"
He said "Even no they would ask around."
I've loved only two
While I got on the fall of a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally I got on the phone with the head biologist
Let' call him down too
(Applause)
John I said "What are some example of sustainable protein?"
Well he mentioned analogies and some fish meal and then he said "Chicken pellets."
It was a chicken pot It was a chicken pot
He said "Yeah feather can bone meal scratch dried and processed into feed."
At first one was -- it was more like a passionate affair
He said "What percentage of your feed is chicken?"
Thanking you know two percent
"Aw that' about 30 percent," he said
I said "God what' sustainable about feeding chicken fish?"
(Applause)
There is a long pause on the line and he said "There' just too much chicken in the world."
I fell out of love with this fish
(Applause)
Now not because some self-right is going to choose Foody
It was a beautiful fish a flavorful textured media a best salar on the menu
Actually I'm plea actually I'm partly I'm partly I'm partly am
Now I felt out of love with this fish because I sort of got it after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken
This second fish -- (Laughter) -- that' a different kind of love story
It' the romantic kind (Laughter) The kind where the more you get to know your fish we love the fish
I first ate it at a restaurant in Southern Spain
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time
She kind of set us up
(Applause)
It came to the table a bright almost shimmering light color
The chef had over-cooked it
Like twice so I twice soap
Amazingly it was still satisfy
Who can make a fish taste good after it' been over-cooked?
I can but this guy can't
Let' call him Miguel Actually his name is Miguel
(Applause)
And now he didn't cook the fish and he' not a shaft at least in the way that you and I understand it
What if this?
He' a biologist at Ventala Pamma
It' a fish farm in the Southwestern corner of Spain
It' at the tip of the Guadalla Caviar river
Until the 1980 the farm was in the hands of the Argentinian
They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetland
They did it by draining the land
They built this intricate series of canal and they pushed water off the land and out into the river
Well I couldn't make it work out economically
And ecologically it was contributioned
It killed like 90 percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds
Even better it was farmray to the supposed highest standard of sustainability
And so in 1982 a Spanish company with an environmental concience compellingd the land
What did they do?
They reversed the flow of water
They literally flip the switch
Instead of pushing water out they use the channel to pull water back in
They navigated the canal
They created a 27,000-acre fish farm Ba Mulit shrimp eel any in the process Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction
The farm incredible
I mean you've never seen anything like that
You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are navigated canal and this thick rich marshland
I was there not long ago with me go
He' an amazing guy like three parts fabric Darwin and one part crocodile dungb
OK There we are slowing through the wetland and I'm panting and sweating I'm not up to my knee and we go as commonly conducting a biology lecture
Here he' pointing out a rare black shoulder kite
Now he' mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton
So you can feel good about selling it
And here here he see a grouping pattern that remind him of the Tanzanian giraffe
It turns out Miguel spent the better part of his career in the McUmie National Park in Africa
I asked them how it became such an expert on fish
He said "Fish I'm not annoying thing about fish I'm an expert in relationships."
And then he' off launching into more talk about rare birds and algae and strange aquatic plants
And they'll get me wrong I was really fascinated you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing
It' great but I was in love
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months
And my head was sooning over that over-cooked piece of satisfy fish I had the night before
So I interacted with him I said "My god what makes your fish taste so good?"
We point at the algae
I know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships it' amazing Right? But what are your fish eating? What' the feed converion ratio?
When he goes on to tell me it' such a rich system that the fish are eating what they're eating in the wild
The plant bioma the fight-up line the zooplank and it' what feed the fish
The system is so healthy it' totally self-renewing
There is no feed
Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed it animals
Later that day I was driving around this property with me gal and I asked them I said "For place it seems so themselves unlike any fish for alligate farm I'd ever been at How do you measure success?"
One day the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak out an event about the farm sustainability
At that moment it' as if a film director called "For a Sex Change."
And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing site -- thousands and thousands of pink flamingos -- a literal pink car fit for as far as you could see
That' success he said
Look at their bellies Pink They're feasting
Kee' thing It' totally confused
I said "Well aren't they feasting on your fish?"
"Yes," he said
Thank you
We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish egg to birds -- I will last year -- this property had 600,000 birds on it -- more than 250 different species -- it' become today the largest and one of the most important -- private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe
Abolutely I said "Abolutely," I said
I said "Maybell isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm?"
(Applause)
He sugar that nose
He said "We farm extensively Not intensively The flamingos eat the shrimp The shrimp beat the phytoplankton So the pink of the belly the better the system."
Here' a company trying to solve what' become this unimaginable problem for our ches: How do we keep fish on our menus?
Okay so let' review A farm that doesn't feed it animals and a farm that measure it success on the health of it predator
A fish farm but also a bird sanctuary
Oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place
They brewed in a town 150 miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nest
Every morning they fly 150 miles into the farm
And every evening they fly 150 miles back
(Applause)
They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway
No kidding no kidding no kidding
I was terribly a march of the penguin' thing so I looked at me go
I said "My gal do they fly 150 miles through the farm and then do they fly 150 miles back at night? Do they do that for the children?"
He looked at me like I just quoted a Whitney used and so on
He said "No they do it because the food' better."
(Applause)
I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was satisfy and I don't like fish skin -- I don't like it seared I don't like it crispy
It' that accurate tar-like flavor
For the past 50 years we've been fishing the sea like we clear cut forest
I must never cook with it
Yet when I tasted it at that restaurant in Southern Spain it tasted not at all like this skin
It tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean
I mention that to me gality not a day
He said "The skin egg like a sponge It' the last defense before anything enter the body It evolved to soak up impurities."
And then he added but our water has no imperities
OK a farm that doesn't feed it fish a farm that measure it success by the success of it predator
And then I realized what he says a farm that has no imperities he made a big underavement because the water that flow through that farm comes in from the Guadult of your river
So river that carries with it all the things that river tend to carry these days -- chemical contaminant peticide run off
And when it works it way through the system and leave the water it' cleaner than when it enter
The system is so healthy it purifies the water
So not just a farm that doesn't feed it animals not just a farm that measure the health that it' success by the health of it predator but a farm that' literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well
It' hard to overstate the destruction
Because when that water leave it dump out into the Atlantic
A drop in the ocean I know but I'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive
You might say it' a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about ba or beef cattle
What we mean now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually taste good
(Applause)
For a lot of people that' a bit too radical
We're not realists us food is we're lovers
Ninety percent of large fish the one we love the tuna the halibate the salmon the swordfish the clap
We love farmers' market We love small family farm We talk about local food We eat organic
And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food someone somewhere stand up and says "Hey I love think flamingos How are you going to feed the world?"
How are you going to feed the world?
Can I be honest?
I don't love that question
No not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world
One billion people will go hungry today
One billion that' more than ever before because of growth inequalities in distribution not punish
Now I don't love this question because it' determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years
Feed-grained herbivore -- peticide to monoculture chemical to soil chicken to fish -- and all along agribuiness has simply asked "If for feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be?"
There was nothing left
That' been the motivation -- it' been the justification -- it' been the business plant of American agriculture
We should call what it is: a business in liquidation a business that' quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible
And the object of this is quite simple
I'm going to open my hand and hopefully I fall as well my pure animal magnetism will hold the maximum
In fact it' held so tightly in place that I can shake it and the maximum does not come off
Nothing goes up or down my sleeve you know trickery and you can examine everything
"Could it?"
(Applause)
So this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very simple trick methodologically
Probably many of you in the room know this trick
What happens is this
I told the maximum in my hand
I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve That is a lie
The reason I'm holding on to my wrist is because that' actually the secret of the illusion
In a moment when my hand move from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index finger just going to shift from where it is to a position running out like this
Nice one
Someone who didn't have a child herd is out there
(Applause)
So it goes like this from here right?
For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that I do which is something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real
And as I move around my finger shift
So we could talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three finger down here because the mind and the way it processes information it doesn't count one to three groups of them
But that' not really what this is about right then I open my hand
coordinate it' cleaning there not by animal magnetism but by chokingry in next finger being there
And then when I close my finger the same thing as I move back the motion kind of cover the will be back my finger
I take this hand away you give the maximum out
There' a trick you can do for your friends and neighbor you know thank
Now what does that have to do with the placebo effect?
I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind-wide open
I'm not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an facility thing
It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that' like aspirin-haped just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect
But if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective
Even though neither one of these things has any 2011 -- they're sugar pill
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill
What? That really flipped me out
Turn out though that' not even where it stop
If you have capules they're more effective than tablet in any form
A colored capule that' yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capule
Doage has something to do with this
Pilot twice a day is not as good as three pill -- I don't remember the statistic nut
But the point is the point is -- the point is --
These doage have something to do with it
And the form has something else
And if you want the ultimate in placebo you go to the needle
Right? A syringe with some inner a couple of sea of some inert something and you inject this into a patient
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind that it' so much stronger than the white pill
It' really this graph well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slide
The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capule as not as good as the needle
And none of it has any real 2011 quality; it' only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick
And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real
And we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle
This is a seven-inch hacking it' very very sharp and I'm going to just sterilize at a tiny bit
In other words sugar pill have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies -- the placebo effect -- just because the person think that what' happening to them is a 2011 effect just because the person think that what' happening to them is a 2011 for pain management for example if they believe it enough there' a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect in the placebo effect in the body called the placebo effect in the placebo effect
This is really my flesh This is not Damian' special grown flesh
That' my skin right there This is not a Hollywood special effect
I'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side
If you're quizy if you faint easily I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night some people that I didn't know and one woman almost passed out
So I suggest if you get crazy easy that look a wave for about the next 30 you know I'll do the first bad part behind it
You'll get to see you can look away too if you'd like to
So here' what happens Right here at the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make little peer
I'm sorry man about my freaking you out
OK and then just through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this
Now essentially we're in the same position we were in with the maximum trick
Sort sort of a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort
But you can't count my finger right now Kenya
So let me show you that' one two three four five
You know that' what we're doing
I know what people think when they see this thing
They go well he was certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes so let me give you a little peak As that looked out there pretty good
Yeah I don't At the people in the back go "public I didn't really see it."
People in satellite room are like starting to move in now
I'm going to give you a good close look at this
That really is my skin that is not a Hollywood special effect
That' my flesh and I can twist that around
I'm sorry I don't -- if you're getting quizy look away Don't look up the thing
People in the back are people on video years from now watching this ago "Well yeah that looks kind of neat and some sort of effect there." (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause)
Now I would take the needle out of it
I would clean up my arm and I would show you that there are no wound
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real I'm just going to leave it there and walk off the stage
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days
I hope you're looking forward to that Thank you very much
Something fake becomes something real because of someone' perception of it
In order for us to understand each other I want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick
And I'm going to show you how it works -- this is a trick that' been in every children' magic book since at least the 1950
I learned it myself from Cup Scot Magic in the 1970
I'll do it for you and then I'll explain it
And then I'll explain why I explained it
So here' what happens
Life which you could examine me in life which you could examine me
It was going to hold the maximum in my fists like this
I get my sleeve back
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here
That way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as I'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleep
And then we ask you to blog about it to post video to post photo
We piloted this game with 1700 players in 2007 and we've tracked them for the three years since
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience
Here' why
Nobody want to change how they live just because it' good for the world or because we're supposed to
But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them "We've run out of oil This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on Challen yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habit that they learn in this game."
This picture pretty much sum up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species
So for the next world-aving game we decided to aim higher -- bigger problem than just peak oil
We did a game called Supertock to the Institute for the future
And the premise was a supercomputer has chemistryd that humans have only 23 years left on the planet
The supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system of course
And we ask people to come online almost like a Jerry Brookheimer movie
You know to hear about camera movie you form a dream team you've got the ashnot the scientists the X convict and they all have something to do to save the world
But in our game instead of just having five people on the dream team we said "Everybodies on the dream team and it' your job to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net."
We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks
They came up with 500 inanely creative solutions that you can go online if you Google Supertockmen see
So finally the last game we're launching at March 3
This is a game done with the World Bank Institute
Truly This is a portrait by a photographer named Sil Toldana
If you complete the game you will be certified by the World Bank intitute as a social innovator class of 2010
Working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills
We've got a graphic novel we've got leveling up in skills like local insight knowledge networking sustainability vision and resourcefulness
I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing areas who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprise to save the world
You wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so we set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing
So I'm going to wrap up now
I want to ask a question
What do you think happens next?
We've got all these amazing gamers we've got these games that are kind of pilot of what we might do but none of them have saved the real world yet
Well I hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real-world work that games are powerful platform for change
We have all these amazing superpower bliful productivity the ability to weave a tight social intervention this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning
I really hope that we can come together to play games at matter to survive on this planet for another century
That' my hope that you'll join me and making and playing games like this
When I look forward to the next decade I know two things for sure that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want so I say let the world-changing games begin
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
And this is a classic gaming emotion
(Applause)
Now if you're not a gamer you might mis some of the nuance in this photo
You probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of fear but intense concentration deep-deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem
If you are a gamer you will notice a few nuance here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrow up is surprised
This is a gamer who' on the verge of something called an epic win
I'm thinking "Well I'm a game designer."
(Applause)
You heard of that
OK good So we have some gigver among us
An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it
It was almost beyond the terrifying of imagination and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of
And making games online now for 10 years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacle of the next century the face of someone who against all odd is on the verge of an epic wind
Now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems
This is what I call the "I'm not good at Life Face."
And it' actually me making it
Surely me making -- I'm not good at life-face
This is a piece of graffiti in myel neighborhood in Berkeley California where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have
We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games
I don't mean just good as in successful although that' part of it
We do achieve more in game world
But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matter inspired to collaborate and to cooperate
And when we're in game world I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment' notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again
And in real life when we face failure when we confront obstacle we often don't feel that way
We feel overcome We feel overwhelmed We feel anxious maybe depressed frustrated or cynical
We never have this feeling from we're playing games They just don't exist in games
So that' what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student
What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything?
How can we take those feeling from games and apply them to real-world work?
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem-olving environment
And I started to notice a few things that make epic win so possible in online world
The first thing is whenever you show up in one of his online games especially in World of Forecraft there are lots and lots of different character who are willing to trust you with a world-aving mission right away
But not just any mission it' a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game
Right? So you can do it
They never give you a challenge that you can't achieve
But it is on the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try hard
But there' no unemployment in role of warcraft; there' no sitting around bringing your hands; always something specific and important to be done
And they're also ton of collaborator
Everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission
It' not something we have in a real life that easily Uganda at our fingertip our ton of collaborator
Now I have a plan for this and it entail convincing more people including all of you to spend more time playing bigger and better games
And also there' this epic story this inpiring story of why we're there and what we're doing and then we get all this positive feedback
You guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength plus-one intelligence
We don't get the kind of constant feedback in real life
When I get off the stage I'm not going to have you know plus one speaking and plus one crazy idea plus 20 crazy idea
I don't get that feedback in real life
Now the problem with collaborative online environment like World of Warcraft is that it' so Communing to be on the verge of an epideline all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game world
It' just better than reality
So so far collectively all the road of work-craft gamers have spent 593 million years solving the virtual problems of as-orough
Now that' not necessarily a bad thing
It might sound like it' about thing
But to put that in context 593 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancetor stood up
That was the first upright primate
So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the pharmaceutical of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing
But it' also act because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we're actually changing what we are capable of as human being
We're evolving to be more collaborative and hearty species
Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games
This is who I believe this
So consider this really interesting statistic -- it was recently published by Research Carnegie Mellon University -- the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 2016
Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons
First of all for children in the United States 10,000 80 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendment
So we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school
Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell' new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the 10,000-hour theory of success
Some of you might be thinking that' a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world
It' based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anything by the age of 21 we will be virtuosis
We'll be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world
And so now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers
So the big question is what exactly are gamers getting so good at?
Because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
This is how many people we had all have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games
These are our virtuoso gamers -- 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something
And in the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is
If you don't know it already this is coming
The game industry is developing conoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone network instead of broadband Internet so that gamers all over the world particularly in India China Brazil can get online
They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade
There bring up to 15 billion gamers
So I started to think about what these games are making us virtuos at
Here are the four things I came up with
OK think of this as extreme self-motivation
Ergent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success
But actually according to my research at the Institute for the future it' actually the opposite is true
Gameers always believe that an epic one is possible and then there' always worth trying and trying now
Game results it around
Gameers are virtuososos at weaving a tight social intervention
It' a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they beat them us badly
And the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone
We trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it' over
And so playing a game together actually build up bond and trust and cooperation
And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result
Bliful productivity I love it
You know there' a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer play for 22 hours a week kind of a half-time job
It' because we know when we're playing a game that we're actually bathroom working hard than we are relaxing or hanging out
We know that we are optimized as human being to do hard and meaningful work
And gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they're given the right work
Finally epic meaning
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world' most urgent problems
Gameers love to be touched to all inpiring mission to human planetary-scale stories
So just one bit of trivia that help put that into perspective so you all know knock biggest wiki in the world
Second biggest wicking in the world with nearly 80,000 article is the world of warcraft wicky
Five million people use it every month
They have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wicking in the world
They are building an epic story
They are building epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft
Okay so these are four superpower that add up to one thing: gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals
These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world
And the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual world and not the real world
That' the problem that I'm trying to solve
In fact I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically
There' in the conmiing Edward Caionova
His work is brilliant
He looks at why people are investing so much time in energy and money in online world
And he says "We're witnessing what amount to know less than a mass exodut to virtual world and online game environment."
And he' an economist so he' rational
And he says "So?"
Not like me I'm a game designer I'm exuberant
But he says that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in all my world and they can in real life
They can have stronger social relationships in games and they have in real life they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life
So he says "For now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual world in the real world."
Now I also agreed that that is rational for now
But it is not by any means an optimal situation
We have to start making the real world work more like a game
I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago
These are ancient dice made out of sheep snuckles
I've chemistryd the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week
Before we had awesome game controller we had sheep snuckles
And these represent the first game equipment designed by human being and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian horoticists you might know this history which is the history of who invented games and why
Ronata says that games particularly dice games were invented in the kingdom of Lydia during a time of famine
Apparently there was such a severe famine that the king of litia decided they had to do something crazy
People were suffering people were fighting
It was an extreme situation and they needed an extreme solution
So according to Roticus they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom-wide policy on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games
And they would be so immered in playing the dice games because games are so engaging in immerive and such Communing bliful productivity they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat
So that' probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so I'll say it again let it sink in and if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict acquire I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week by the end of the next decade
And then on the next day they would play games and on the next day they would eat
And according to Veronatists they passed 18 years this way surviving the refamine by eating on one day and playing games on the next
Now this is exactly I think how we're using games today
We're using games to trigger real-world suffering we're using games to get away from everything that' broken in the real environment everything that' not Communing about real life and we're getting what we need from games
But it doesn't have to end there
This is really exciting
According to her auditors after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better so the king decided they would play one final dice game
They divided the entire kingdom in half
They played one dice game and the winner of that game got to go on an epic adventure
They would leave media and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive
Now this sounds crazy right?
But recently DNA evidence has shown that the atrocan who then led to the Roman Empire actually share the same DNA as the ancient living
And so recently scientists have suggested that heroitageous as crazy story is actually true
And geologist have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine
So this crazy story might be true
They might have actually saved their culture by playing games ecaping to games for 18 years and then been so inspired and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually save the entire civilization that way
OK we can do that
We've been playing warcraft since 1994
That was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series
It played dice games for 18 years We've been playing work after 16 years
I say "We are ready for our own epic game."
Now they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so that' where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game play from
Let' get half of us to agree to spend an hour-day playing games until we solve real-world problems
Now I know you are asking: How are we going to solve rural problems in games?
Well that' what I have devoted my work to over the past few years at the intitute for the future
We have this banner in our office in Palo Alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future
We do not want to try to predict the future
What we want to do is make the future
We want to imagine the best case scenario outcome and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality
We want to imagine epic wind and then give people the means to achieve the epic wind
I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic win in their own future
So this is world without oil
We made this game in 2007
This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage
The oil shortage is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it' real and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil
So when you come to the game you tell us where you live and then we give you real-time news video that show you exactly how much oil cost what' not available how food yourselves being affected how transportation being affected and with schools are closed if there' rioting and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true
"No I'm serious I am."
And we got talking about music and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violent lesson with me
Now I should mention that Nathaniel refuse treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuff and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life
But as a result now he has prone to these schizophrenic grandparents the worst of which can manifest natural as him exploding and then troubleing for days wandering the street of Skid Row exposed to it horror with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him
And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walter and the concert hall He had a kind of manic glint in his eyes He was lost
And he was talking about invisible demon and smoke and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep
One day Lo Angeles Times called and his Steve Lopez was walking along the street of downtown Lo Angeles when he heard beautiful music
And I was afraid not for myself but I was afraid that I was going to lose him that he was going to sink into one of his state and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scale and our Pedgeo as an other exciting form of didactic violin pedagogy
So I just started playing
And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Island Cancero
And as I played I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel' eyes
It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible 2011 a chemical reaction for which my playing the music was it catalyt
And Nathaniel' manic rage was transformed into understanding a quiet curiosity and in grace
And in a frequent he lifted his own violin and he started playing by ear certain slippet of violent contributor which he then asked me to complete Mendel' and Czechoski' surveillance
And we started talking about music from back to Beethoven and Bram Brooklyn all the bees from Bartok all the way up to Sir Picasolamen
And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic technology of music but he related to this music at a personal level
He spoke about it with a kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Lo Angeles Philharmonic
And the source was a man an African-American man charming rugged homeless playing a violin that only had two string
And through playing music and talking about music this man had transformed from the paranoid strategiesed man that had just come from walking the street of downtown Lo Angeles to the charming Airyudite brilliant Juliar Train musician
Music is medicine music changes us
And for Nathaniel music is sanity
Because music allows him to take his thought and deluions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity into reality
And that is in a scape from his traumated state
And I understood that this was the very essence of art
This was a very reason why we made music that we take something that exist within all of us at our very fundamental core our emotions and through our artistic lens through our creativity we're able to shape those emotions into reality
And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and move us inspire and unites us
And for Nathaniel music brought him back into a fold of friends
The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musician that understood him that recognized his talent and respected him
And I will always make music with Nathaniel whether we're at Walt Disney Conert Hall or on Skid Row because he remind me why I became a musician
Thank you
I'm telling a story that many of you know because Steve' column became the basis for a book which was turned into a movie with Robert Downing junior Acting Steve Lopez and Jamie Fox as Nathaniel Anthony Aers the Juliara train double basis whose promiing career was cut short by a tragic afliction with paranoid schizophrenia
Have a look at us
You can place it in that I shamelessly stole from chelus
So please forgive me
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard he suffered a complete breakdown and 30 years later he was living homeless on the street of Skid Row in downtown Lo Angeles
I encourage all of you to read Steve' book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that form between these two men but how music helped shape that bond and ultimately was instrumental if you'll partner to pond in helping the family'll get off the street
I met Mr Aires in 2008 two years ago at Walt Disney Conert Hall
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven' first and Fort Simpanies and came backtage and introduced himself
And speaking in a very Joviald and rigorous way about Yo-Yo-Ma and the Hillary Clinton and how the dodge were never going to make the world' series all because of the treachers' first violent passage work in the last movement of Atoman' fourth symphony
It rehaped the democracy of the globe in a way that no more ever has
It' gone It' vanished
We vanquished it Puff
In the rich world disease that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly
Dipteria rebellar polio
Does anyone even know what those things are?
Vaccine modern medicine our ability to feed billion of people -- those are triumph of the scientific method
And to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishment of humanity
So that' the good news
Unfortunately that' all the good news because there' some other problems and they've been mentioned many times
And one of them is that despite all our accomplishment a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day
That number' rising and it' rising really rapidly and it' disgraceful
Not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe
Quortable water arable land rainforest oil gas -- they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to
So the question is can we do that? And I think we can
I think it' clear that we can make food that will feed billion of people without raping the land that they live on
A big machine a cool TEDish machine and it' a time machine
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it
I really do believe that and no in eight wishful thinking
But here' this thing that keep me up at night -- one of the things that keep me up at night -- we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never
And we've also never been in a position that Obamaed properly in the way that we can today
We're on the verge of amazing events in many field and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more front than we do now
And everyone in this room has to get into it
People wrap natural in their belief and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free
Not even the truth will set them free
And listen everyone' entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress
But you know where you're not in title too
You're not entitled to your own fact sorry you're not
And this took me a while to figure out
And you can go backwards you can go forward you cannot stay where you are
About a decade ago I wrote a story abouté from the New Yorker a little story
And I was negotiation to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history
I'm no way to do So I just did what I do I wrote a story and I moved on
Soon after that I wrote a story about genetically engineered food
Same thing only bigger
People were going crazy
So I wrote a story about that too and I couldn't understand why people thought this was Frank and Food why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trepaing on nature' ground
And I wonder what you choose because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back
But you know I do what I do I wrote this story I moved on
I mean I'm a journalist I mean I'm a journalist I mean I'm a journalist
We type we file we go to dinner that' fun
These stories bothered me and I couldn't figure out why and eventually I did
And that' because of those fanatic that we're driving me crazy we're actually fanatic at all
They were fossil people educated people these in people
They were exactly like the people in this room
And it just strategiesed me so much
But then I thought "Let' be honest."
We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to
We talk about it ambivalently
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quote around it -- progress
OK there are reasons for that and I think we know what those reasons are
We've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there' no reason we can do it
I don't know they want to go back before there were believing or Twitter or American idol
You could just say a few name and people will understand
Chernobyl Bopole the challenger viac weapon of mass destruction hanging chad
You know you can choose your list
There are questions in problems with the people we use to believe we're always right so be intersectional
Ask questions: demand proof demand evidence
Don't take anything for granted
But here' the thing: when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that
And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again
About 12 years ago there was a story published a suspect story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles monk in rebellaé shot
I don't know I don't know
Very scary very scary
Ton of studies were done to see if this was true
Ton of studies should have been done It' in a serious issue
The data came back
The data came back from the United States from England from Sweden from Canada and it was all the same: no correlation no connection none at all
I'm convinced that there' some sort of pulled to notalgia to wishful thinking
It doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdote We believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real
We don't believe a bunch of document from a government official giving us data and I do understand that I think we all do
But you know what?
The result of that has been disastrous
Diaster because here' the fact that the United States is one of the only countries in the world where theé rate for measles is going down
That is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves
It' suspect
What kind of a saying happened that we could do that?
Now I understand it I do understand it
And I understand that now and I understand that
Because anyone have measles here
There' one person in this audience ever see someone die of muel
It doesn't happen very much
It doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year
I'm not part of that crowd I have to say
That' a lot of death of measles 20 an hour
But since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our mind and people like Jenning McCarthy can go around preaching message of fear and a literacy from platform like Oprah and Larry KingLive
And they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation
They don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same
And it' something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon
I don't want to go back and it' not because I'm adventure
This guy was a hero Jonaault
He took one of the worst scourge of mankind away from us
No fear no agony polio pushed gone
Back guy in the middle not so much
His name is Pleuro acid
He just developed a Rottervirué with a bunch of other people
It all saved the lives of 400 500,000 kids in the developing world every year
It' because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward
Pretty good right?
Well it' good except the problem goes around talking abouté and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the winning
And he actually says it that way
So positive terrorist
When Paul speak in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guard
He gets called it home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school
And why? Because Paul made aé
I don't need to say this buté are essentially
You take them away disease comes back suspect disease and that' happening
We have measles in this country now
And it' getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it' just a number' game
So I want to get in the machine and I want to go forward
And they're not just going to die of measles
What about polio? Let' have that Why not?
A college class made of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said "You know she thought it was a little strident."
No one' ever said that before
She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way
Fight five five five five
Why? Because we don't have polio when you know what
We didn't have polio in this country yesterday
Today I don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in Lago this morning and he' flying to LAx right now he' over Ohio
This is the greatest time there' ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose: health wealth mobility opportunity declining rate of disease
And he' going to land in a couple hours he' going to run a car and he' going to come to Long Beach and he' going to tend one of these fabulous TED dinner tonight
And she doesn't know that he' infected with a paralytic disease and we don't either because that' the way the world works
That' the planet we live on Don't pretend it isn't
Now we love to wrap ourselves in lie We love to do it
Everyone take their vitamin this morning
Econese she'll look like a nation little antioxidant to get you going
I know you did because half of Americans do every day
They take this stress and they take alternative medicine and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless
The data says it all the time
They darken your urine they almost never do more than that
OK you want to pay 28 billion dollars for a dark urine
I'm totally with you
Dark urine dark
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?
Well I think I understand we hate big farmer
We hate big government We don't trust the man
And we should it Our healthcare system suck
It' cruel to millions of people
It' absolutely facility cold and soul-debending to those of us who can even afford it
So we run away from it and where do we run?
We leap into the arm of big placebo
That' fantastic I love big coffee
But you know it' really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billion of dollars on it
And I have all sort of little prop here
None of it Ginco Fraud Accademation Fraud a guy -- I don't even know what that is but we're spending billion of dollars on it It' fraud
And you know what when I say this stuff people CEO at me and they say "Would it care? But people do what they want to do It makes them feel good."
There' never been a time like this
And you know what? You're wrong
Because I don't care if it' the Secretary of ACHS who' saying whom? I'm not going to take the evidence of my expert on mammogram or some cancer clock who want to treat his patient with costing animals
When you start down the road we're belief in magic replace evidence and science you end up in a place you don't want to be
My great jewel died all of them by the time they were 60
You end up in Tabow and Beckey' South Africa
He killed 400,000 of his people by inisting that big route Garlic and Reminoil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS
Hundred of thousands of leaveless death in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease
Please don't tell me there are no consequence to these things
There are They're always arm
Now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this certain battle between proponent of genetically engineered food and the organical leak
My jewel pushed that number to 70
It' an idiotic debate It has to stop
It' a debate about words about metaphor
It' therapies It' not science
Every single thing we eat every grain of rice every spring of parsely every brusel sprout has been modified by man
You know there weren't tangering in the garden of Eden
There wasn't any canalop; there were Christmas trees; we made it all
My parents are closing in on ED
We made it over the last 11,000 years
And some of it worked and some of it didn't
We got rid of the stuff that didn't
Now we can do it in a more precise way and there are risk absolutely but we can put something like vitamin A into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their law
So they're better be it They're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number
You don't want to do that
I have to say I don't understand it
We object to genetically engineered food
Why do we do that? Why do we do that? Why do we do that?
Well the things I constantly hear are too many chemical -- peticide hormone monoculture -- we don't want giant field of the same thing that' wrong
We don't want companies patenting light
We don't want companies owning seed
And you know what my response to all of that is?
Yes you're right Let' fix it
It' true We've got a huge food problem that this isn't science
This is nothing to do with science
It' light It' morality It' patent stuff
You know science isn't a company
It' not a country
It' not even an idea; it' a process
It' a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do it job because we're afraid is really very deadning and it' preventing millions of people from propering
But it' not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that
You know in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now -- 70 percent
This is investment in Africa over the last 30 years
Digraceful disgraceful
They need it and we're not giving it to them
And why? Genetically engineered food
We don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like Caava for instance
Because I was something that half a billion people needed
It' kind of like a potato
It' just a bunch of calories it' sock
It doesn't have nutrient It doesn't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to disagree those blind
They wouldn't starve and you know what?
That would be nice It wouldn't be shaped in his but it would be nice
And all I could say about this is why are we fighting it?
A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest men in the world did a hundred years ago
And you must ask ourselves why are we funny?
Because we don't want to move genes around
This is about moving genes around It' not about chemical
It' not about our ridiculous passion for hormone our inistence on having bigger food better food singular food
This isn't about race crispies this is about given people alive and it' about time we started to understand without men
Because you know something
If we don't if we continue to act the way we're acting we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of high-tech colonialism
There' no other way to describe what' going on here
It' selfish it' ugly it' intuitive us and we really have to stop it
So after this amazingly fun conversation
You might want to say "So you still want to go in this ridiculous time machine and go forward."
Abolutely Abolutely I do
It' stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity
We can set that time machine on any thing we want
Think about that It' an incredible fact
We can move it where we want to move it and we're going to move it where we want to move it
We have to have these conversation and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we're going to be happy we do
I know that we can and as far as I'm concerned that' something the world needs right now (Applause) Thank you (Applause) Thank you (Applause) Thank you (Applause) Thank you (Applause) Thank you (Applause) Thank you (Applause) Thank you (Applause)
And why is it true?
Smallpox -- smallpox killed billion of people on this planet
So there are a number of people who have a lot more -- oh moment than others -- and among the worst are recent graduate of business school
They lie they cheat they get distracted and they produce really lame structure
And of course there' team that have a lot more to those structure and among the best are recent graduate of kindergarten
And it' pretty amazing
As Peter tell this not only do they produce the tallest structure but the most interesting structure of them all
So the question you want to ask is how come why? What is it about them?
And Peter'd like to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be scream spaghetti ink right?
They don't spend time joking for pirate
But there' another reason as well
And the reason is that business students are trained to find this single right plan right?
Some of years ago here at TED Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the Mars Mellow Challenge
And then they execute on it
And then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on top they run out of time and what happens
It' a crisis
Sound familiar right?
What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypeocracyive prototype always keeping the marshmallow in top so they have multiple times to fix intability prototype along the way
Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process
And with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work
So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential but let' look at how different team perform
So the average for most people is around 20 inche business school students about half of that lawyer a little better but not much better than that kindergarten better than most adult
Who does the very best?
Architect and engineer thankfully
And the idea is pretty simple: team of four have to build a tallest free-tanding structure out of 26th spaghetti one-yard of tape one-yard of string and a marshmallow
39 inche of the tallest structure I've seen
And why is it? Because they understand triangle and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building?
Self contaminat the stable structure so scream a little bit better than average but who' where gets interesting?
If you put in an imagining admin on the team they get significantly better
Credible You know you look around to go that team' going to win
You just tell before him and why is that?
Because they have special skills of facilitation
They manage the process they understand the process
And any team who manage and pay a close attention to work will significantly improve the team' performance
Specialite skills and facilitation skills of the combination lead to strong success
If you have 10 team that typically perform you'll get maybe six or so that I've standing structure
And I tried something interesting
I thought let' up the anti once
So I offered a $10,000 prize of software to the winning team
So what do you think happened? These design students
What is the result?
Here' what happened (Laughter) Not one team had a standing structure
One had -- if anyone had built say a one inch structure they'd even take in the prize
So isn't it interesting that high stake have a strong impact?
We did the exercise again with the same students
What do you think happens then?
So now they understand the value of prototyping
So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best
They produce the tallest structure in the least amount of time
The marshmallow has to be on top
So there' repeat lesson for us about the nature of incentive and success
So you might ask why would anyone actually spend time running a marshmallow challenge?
And the reason is I helped create digital tools and processes to help team build cars and video games and visual effects
And what the marshmallow challenge does is it help them identify the hidden assumption
And though it seems really simple it' actually pretty hard because it force people to collaborate very quickly
Because frankly every project has it own marshmallow isn't it?
The challenge provide a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype
And so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Marshallo Challengecom
It' a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallow
There are step-by-tep instructions on this
There are crazy example from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system
These are world record that are on this as well
And the fundamental lesson I believe is that design truly is a contact sport
It demand that we bring all of our sense to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand
And sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an uh-o moment to a tadow moment
And that can make a big difference
Thank you very much
And so I thought this was an interesting idea and I incorporated it into a design workshop
(Applause)
And it was a huge success
And since then I've conducted about 70 design workshop across the world with students and designers and architect even the CTO of the Fortune 50 and there' something about this exercise that reveal very deep lesson about the nature of collaboration and I'd like to share some of them with you
So normally most people begin by orienting natural to the task
They talk about it they figure out what it' going to look like they jokky for power
Then they spend some time planning organizing they sketch in they lay out spaghetti
They've spent the majority of their time asembling the stick into ever-growing structure
And then finally just as they're running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and they stand back and put a -- they admire their work
But what really happens most of the time is that the dad turns into an Uh-oh because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse
The captain weighed me over
He said "Basel I need you to go into the house I need you to go uptair pass the fire and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes."
Thank you Thank you Thank you
That' where it is where it is where it is where
So not exactly what I was hoping for but off I went up the stair down the hall passed the real firefighters who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes
Now I know what you're thinking but I'm no hero
I carried my payload back downtair where I met my nimesis and the precious dog by the front door
We took our treasure outside to the whole motor where not surprisingly his received much more attention that did mine
Back in New York I am the head of development for a nonprofit called Robin Hood
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the home owner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home
The active kindness she noted above all others someone had even gotten her pair shoes
By both my vocation at Robin Hot and my advocation is monitor firefighter I have witnessed the act of generoity and kindness on a monumental scale but I'm also witnessed to act of grace and courage on an individual basis
You know what I'd learned you know what I'd learned you know what I'd learned
They all mattered
So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved or are on their way to achieving remarkable levels of success I would offer this reminder: don't wait
When I'm not fighting poverty I am fighting fire as the Asistant Captain of a monitor fire company
Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody' life
If you have something to give give it now
Sir food with soup kitchen clean up a neighborhood park
Be a mentor
Not every day is going to offer as a chance to save somebody' life but every day offer us an opportunity to affect one
So get in the game save the shoes
Thank you
In America there' a doctor who can peer into the future there' a nurse who can access him in eastern past and because the whole hospital working together there' a family who can breathe easy right now where somewhere in America we've already answered some of the nation' toughest healthcare questions and the over 60,000
Now in our town where the monitor supplement a highly skilled career staff you have to get to the fire seem pretty early to get in on any action
People of semen are ready to do it
I remember my first fire
I was the second monitor on the scene so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get it
It was still it was the real foot race against the other monitor skipped to the captain in charge to find out what our asignment would be
When I found the captain he was having a very engaging conversation with the home owner who was surely having one of the worst days of her life
Here it was the middle of the night she was standing outside in the pouring rain under Numbrella in her pajama' barefoot while her house was in flame
The other monitor who had arrived just before me let' call him "Lex Luther."
(Applause)
Got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner' dog
I was stunned with jealousy
Here was some lawyer or money manager who for the rest of his life gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature just because he beat me by five second
Well I was next
But unfortunately Bonobo had the least understood of the great ape
They leave in the depth of the Congolese rhino and it has been very difficult to study them
Their Congo is a paradox a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty but also the heart of darkness itself the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claim -- nearly as many lives as the first world war
Not surprisingly this destruction also engage Bonobo' survival
Push me trade and forest law means we couldn't feel a small stage in with all the one numbers that are left in the world and we're not even sure that to be honest
Yet in this land of violence and chaos you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees
I just came back from a community that hold a secret to human survival
Who are these person?
We know them as they make love not war ape since they have miracle promicuous and biexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues
Now I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanities problems -- this is there' more to be no life than the camera
It was like you must love to play throughout their entire lives
Play not just child' games
For us and them play fromdational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance
It' where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game
Play increase creativity and resilience and it' all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interaction diversity of behavior diversity of connection
It' a place where women run the show how sex to say "hello" and "player rules a day," where fun is serious business
And when you watch below play you're seeing the very evolutionary root of human laughter doubt and ritual
Play is the glue that bind us together
Now I don't know how you play but I want to show you a couple of unique clip fresh from the wild
First it' a ball game Bonobo' style and I do not mean football
So here we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game
Have look what she' doing
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase "She' got him by the wall."
Only for -- I think he' rather loving it here right?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
So sex play is common in both bonobo and humans
And this feed is really interesting because it shows -- (Laughter) -- this video is really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play such as statistical (Laughter) And so how play both require trust and foster stressed while at the same time being tremendous fun
But place the shape shifted
For correspond ship shifted and it can take many form and some of which are more quiet imaginative cure maybe wonder is discovered anew
No this is at burning men or Southeat school
And I want to tell you to see if this is Fuko a young female and she' quietly playing with water
I think like care we sometimes play alone and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our arter world
And is that playful curiosity that drive us to explore dries us to interact and then the unexpected connection we form are the real hug but for creativity?
So these are just small tasters into the insight that Bonobo gives us to a pastor present
But they also hold a secret for a future a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world to greater creativity and graduate cooperation
The secret is that play is the key to newscapacities
In other words play is our adaptive wild card
Ladies and gentlemen media cain
In order to adapt successfully to a changing world we need to play
But will we make the most of our playfulness?
Play is not frivolous
Please essential
For Bonobo say humans alike life is not just red in tooth and clone
In times when it seems at least a proper to play it may be the times when it' most urgent
And so my fellow primate -- let us embrace this gift for our evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity fellowship and wonder
This is the world of wild Bonobo in the rhino of Congo
Thank you Thank you
Bonobo are together with chimpanzee you live in closet relative
That means we all share a common ancetor an evolutionary grandmother who lived around six million years ago
Now chimpanzee are well known for their agggreion
But unfortunately we have made too much of an emphais of this aspect in our narrative of human evolution
But Bonobo show us the other side of the coin
What chimpanzee are dominated by big scary guys Bonobo' society is run by empowered female
This guy really worked something out since this lead to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet
So let me now introduce you "Huff or the human universal load carriers."
I can carry two round over very terrain for many hours
It' flexible design allows for geep squat crawl and high-edgility movement
It sense what I want to do where I want to go and then augment my strength and endurance
We are ready with our intestee partner to introduce this device this new exoskeleton on this year
So this for real time so this for real time
Now let' turn our head towards the simplicity users something that I am particularly passionate about
There are 68 million people estimated to be in simplicity worldwide
I want you to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities or another one that takes wheelhiel act standing and walking again
This is about one percent of a total population
And that' actually a Wikipedia estimate
We're here talking here about oftentime very young individuals with spinal cord injuries that in the prime of the live 2030 40 hit the wall and the wind is the only option
But it' also the aid-ing population that is moved to lying a numbers
And the only option pretty much but it' stroke or all the complications is the windhire
And that is actually for the last 500 years since it' very successful negotiate I must say
So we thought he would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility
Let me now introduce you to elex that is warn by a manta Boxto and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years
A mentor a mentor a mantra a mantra a manta
EM: That is wearing our eelic like sad
It has sensor
It' completely an uninvaive sensor in the crutche that send signal back to an on-poor computer that is sitting here after back
There are battery pack here as well that power motor that are sitting after hip as well as panic joint that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very themselves gait
I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak some asault while Dan Helkind paralyzed me
In a split second I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvi
Not long afterwards a doctor strawed into my hospital room and he said "Amander you'll never walk again."
And that was 19 years ago
He robbed every ounce of hope from my being
Adoptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to damn hell' skin again to rock climate even Hannacycle
But nothing has even invented that enable me to walk until now
We are Turkey bionic called these robots exoskeleton
(Applause)
You can see we have the technology we have the platform to say down and have discussion with you
It' in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generation not only for the soldier or for a manta here and all of these users but for everyone
Thank you
These are nothing else done something that you put on in the morning and it will give you extra strength and it will further rabbi your speed and it will help you for instance to manage your balance
It is actually that through integration of the man and the machine
But not only that it will integrate and network you to the universe and other device out there
This is just not some blue sky thinking
To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier that on average thus carry about 100 pounds on their back and they are being asked to carry more equipment
coordinate this is resulting in so major complications back in series 30 percent of them chronic back injuries
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an extra skeleton that would help deal with this issue
According to burrow the movie "Premiered" in January and since then and this is even the whole thing -- we've had more than 900 million media impression for this film
That' a little covering just like a two-and-a-half-week period
That' only online no print no TV
The film hasn't even been distributed yet
It' not even online It' not even streaming
It' not even been out into other foreign countries yet
So ultimately this film was already started to gain a lot of momentum
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talk to advise their client not to take part
What I always believe is that if you take chance if you take risk that in those risk we'll come opportunity
I believe that when you push people away from that you're pushing them more towards failure
To buy the naming right to the talk you're watching right now that at the time didn't have a title didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hands to what the subject matter would actually be
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk-averse then you're preparing your whole company to be reward-changed
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risk
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them
Ultimately moving forward I think we have to embrace fear
We've got to put that bear in a cage
Embrace fear embrace risk
One big spoon fall at a time We have to embrace race
And ultimately we have to embrace transparency
Today more than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way
And that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embraced transparency has been brought to you by my good friends at ENC who for 7100 dollars bought the naming right on eBay
Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world
EMC present embrace transparency
Thank you very much guys
Chris Anderson: So organ in the name of transparency what exactly happened to that seven?
That is a fantastic question
I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization of the TED Foundation the Sapling Foundation a check for 7100 dollars to be applied towards my attendance for next year' TED
So what you're getting was this: Your name here present my TED Talk: "Did you have no idea what the subject is and depending on the content could ultimately blow up in your face especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it?"
But that being said it' a very good media opportunity
(Applause)
You know how many people watch these TED Talk
It' a lot
That' just a working title by the way
So even with that caveat I knew that someone would buy the namely right
Now if you had to ask me that a year ago I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty
But in the new project I'm working on my new film we examine the world of marketing legislat
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situation that are usually very difficult and at the same time library dangerous
And as I said earlier I put myself in some pretty suspect situation over the years but nothing could prepare me nothing could ready me for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the room with these guys
You see I had this idea for a moving
What I want to do is make a film all about product placement marketing and legislat where the entire film is funded by proto-placement marketing and legislat
So the movie will be called the greatest movie ever solved
So what happens in the greatest movie ever sold is that everything from top to bottom who start to finish is branded from beginning to end you know from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie which is brand X
Now this brand the qualcom stadium the you know staple center
These people will be married to the film in perpetuating forever
And so the film explore this whole idea it' well through Dum and Vermeer and Rodo
I'm a writer That was more --
In't it an imperative period for that?
But not only we're going to have the Bradex title sponsor but we're going to make so we sell out every category we can of the film
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore
The greatest car you ever drove from the Grace Movement Emerson the greatest drink you've ever had carries you the greatest movie ever solved
So the idea is beyond just showing that brand are part of your life but actually get them to finance the film is they then define us the film and actually we show the whole process of how it is at work
The goal of this whole film is transparency
I went to prison difficult
You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie
So that' the whole concept the whole film start to finish
And I would love for CEG that helped make it happen
It' funny because when I first hear it it is the ultimate respect for an audience
I don't know how receptor people are going to be to it though
Do you have a perspective or do you? I don't want to use angel because that has a negative idea I think but you think that you'll sort of know how this is going to play out Oh I'm not going to do the two
One point I don't know you but I think that you can have art done meaning with them but I think it' certainly worth puruing a couple really big office brand
Who know? Maybe by the time your film comes out we look like a bunch of blendering idiot
What do you think the response to you to me? I have woomb
And the response mostly will be no
I worked in a coal mine dangerous
The toughest cell because the film is tough so because of me
And both
I mean not so optimistic
So can you help me? Any help
I can help I can help
OK good because awesome
We've got to figure out which brand
Yeah That' the challenge When you look at the people you deal with
And we got some places we can go "OK up turn the camera."
I thought "Turn the camera off meant let' have an off-the-record conversation."
Turn out it really means we want nothing to do with your movie
And just like that one by one all of these companies suddenly troubleed
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie
I was negotiation
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project
You know I was blown away because I thought the whole concept of the idea of legislat was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible to get there as many people to see it as possible
I filmed in war zone difficult and dangerous
Socially in today' world this skeptic of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape isn't the idea to get that new buzzword the delivery vehicle it' going to get that message to the masses
And that' what I thought
But the problem was you see my idea had one fatal flaw and that flaw was this
Actually no that was not the flaw whatsoever
That wouldn't have been a problem at all
This would have been fine
But what this image represent was the problem
See when you do a Google image search for transparency this is --
(Applause)
This is one of the first images that comes up
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun of the beginning -- a little difficult in the middle -- very dangerous in the end
So I like the way you roll Sir gay bread No
This was the problem: transparency free from pre-tensor to seat easily detected or seen through readily understood characterized by visibility or accessibility of information especially Israeling business practice -- that last line being probably the biggest problem
You see we hear a lot about transparency these days
Our politician say it our president says it even our scream say it
But suddenly when it comes down with becoming a reality something suddenly changed
But why? Well transparency is scary
(Applause)
Like that odd still CEOing bear
It' unpredictable
Like this odd country road
And it' also very risky
What else is risky?
Eating an entire bowl of cool wit
That' very risky
Now when I started talking to companies telling them "We wanted to tell this story," and they said "No we want you to tell a story We want you to tell a story We just want to tell our story."
See when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of lie Maria gave me the looky off and gave me (Laughter) He would say "Son there' three side every story There' my story There' my story and there' the real story."
In fact most of my career I have been immering myself into seemingly suspect situation for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience
But you see with this film we wanted to tell the real story
But with only one company one agency willing to help me and that' only because I knew John Bon and Richard Curion bomb for years I realized that I would have to go on my own and have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself you know myself with all of my team
So what you suddenly started to realize or what I started to realize that we started having conversation with these companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem
I have friends who make great big giant Hollywood film and my friends make little independent film like I make
And the friends of mine who make big giant Hollywood movie say that the reason they're called just so successful is because of the brand partner that they have
And then my friends who make small independent film say "Well how are we supposed to compete with these big giant Hollywood movie?"
And the movie is called "The greatest movie ever sold."
It' in a house specifically what we see banned in the film
Any time I'm getting ready to go any time I open up my medicine cabinet you will see Bandyota
Well any time I do an interview with someone I could say "Are you fresh enough for this interview? Are you ready to look at all nervous? I want to help you call down so maybe you should put someone for the interview?"
So we'll offer you know one of these fabulous shows
Whether it' a floral fusion or a paradise win they'll have their chance
We have them geared for both male or female you know solid roll on your stake whatever maybe
That' the two said tour
So now I can answer near questions and give you the five set tour
We are a small brain
Much like you talk about being a smaller you know movie or very much a challenge at brand
So we don't have the budget that other brain have
So doing things like this you know remind people about them though it' kind of why we're interested in it
One of the words that you would use to describe band
Band is black
We're talking about bald out there fresh
And it freshes a great word that really spin this category into the positive versus fight odor in witness
It' -- he keep a fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh
Either we think you fresh or longer matter freshness more freshness three times fresher
Things like that that are more about positive benefit
And that' a multi-million-dollar corporation
What about me? What about a regular guy?
I need to go talk to the man on the street the people who are like me the regular Joes
They need to tell me about my brand
How would you guys describe your brain?
I'm my brain
I'd like you to see
I like really nice clothes
Eighty-urvival needs skater punk and that' it bloggery day
Like what is brain jerry?
Unict unique I guess will kind of genre of Stylaam with me dark glamour
I like a lot of black color a lot of graze and stuff like that
But usually some have an accessory like sunglaes or like crystal and things like bad too
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world at branding and sponsorship I knew I would want to do something a little different
And where a brand he might be a classic converible mistake there
The brain that I am is I would call it caual flag
The part hippie part Yo-Being part of Brooklyn Girl and a little --
From the PECGA from the PEC guy
I sell head toy all over the country all over the world
So I guess that' my brain
In my work with all industry that' my brain
My brain is FedEx because I deliver the good
Fail' writer Manhattanic friend
Because that' not a thing but it' not a thing
A lawyer brand I'm tall
Well we can't all be grandtime but I do often find myself with the skeptic of dark glamour and caual fly
What I realized I needed an expert
I think somebody could get inside my head somebody could really help me understand what they call your brand personality
And so I found a company called Olson Zalman and Pittburgh
They've helped companies like Neley for Breeze Hallmark discover that brand personality
If they could do it for them surely they could do it for me
You write pictures right?
I did the very first picture as a picture of my family
I'll tell you a little bit how it relate to you about some feeling about who you do
So some of you may or may not have heard a couple weeks ago I took out an ad on eBay
The people who shape the way I look at the world
Tell me about this world
It' the -- I think your world is the world that you live in like people that are run to your friends your family the way you live your life a job you do
All those things stem and started from one place and for me this demon started with my family and West Virginia
The next one this was the best day ever
How does this really dot some feeling about who you are?
Like who do I want to be?
I like things that are different
I like things that are weird I think we're going to make things
Turn about the Wi-Face what does that do for us?
What does the machine look at people' stage are you in now?
I'm important to me but who is the Red Metrison?
I'm going to give it up to you that cosmic value that' going to happen anywhere in the world
I was a mother and I didn't want to see it
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
If you're a patient Chris I'll have an exhilarating
I don't know what you're going to call this
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there
The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct but complementary size to your brand personality: the Morgan Spirllock brand as a mindful play brand
I sent out some Facebook message some Twitter message and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming right to my genuine TEDTalk
Those are kind of juxtapoed very nicely together
And I think there' almost a paradox with those
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their string or the other instead of focusing on both
Most companies tend to as human nature to avoid things that they're not sure of avoid fear those elements and you really embrace those and you actually turn them into positive audience It' a neat thing to see
What other brand are like that?
The first one here is a classic Apple
And you can see here to target we many from many coupers and jet blue
Now there' playful brand and mindful brand those sort of things that have come and gone but a playful mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing
A playful life of brand What is your brain?
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity your brand personality what would you be?
Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?
Are you more of a down atributor?
Are you something in front of more calm reserved Wikipedia?
Up attribute of things like being playful being fresh like the fresh print contemporary adventurous edgier daring like Aral Flint nimbler agile profane dominarying magical or mytical like Gandolf
Or are you more with down attribute?
Are you mindful sophisticated like double-loop seven?
Are you established traditional nurturing protective empathetic like the Oprah?
Are you reliable stable familiar safe secure sacred contemplative or wive like the Dalai Lama or Yoda?
Over the course this film we had 500 plus companies who were up and downcoming say no they didn't want any part of this project
They wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they had no control; they would have no control over the final product
But we did get 17 brand partner who were willing to relinquish that control who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful in his playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell -- stories that an associationr would normally never get behind
That' right Some lucky individual corporation four profit or nonprofit was going to get the one in a lifetime opportunity because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again
They enabled us to tell this story about neural marketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRIS to target the desire center of your brain for both commercial as well as movie marketing
We went to São Paulo where they Internationaled outdoor legislat
In the entire city for the past five years there' no billboard there' no posters there' no flyers nothing
(Applause)
And we went to school district where now companies are making their way into cash-trap schools all across America
What' incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten in the most feedback out of her I've had the most success in or one where I've interacted with things directly
And that' what these brand did
They cut out the middle man they cut out the agencies and said "Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind I'm going to deal directly with the artist I'm going to work with him to create something different Something that' going to get people thinking It' going to challenge the way we look at the world."
And how has that been for them has it been successful?
Well since the film "Promier to the Sun and Film Festall," let' just take a look
I committed his brother and his father right then and then I'm like "Here' a deal Tony' going to speak we're going to get him a machine and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again because it' a travety that someone who still has all of that in them isn't able to communicate it."
So I spoke at a call from a couple months after that
I met these guys called JRL graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project the light on in any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on it and it just register the negative space
So they go around and do our installations like this
All the things that go up there they said "There' a life cycle."
First it start with the sexual organ then it start with cus words then it was bush you know slanders and then people actually got to art
But there was always a life-cycling presentation
So I went home when I was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this and we were like "Well wait a second If we know that this technology exist where you can use your eyes to control things why don't we figure out a way for tempt to control the laser and he can do graphically Without them."
I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects
So that started the journey
And about two years later about a year later after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around we'd accomplished a couple things
One we battered down the door of the insurance companies and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine
Which was awesome?
And he is seriously one of the funny -- I call him Yoda because you talk to the guy you get an email from him and you're like "I'm just I'm not worthy This guy is so amazing."
The other thing we did is we flew seven programmer from all over the world literally every corner of the world into our house
But the coolest project I ever worked on was around this guy
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage and these hackers and programmer and conpiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house
A lot of our friends that we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graph on the wall
But for over two weeks we programmed we went to the Venez Boardwalk my kids got involved my dog got involved and we created this
This is called the eyewriter and you can see the disgust
This is a cheap pair of sunglaes that we bought at the Venez beach boardwalk some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot Radio Shack
We took a PS3 camera hacked it open put it down into an LED light and now there' a device that is free you build this yourself we published the code for free you download the software for free
This guy' name is TEPT
And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitation
There' no insurance company that can say no
Tempt was one of the four most graffiti artist in the '80
There' no hospital that can say no
Anybody who' paralyzed now has access to actually draw communicate using all their eyes
Thank you Thank you
The guy' very much -- that was awesome
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to Times' room
I love this picture because this is someone else' room and that' his room
So there' all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling
And after a year of planning two weeks of programming and carbed fast and all-night session Tony drew again for the first time in seven years
And he came home from a run one day and said "Madaad my legs are tingling."
And this is an amazing picture because this is his life support system and he' looking over his life support system
We kicked his bed so that he could see out
And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital
And he drew again for the first time in front of his family and friends and it' just like you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was
And that was the onset of ALS
The finding we had to break into the parking lot too so we totally felt like we were legit and the whole graph into ...
So at the end of this he sent us an email and this is what the email said "That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years I feel like I'd been held underwater and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe."
So tempt is now completely paralyzed
And that also
So that' kind of our battle cry
That' what keep us going and keep us developing
And we've got such a long way to go with this This is --
This is an amazing device but it' the equivalent of an extra sketch
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserve so much more
So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better faster stronger
Since that time we've had all kinds of acknowledgement
We've won a bunch of award
He only has use of his eyes
Memory it' free None of us are making a money on this thing
It' all coming out of real pocket
So the words were like "Oh this is fantastic."
Armtrong Twittered about us and then in December of Time Magazine Otterness is one of the top 50 invention of 2010 which is early thought
(Applause)
The coolest thing about this -- and this is what' kind of completing the whole circle is in an April of this year at the Geoffen Moka in downtown Lo Angeles -- there' going to be a exhibition called Art of the street
I was exposed to him when I was exposed to him
And art of the street is going to have pretty much the bad as of the street art scene: banky shepherd fairy cause -- all of these guys will be there
Temp going to be in the show (Laughter) It' just pretty odd
I have a company that does design and animation obviously graffiti is definitely intricate part of what we admire and in respect in the art world
So basically this is my point: If you see something that' not possible make it possible
Everything in this room was impossible -- this stage is computer this mic the eyewriter it wasn't possible at one point
Make it possible Everyone in this room
I'm not a programmer never got anything with ocular recognition technology but I just recognize something and associate it myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something that you feel that needs to be done if not now then when and if not me then who?
Thank you guys
And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony and attempt and his cause
So I went and met with his brother and father and said "You know we're going to give you this money What are you going to do with it?"
And his brother said "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me."
And I said "Well wait to say isn't that I've seen Stephen Hawking and don't all paralyzed people have that ability to communicate and view these device?"
And he said "No we're unless you're in the upper asural and you've got really amazing insurance You can't actually do that These device aren't accessible to people."
Everyone seen this movie a diving bowl in the butterfly
That' how they communicate so run their finger along
I said "That' archaic How can that be?"
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check and instead I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face
And most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely?
For better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us
The great 20th-century geneticist TG dub Janzky who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Beijing once wrote an eay that he titled "Nothing in Biology" makes sense except in the light of evolution
Thank you
Now if you were one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing a take out your personal communication device I give you permission and perhaps take another look at Catherine Schultz' book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you
But if you do accept biological evolution consider this: I it just about the past or is it about the future?
Does it apply to others or does it apply to us?
This is another look at the tree of life
In this picture I've put a bush with a center branching out in all direction because if you look at the edge of the tree of life every existing species at the tip of those branches has phenomenoned in evolutionary terms it has survived It has demonstrated a fitness to it environment
How would you like to be better than you are?
The human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in
We branched off of a common ancetor to modern chimpanzee about six or eight million years ago
In the interval there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominid
Suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker
Some have come and gone
We have been here for about 130,000 years
It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same
Do you realize that we can take advantage in common dear the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human inul and use to treat diabetic?
This is not like human insulin; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas
And speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body
Maybe 10 times more
I mean think of it when Anthony Damaia ask about your self-image "Do you think about the bacteria?"
Our gut is a wonderfully hopitable environment for those bacteria
It' warm It' dark it' moist It' very cozy
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part
It' really like an easy street for bacteria with the occasional hemisphereion of the unintended forced rush to be exit
But otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life
They help in the digestion of essential nutrient and they protect you against certain disease
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit stronger with more scaming
But what will come in the future?
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equip boys as a species?
Or are we detined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment?
Now let' take a step back in time to the Big Ben -- 14 billion years ago the Earth the solar system about four and a half billion years -- the first sign of Proto life maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth the first multi-elved organism perhaps as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as 130,000 years ago finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the the human species finally emerging in the the the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging finally emerging in the human species finally emerging in the human species finally emerging finally emerging in the
In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on Earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single measure and human life a small grace node
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?
That was us
That also contitutes the reputation portion of this talk so I hope you enjoy it
Now when I was a freshman in college I took my first biology class
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology
I became an amered of the power of evolution and I realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life of single-celled organism each cell simply divide and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells
How about living longer with good help?
But at the time multi-celled organism come online things start to change
Sexual reproduction enter the picture
And very importantly with the negotiate of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable
In fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enter in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction
Or perhaps you're one of those who' always yearned for more creativity
Now I have to confe when I was a college undergraduate I thought "OK sex death sex death for sex seem pretty reasonable at the time But with each passing years I have come to have increasing doubt
I've come to understand the sentiment of George Bern who was performing still in La Vegas well into his accumulate
And one night there' a Nakataotale room door
The answer is the door
Standing before him is a gorgeous scantally clad show girl
She looks at him and says "I'm here for super-ex."
That' fine says George "I'll take the soup."
Which one would you like the most?
(Applause)
I came to realize as a fortunate that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different
I was trying to preserve the body
I wanted to keep us healthy
I wanted to restore health from disease
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives
Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation
From an evolutionary point of view you and I are like the booster rocket designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea
Which would you like if you could have just one?
I think we would all understand the sentiment that wouldy Alan express when he said "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve it through not buy you."
Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest lived
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest
Creativity
Evolution favor those creature best adapted to their environment
That is the soul test of survival and success
At the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there Sufid cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hopitable environment for them
So what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase I would say that there are a number of possibilities
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hands Let me suit
The first is that we will not evolve
We have reached a kind of equipoly
And the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population
And secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it
A few probably about as many as there are creative people here
And by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place
Second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind themselves imposed by the force of nature
That' very good
And the argument here would be that the wheel of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable
And as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planet there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the themselves way
But there' a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility
How many would act for memory?
I call it "neo-evolution," the new evolution that is not simply themselves but errord and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make
Now how could this come about?
How could it be possible that we would do this?
oppress first the reality that people today in some culture are making choices about their offpring
Quite a few more
There in some culture aggressive to have more male than female
It' not necessarily good for the society but it' what the individual and the family are aggressive
Think also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustment that would cure or prevent disease
How about fitness?
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer' or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke?
Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes?
"Kew less."
If we look ahead these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible
What about longevity?
The Human Genome Project started in emergency and it took 13 years
It cost 27 billion dollars
The year after it was finished in 2004 you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months
Today you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pair in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week
Ah the majority that makes me feel very good as a doctor
It won't be very long before the reality will be the $1,000 human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone
Just a week ago the National Academy of Engineering awarded it drape or prize to Francis Arnold and Will in Stema two scientists who independently develop technique to encourage the themselves process of evolution to work faster and to lead to deirable protein in a more efficient way what Francis Arnold call directed Evolution in a more efficient way what France' directed evolution avolution awarded evolution
If you could have any one of these it would be a very different world
A couple of years ago the Laker Prize was ordered to the scientist Chini Ayyyyyyyyyamanka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fiber blot and by manipulating just that cell to revert to a plury potential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body
These changes are coming
The same technology that has produced the human inult and in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against natural but induced immunity against other viruses
Believe it or not there' an experimental trial going on withé against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant
I it just imaginary?
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?
These are all reality today and the future will be ever more possible
Imagine then just two other little changes
Or is it perhaps possible?
You can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offpring?
What if you could change the sperm in the ova or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offpring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemothelier reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthy your children?
And then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super-actribute -- hyper-capacities -- that better memory wear capacities that better memory that that that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent that that that changes to prevent that disease that that better memory we will also enable us to adopt that -- that better capacities that better memory that
Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED conference but I want to give you today one doctors take on the subject
Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jenning especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer?
Why not live longer?
These will be irreistible
And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attribute we want we will have converted old-tyle evolution into neo-evolution
We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next 100 years
These are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them
Will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful than is kinder?
Or will we selectively choose different attribute that we want for some of us and not for others of us?
Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile?
And basically it' a system made of two component sensing and an actuating component
What is interesting today is that real-time control system are entering certain twenter into our life
Our cities over the past few years just have been blankated with network electronic
They're becoming like computers in open air
And as computers in operator are starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated
If we fix it actually it' a big deal
Just in a side of wonder to mention cities are only two percent of the Earth' class but they are 50 percent of the world' population
There are 75 percent of energy consumption up to 80 percent of CO2 emiions
So if you're able to do something with cities that' a big deal
Beyoncidence all of this sensing in that waiting is entering our Abra vodai objects
That' from an exhibition that Poweron Tonightling is organizing it mama later this year during the summer
But that' in her everybody
It' called "Toke to me."
Well our objects our environment is starting to talk back to us
I got sended to show you
In a certain sense it' almost as if every atom out there will become in both a sensor in the actuator
In that it is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there
In a certain sense it' almost as if the old dream of my calendar
You were Michelangelo scouted the Moes at the end it said that he took the hammer through with a demoor Archimuan still see a small chip underneath and said "Shelted per can on parlialy Why don't you talk?"
Well today for the first time our environment is starting to talk back to us
Just a few example again with this idea of sensing our environment in actuating it
Well the first project I wanted to show with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab
It was four and a half years ago in Italy
And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time it had been Obamaed well up all across the world that' a cell phone network and use anonymously ignorating information from that network that' collected anyway by the operator to understand how the city works
The summer was a lucky summer 2006
It' when Italy won the soccer workup
Some of you might remember it was Italy and France playing and then Zidana at the end the head-bathing
And anyway it' only one idea
Now look at what happened that day just with volunteering activity happening on the network
Here you see the sitting
You see the Coloseum in the middle the river tigering
It' money before the match
You see the timeline on the top
Early afternoon people here and there making call and moving
The match begin silence
Friend score It is course It is course
Half time people make a quick call and go to the elsewhere
Second half in the normal time
First over time sacred sacred sacred
You can see down the headbird in the moment
I there any win? Yeah
Well that night everybody went to celebrate in the century
He' on the big peak He' on the big peak
The following day again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the Prime Indonesia at the time
It and everybody move down
You see in the image at the place called Chuk Kamaimo where since Roman times people got to celebrate who had the big parking you see the peak at Yando today
Well there' just one example how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago
Another peak example about sensing it' about not about people but about things we use in consume
Well today we know everything about where our objects come from
This is a map that shows you all the chip that form a Mac computer how they came together
But we know very little about where theme goes
So in this project we actually develop some small tag to track trash as it move through the system
So we actually started with a number of monitor who helped them in Seattle just over a year ago to tag what they were thrown away different types of things as you can see here things they would throw away anyway
Then we put a little chip either tagged onto the trash and then started following it
Here are the results we just looked up thing
from Seattle
That' her one week
Think about this as a pixel a flying pixel
This information we are realized there' a lot of inefficiencies in the system
We can actually do the same thing which much less energy
This data was not available before
But there' a lot of waste of transportation and compulive things happening
But the other thing is that we believe that actually if we see every day that the cap we are thrown away it doesn't trouble it' still somewhere on the planet
This is what we call in our lab sensible design
In the plastic bother we're thrown away every day a few days there
We show that to people then we can also promote some behavioral change
So that was the reason for the project
My colleague at MIT Asa Beterman he could tell you much more about sensing and many other things wonderful things we can do with sensing but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning and that' actuating our environment
The first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Saagal Zas Pain
It started with a question by the mayor of the city who came to us saying that Spain and South New York have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space in architecture
Let me tell you a bit about it
And the question was how could technology new technology be added to that?
Now if you take this picture I'm intelligent originally and every boy in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in former of one racing over the past couple of decades
And one of the leaders was developed at MIT and a war shop was magic of this pipe and you got valve solidar valve tab opening and closing
You create like a water curtain with pixel made of water
These pictures fall and you can write a need you can show patterns images text
And even you can approach it and you will open up to let you jump through as you see in this image
Well we presented this to Mayor Bellock
You like it very much
And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the Explorer
We called the digital water pavilion
The whole building is made of water
There' no door of window by winning a project if you open up to La Cuine
The rule talk is cover with water
And if there' a bit of win if you want to minimize flashing you can actually lower the route
Or you could close the building and the whole architecture will trouble I will trouble
You know these days are always getting us during the winter when they take the roof down of people who've been there and say "You know they demolish the building."
Now the end of all is just when it goes down the architecture almost troubleed
Here' the building working
You see the person puzzle about what was going inside
If it was myself trying not to get wet testing the sense that open the water
Well I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the things were stopped working
But actually that night it was even more fun
All the kids from Pychosa came to the building because the wealth engaging with the building became something different
Not any more aguating that would open up to latuine but the building that could still make cat and hole through the water and you had to jump without going through the water
The first was very interesting because as architect as engineer as designers we always think about how people will use the things we design
But then reality is always some predictable
And that' the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people
Now sometime ago if you wanted to win a former one race you take budget and you back your budget on a good driver a good car
Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixel the pixel made of water and then projections on them
And this is what led us to think about the following project I'll show you now
That' imagined those pixel could actually start flying
Imagine you could have small helicopter that move in the air and each of them with a small pixel in changing light almost as a cloud they can move in space
Here is Sybia
So imagine one helicopter like the one you saw before moving with others in syncrain
So you can have this flower
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this the regular configuration into dimension
It shows or in regular but in three dimension well the thing that changes is the light not the pixel fortunate
You can play with the heat-print type
Imagine your screen to just appear in different skycrape calor-ized different hyper-reolution
And if the carbon the driver were good enough then you win the right
But then the whole thing he began to say 3D kind of cloud of pictures that you can approach and move through it and see from many direction
Here is the real fly fire controlling going down from the regular greenest before
Now today if you want to win the race actually you need also something that volunteer the card in real time has a few thousand sensor collecting information from the car transmitted this information into the system and then processing it in order to go back to the car with the decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected
When you turn on the light actually you see this so the same we saw before
And imagine each of them then controlled by people
You can hybrid pick cells have in an input that comes from people from people' movement or so on so on
I wanted to show you something here for the first time
We've been working with Robert De Boller one of today' top ballet dance Sergiotwallet Metropolitan in New York and the Scali Milan and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for fly fire
Here you can see convert the dancing
You see on the left the thick says a different resolution being captured
It' got 3D scanning in real time and motion culture
So you can Vietnam the whole movement
It can go all the way too
But then once we have the fixes then you can play with them in play with color and movement and gravity and rotation
So we want to use this as one of the possible input for bifire
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on
It' sent to me working on for the Lantunal Olympic
It' called the cloud
Here is imagine that again we can involve people doing something changing our environment in almost to embark what we call cloud raising like barn raising but with a cloud
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one picture
And you know I think what is remarkable -- the tap into the past couple of years is that over the past couple of decades we went from the physical world to the digital one
This has been digitizing able to think knowledge and making that accessible through the Internet
Now today for the first time in Dubama campaign showed us that we can go from the digital work from the self-organizing power of network to the physical one
This can be in our case we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol
That was something built in the city
But tomorrow can be in order to tackle today' price and challenges think about climate change or CO2 emiion how we can go from the digital world to the physical one
So the idea that can we actually involve people in doing this thing together collectively
The cloud is a cloud again made of pixel in the same way as a real cloud is a cloud made of particles
In those particles are water where our cloud is a cloud of pixel
I a physical structure in London but cover with pixel?
You can move inside with different type of experience
You can actually see it from underneath sharing the main moment fodiolympic in 2012 then beyond and really using it as a way to connect with the community
So both physical cloud into the sky and something you can go to the top like a London' new mountain top
You can enter inside it
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night but most importantly a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top
Thank you
This is what in engineering terms you would call them "real-time control system."
Doesn't matter where you are Bombay Mexico -- it doesn't really matter
You move around and you have fun
You want to calculatee around the museum
Open the planet and in one click jump
They're in there You want to go to the end of the cardo
Keep going "Halp on who' going? Half on?"
Explore explore
Thank I haven't come to the best part
So you know I'm in front of one of my favorite painting the harvesters by Peter Brugle at the Met
I see this glass sign
If the museum has given us the image you click on it
Now this is one of the images
So this is all the metadata information
For those of you who are truly interested in that you can click this but I'm going to click this off right now
And this is one of these images that we captured and what we call gigapic so technologies
So this image for example has close to I think around 10 billion pixel
And I got a lot of people asking me "What do you get for 10 billion pixel?"
So I'm going to try to show you what you really get for 10 billion pixel
My name is Emma Zero My name is Agme
You can zoom around very simply
You know you see some fun stuff happening here
I loved this guy whose expression is priceless
But then you really want to go deep
And 18 months ago I had another job at Google and I pitched this idea of doing something with museum and art to my bo who was actually here and she allowed me to do it
And so I started playing around and I found something going on over here
And I was like "Pold on That sounds interesting."
And I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something
I did a little research spoke to a couple of my contact at the Met and actually found out that this is a game called "Scole," which involve beating a goose with a stick on shrove Tuesday
And a pantly it was quite popular
I don't know why they did it but you know I learned something about it
Now just you know we're really deep in you can really get the crack
Now just to give you some perspective I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get
Here is where we were and this is the painting
The best is yet to come so you say
So now let' just quickly jumped into the MoMA again in New York
So another one of my favorite the "Starry Night."
Now the example I showed you was all about finding detail
But what if you'd want to see brush stroke?
And what if you want to see how Wango actually created this masterpiece?
You zoom in you really go in and on
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting and I'm really going to get to the crack
This is the starry night I think you know never seen like this before
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature
There' a lot of other stuff here but I don't have time
This is the real cool part It' called "Collection."
Any one of you? Anyone of you? Anybody doesn't matter if you're rich if you're poor if you have you know a fancy you know us doesn't matter
You can go and create your own museum online create your own collection across all these images
Raise simply you go in and I've created this called the power of zoom you can just zoom around
The ambaadors based in the National Gallery
You can annotate the staff send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces
So I think in conclusion for me the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google
And it took every month
It doesn't in my opinion even come from the museum
We shouldn't say that
It really comes from these artist
And that' been my humbling experience in this
I mean I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represented properly online
A lot of fun synthesize and stories I can tell you with 17 very interesting museum from nine countries
And the biggest question I get asked nowaday is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?
And the answer is no
It' to supplement the experience
And that' it Thank you
But I'm going to focus on the demo
There' a lot of stories about why we did this
I think my personal story is explained right simply in the slide and it' access
And I grew up in India
I had a great education -- I'm not complaining -- but I didn't have access to a lot of these museum and these artwork
And so when I started traveling and going to these museum I started learning a lot
And while working at Google I try to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together
So we formed a team a great team of people and we started doing this
I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launched
So simple you can't do Google Art projectcom
You look around all these museum here
You've got to do a Fidzy you've got the MoMA the homotage the right the vango
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorite the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
Two ways of going in very simple
Click and bang you're in this museum
Now I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop
He was just a tab there and he wasn't very good at it and he kept falling over
But I bet playing with this car stop time a really valuable lesson and that' that large things don't let you get right past him and that they stay in one place
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world unless you're a particle physicist
It would be a terrible model for particle physicist because well they don't play with car stop they play with these little weird particles
And when they play with their particles they find they do all sort of really weird things like they can fly right through wall or they can be in two different places at the same time
And so they wrote down all these observation and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics
And so you know that' where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny particles
But you didn't need it to describe the large everyday objects around us
This didn't really sit well with my intuition and maybe it' just because I don't play with particles very often
This is a representation of your brain and your brain can be broken into two parts
Well I'm going to play with them sometimes but not very often
And I've never seen them
I mean nobody' ever seen a particle
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either
Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?
And I'll see you reason why it shouldn't
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that everyday object also follow quantum mechanics
So a few years ago I set off to you just that
So I made one
This is the first object that you can see that it' been in a mechanical quantum superposition
There' the left half which is the logical side and then the right half which is thesufficient
So we're looking at here as a tiny computer chip
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle
And that' this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute
This is a photograph of the object
And here when we zoom in a little bit we're looking right there in the center
And then here' a really big close-up a little piece of metal
So we're looking at it as a little chunker metal and it' shaped like a diving board and sticking out over a ledge
And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip
I went to a clean room with a fresh silicon waiter and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours
For the last step I had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool-haped toll underneath the device
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition but it needs a little help to do it
Here let me give you an analogy
You know comfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator
I mean when I'm in elevator all loan I do all sort of weird things but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I know I'm bother them or frankly scare them
And so if we add a scale to measure the artifact of each describing then we can plot our brain
Klemicanic says that inanimate objects feel the same way
The fellow passenger for an animal objects are not just people but it' also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room
And so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically we're going to have to kick out all the other passenger
And that' what we did what we did what we did
We turn off the light and then we put it in vacuum and sucked out all the air and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero
All alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal was free to act over at one it
And so we measured it motion
We found it was moving in really weird ways
Instead of just sitting perfectly still it was vibrating and the way was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding contracting bellow
And for example this would be somebody who' completely logical
And by giving in a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time something has only allowed with quantum mechanics
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic
What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time?
So let' think about the atom
So in one case all the trillion of atom that make up that chunk of metal are just sitting still and at the same time those same atom are moving up and down
There' only a precise time when they align
The rest of the time they're to localized
This would be someone whose entirelysufficient
That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places
I think this is really cool
(Applause)
Really
(Applause)
It was worth blocking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years (Laughter) Because check this out The difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as a difference between that chunker metal and you
So where would you put your brain on this scale?
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time that chunk of metal can be in two different places than why not you
I mean this is just my logical side talking
So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time what would that be like?
How would your consciousness handle your body being to localized in space?
Some of us may have opted for one of these extreme but I think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high artifact in both describing at the same time
There' one more parts of the story
It is when we warmed it up and we turned on the light and looked inside the box we showed that the piece of metal was still there in one piece
And so I had to develop this new intuition that seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space
You hear a lot talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected
Well that' that quite right
It' actually -- it' more than that it' deeper
I that those connection your connection to all the things around you literally define who you are and that' the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics?
Thank you
He felt like they're mutually exclusive or anything
You can be logical andsufficient
And so I consider myself on these people along with most of the other experimental quantum physicist me to could deal with logic to string together these complex ideas
But at the same time we needed a deal of intuition to actually make the experiment work
How do we develop this intuition what we like to play with stuff?
So we go out and play with it and then we see how it act and then we develop our intuition from them
And from there and really you do the same thing
So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time
I mean even sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time but you weren't born with this notion you developed it
Exactly one week' worth of unme is all I put in my suitcase
I'd was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possibly want to wear once I got here to poem spring
And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear
That means I found a few things
And I'd really love to show you my weak fourth of that bit right now
Does that sound good?
So as I do it I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lesson that believe it or not I have picked up in these adventure wearing nothing new
So let' start with Sunday
I call this shiny tiger
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look right
You can almost always look recruitl for under 50 dollars
I'm Jesse and this is my suitcase
This whole outfit including the jacket cost me 55 and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week
Monday color is powerful
It is almost phyiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pant
If you are happy you are going to attract other happy people to you
Tuesday fitting in is way overrated
I'd spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in
Just be who you are
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people they will not only get it they will appreciate it
But before I show you what I've got inside I'm going to make a very public confeion and that is I'm outfit obsessed
When say "Emprise your inner child."
Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress-up or that I remind them of their seven-year-old
I'd like to smile and say "Thank you."
Thursday confidence is key
If you think you look good in something you almost certainly do
And if you don't think you look good in something you're also probably right
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day in and day out
But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got with this myth
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second
If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out there is no look that you can't pull off
So there' no excuse for any of us here in this audience
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
Friday a universal truth five words per you: "Gold sequence go with everything."
And finally Saturday developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word
It' been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing and we've had great conversation
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase
I love finding wearing and more recently photographing and blogging a different colorful crazy outfit for every single occasion
So before I go home to Brooklyn I'm going to donate everything back
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it' okay to let go
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner there is always going to be another crazy colorful shiny outfit just waiting for me if I put a little love in my heart and look
Thank you very much
(Applause)
But I don't buy anything new
I get all my clothes secondhand from flee market and thirt source
(Applause) Thank you
Second hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallets
I get to meet all kinds of great people my dollars usually go to a good cause I look pretty unique and in these shopping like my own personal treasure hunt
I mean what am I going to find today?
I it going to be my side?
Will I like the color? Will it be under 20 dollars?
If all the answer are yes I feel as though I've won
I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I pack for this exciting week here at TED
What do somebody with all these outfit bring with her?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought
I brought seven pair of underpan and that' it
Later I learned that about this same time "Havier and Tavio," we're thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras
They knew that about 75,000 Honduran every year would leave to go to the United States and they wanted to ask what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in under us?
At one point "Havier said Dr Vio what if we took some of our empty land what if we just gave it to an embay give some of the US embay give some of the Canadian embay and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or the rules of the United States they could go get jobs do everything they do on those embay groundy ground that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the US to do?"
In the summer of 2009 Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis
At the next regularly scheduled election PPPA Lobo won in a landlide on a platform that promised reform but reconciliation as well
In 2007 I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development
He asked Archavio to be his chief of staff
Eventually I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal
Microsoft a process of refinement trial and guide a lot of user testing I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bear essential
The first point was the importance of rules like those rules that say you can't come in and strategies all the existing apartment holders
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies but it takes technologies and rules to get progress and it' usually the rules that hold this back
In the fall of 2010 a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk
He showed it to half-year
Our new goal should be that when every family think about where they want to live and work they should be able to choose between at least handful of different cities that we're all competing to attract new residents
They called me
They said "Let' present this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami in a hotel conference room
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are how much more valuable they are than they cost
And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City -- noticed land that' worth thousands of dollars in some cases per square meter
But it was a fairly& discussion and at some point when there was a pause October said "Pol Maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."
(Applause)
So the TED Talk laid out in very simple terms a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in to go live under those rules or not
So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project This is important This could be the way forward for our country
I was asked to come to Tagoa Gallpa and talk again on January 4th and fifth
So I presented another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this which tried to make the point that if you want to create a lot of value in a city it has to be very big
This is a picture of Denver and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver
This airport alone cover more than 100 square kilometers
So as trying to peruade the hundreds if you build a new city you've got to start with a site that' at least a thousand square kilometers
That' more than 250,000 acre
Everybody applauded politely
The face in the audience were very serious and attentive
The leader of the Congress came up on stage and said "Profeor Rumber thank you very much for our lecture but maybe we could watch the TED Talk." (Laughter) I've got it here on my laptop
So I sat down and they played the TEDTound and they played the TEDTound
And it got to the essence which is that a new city could offer new choices for people
There'd be a choice of a city you could go to which could be at Honduras instead of hundreds of miles away in the north
And it also involved new choices for leaders
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now
And the insight of President Lobo was that that asurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get before an investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrut
We went at a site
This picture is from the air
It easily could hold 1,000 square kilometers
And shortly there after on January 19th they voted in the Congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development region
There are billion of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them
In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis the vote in the Congress in favor of this constitutional limit was 1241
All parties all factions in the society back this
To be part of the Constitution you actually have to pass it twice in the Congress
On Bangladesh 17th the past had again with another vote of 114 to one
Immediately after that vote on Bangladesh 24th the delegation of about 30 hunters went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city-building business
One is South Korea
This is a picture of a big new city center that' being built in South Korea bigger than downtown Boston
Everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the permanent
The other place it' very interested in city building is Singapore
They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third
But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it cost to build them
So if you think about this practically here' where we are
They've got to site They're already thinking about this site for the second city
They're putting place a legal system that could allow for manager to come in and also an external legal system
One country has already monitored to let it Supreme Court be the core to final appeal for the new judicial system there
There' designers and builders of cities who are very interested
They even can bring with them some financing
But the one thing you know that they've already solved is that there' lots of tenets
There' lots of businesses that would like to locate in the America especially in a place with a free trade zone and there' lots of people who'd like to go there
Around the world there' 700 million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now
There' a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States
Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job sometimes a single mother who has to go to get enough money and even pay for food or clothing
Sadly sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen in some cases for a decade
So we could easily supply the world with dozen maybe hundreds of new cities
So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand-new city in Honduras
Or to build a dozen of these or a hundred of these around the world
What kind of an idea is that to think about inisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents
This is an idea worth spreading
And my friends from Honduras asked me to say "Thank you TED."
Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities
But just subtitute apartment building for cities
Imagine half of people who wanted to be in apartment already had them the other half aren't there yet
You could try and expand the capacity by doing addition on all the existing apartment
But you know what you've went into as those apartment and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction
So it' extremely hard to do all of those editions
But you could go out some place brand new build a brand new apartment building as long as the rules there were one which facilitated construction rather than getting in the way
So I proposed that government create new reform zone big enough to hold cities and gave them a name charter cities
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insight that can come from different kinds of anatomies particularly when we have people thinking in groups
For years because I've been interested in interect I've also been interested in sex difference research
And one of the things I've been really interested in is looking at the difference between male and female in terms of the way they think and operate in the world
And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that female on average not everyone but on average are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relation and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group
And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have a typical sex so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types
And so if we think about that we have an interesting situation
Year ago when I was a graduate school one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism and considered myself a feminist as I still do asked a really strange question
He said "Tell me what' feminine about feminism."
And I thought "Well that' the dumbest question I've ever heard Feminism is all about undoing stereotype about gender So there' nothing feminine about feminism."
But the more I thought about his question the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism
That is to say there might be something on average different about female brain from male brain that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable
So whereas the father were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state it' possible that if we injected more mother into this concept what we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect but how to care for each other
And maybe that' where we need to go in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy is to think less about the individual body in terms of the identity and think more about those relationships
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union we're thinking about what we do for each other
Thank you Thank you Thank you
And as a general term we can use the term interect for this
This comes in a lot of different form
I'll just give you a few example of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female
So in one instance you can have somebody who has an X-Y chromosome basis and that SRYG on the Y chromosome tell the proto-gone ad which we all have in the fetal life to become testes
So in the fetal life those testes are pumping out testosterone
But because this individual lack receptor to hear that testosterone the body doesn't react to the testosterone
And this is a transmission called adjugent inensitivity transmission
So lots of levels are testosterone but no reaction to it
As a consequence the body develop more along the female typical path
When the child is born she looks like a girl
I want you to imagine two couple in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day at the exact same moment each conceiving a baby OK?
She is a girl She is raised as a girl
And it' often not until she hit puberty and she' growing and developing breast but she' not getting her period that somebody figure out some things up here
And they do some test and figure out that instead of having all reasons inside in a uterus she actually has testes inside and she has a Y chromosome
Now what' important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male but they're really not
Females like male have in our bodies something called the adrena glamour
We're in the back of our body
And the adreatal glance make Androgens which are a maculineizing hormone
Most female like me I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don't actually know my chromosome or makeup but I think I'm probably typical -- most female like me are actually angiogenecensive
We're making entities and we're responding to entrance
The consequence that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more angiogen than the woman born with testies who has engine in sensitivity transmission
So sex is really complicated It' not just that interect people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum in some ways they can be all over the place
Another example a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old who was born a boy raised a boy had a girlfriend had sex with his girlfriend had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had overries and the uterus inside
What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital Adreen Wipe
He had XX chromosome and in the womb his adrena gland were in such high year that it created essentially a maculine hormonal environment
And as a consequence his genital were maculineized his brain was subject to the more typical maculine component of hormone
And he was born looking like a boy Nobody somewhated anything
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from mentruating internally that doctors figured out that in fact he was female internally
So two couple each conceiving one baby
Okay so just one more quick example of a way you can have inner sex
Some people who have sex chromosome develop what are called ovhotusties which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it
Now I don't want you to spend too much time terribly the conception because if you spend all the time terribly that exception you're not going to listen to me so just imagine that for a moment
We're not exactly sure why that happens
So sex can come in lots of different varieties
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it' dwarfism or is can join twinning or it' an interex type -- are often normalized by computation -- is not because it actually leave them better off in terms of physical health
In many cases people are actually perfectly healthy
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social February
Aristotle has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity what it means to be a black person is allegedly to have an African anatomy in terms of your history
And so we have this executive simplistic idea
And when we're faced with a body that actually present us something quite different it startles us in terms of those
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism
And our nation really found it on a very romantic concept of individual
You're going to imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body
Where I ran into the most kind of heat from this most recently was last year when the South African runner Catroomania had her sex called them to question that the abandon Game in Berlin
And in this scenario I want to imagine that in one case this firm is carrying a Y chromosome meeting that X chromosome of the egg
I had a lot of journalist calling me asking me "Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not cash or so many is male or female?"
And I had to explain to the journalist "There isn't such a test."
In fact we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female or between male and interect and female in interect we actually draw that line on nature
So what we have is a sort of situation where the father of science goes the more we have to admit to ourselves that these February that we thought of as stable on atomical February that mapped very simply to stable identity February are a lot more fuzzy than we thought
And it' not just in terms of sex
It' also in terms of race which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed
As we look we get into all sort of rebuild areas
We look for example about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzee
What are we to make of the fact that we're different from them only really by a few nucleus?
And as we get farther and farther with our science we get more and more into a discomported zone where we have to acknowledge that the reinvent February we've had are probably overly simplistic
So we're seeing this in all sort of places in human life
One of the places we're seeing for example in our culture today in the United States today is battle over the beginning of life and the end of life
We have difficult conversation about at what point we decide a body becomes a human such that it has a different right than a fetal life
And in the other case this sperm is carrying an X chromosome meeting the X chromosome of the egg
We have very difficult conversation nowaday probably not out in the open as much as within medicine about the question when somebody' dead
In the past our ancetor never had to struggle so much with his question of when somebody was dead
And most they'd stick a feather on somebody' nose and if a twitch they didn't bury them yet
If it stopped twitching you advertising them
But today we have a situation where we want to take vital organ out of being and give them to other being
And as a consequence we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who' dead and this lead us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple February as we've had before
Now you might think that all this breaking down of February would make somebody like me really happy
I'm a political progressive I defend people with unusual bodies but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous
Both it viable both take off
Undertanding that these February are really much more untable than we thought makes me tense
And it makes me tend from the point of view of thinking about democracy
So in order to tell you about that tenion I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the founding father
I know they were racist I know they were sexes but they were great
I mean they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that aggressive musical 1776 every few years and it' not because of the music which is totally forgetable
We'll come back to these people later
It' because of what happened in 1776 with the founding father
The founding father were from my point of view the original anatomical activist and this is why
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years
So I wear two hat in most of what I do
So as you all recall water-founding father were rejecting was a concept of monarchy and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy
The monarch of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA but they did have a concept of birthright
That is a concept of blue blood
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth
The founder father rejected that idea and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept and that concept was all manner created equal
They loved that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy not the difference in anatomy and that was a really radical thing to do
As the one hat I do history of anatomy
Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an enlightenment system where two things were growing up together
And that was democracy growing up but it was also science growing up at the same time
And certainly clear if you look at the history of the founding father a lot of them were very interested in science and they were interested in the concept of a themselvesistic world
They were moving away from supernatural explanation and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright
I'm in a story and by training and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy meaning human bodies animal bodies how they do it with bodily fluid concept of bodies how they thought about bodies
They were moving towards a themselvesistic concept
And as you look for example in the decoration of independence they talk about nature and nature' God
They don't talk about God and God' nature
They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are
So as part of that they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonal commonality
And in doing so they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Right Movement for the future
They didn't think of it that way but they did it for us and it was great
So what happened? Year afterwards
What happened was women for example who wanted the right to vote took the Founding Father' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to me that we shouldn't have the right to vote the right to full citizenship the right to own property etc the right to own property etc
And women successfully argue that
Next came the successful Civil Right Movement where we found people like Sudhir and Truth you know talking about irony a woman
We find men on the marching lines of the civil rightmen saying "I am a man."
Again people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy again successfully
We see the same thing with the disability right movement
The problem is of course that as we begin to look at all that commonality we have to begin to question why we maintain certain division
To I want to maintain some division and atomically in our culture
For example I don't want to give a fish the same right as a human
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy
I don't want to say five-year-old should be allowed to conent to sex or conent to marry
So there are some anatomical division that make sense to me and that I think we should retain
But the challenge is trying to figure out which one they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning?
So let' go back to those two being conceived at the beginning of this talk
We have two being both conceived in the middle of 1979 in the exact same day
Let' imagine one of the Mary is born three months prematurely so she' born on June 1 first 1980
Henry by contrast is born a term so he is born on March first 1980
Simply by virtue of the fact that Marine was born prematurely three months she comes into all sort of right three months earlier than Henry does the right to conent to sex the right to vote the right to drink
Henry has to wait for all of that not because he' actually any different and age biologically except in terms of when he was born
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist as a patient beneath or I sometimes say as an impatient beneath for people who are patients of doctors
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their right are
Henry by virtue of being assumed to be male although I haven't told you that he' the XY1 by the virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted which Mary does not have to worry about
Mary meanwhile cannot in all the state have the same right that Henry has in all the state namely the right to marry
Henry can marry in every state a woman but Mary can only marry today in a few state or warn
So we have these anatomical February that persist that are in many ways sort of problematic and questionable
And the question to me becomes what do we do as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy that we reach the point when we have to admit that a democracy that' been based on anatomy might start falling apart?
I don't want to give up the science but at the same time it kind of feel sometimes like the science is coming out from under us
So where do we go?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude where we have to draw the line somewhere so we will draw the line somewhere
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position
So for example Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to me that you don't have a white chromosome and what it means to marry woman means you do have a limestone
They don't actually test people for their chromosome
But this is also very bizarre because of the story I told you at the beginning about ancient sensitivity transmission
If we look at one of the founding father of modern democracy Dr Martin Luther King he offer us something of a solution in his eye of a dream speech
In that case what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norm
He says we should judge people based not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character moving beyond anatomy
And I want to say "Yeah that sounds like a really good idea."
But in practice how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of character?
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute right in terms of humans because I have to admit there are some golden retriever that I know that are probably more deserting of social services than some humans I know
I want to also say there are probably also even some yellow laboratory that I know that are more capable of informed intelligent mature decisions about sexual relation than some 40-year-old that I know
So how do we operationalize the question of contentive character?
It turns out to be really difficult
And part of the also wonder what if content of character turns out to be something that' scannable in the future able to be seen with an FIMRI?
Do we really want to go there?
I'm not sure where we go
What I do know is that it seems really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue democracy
So some of what I've worked on for example is people who are can knowing twin two people within one body
We've done a really good job struggling with democracy and I think we would do a good job in the future
We don't have the situation that Iran has for example where a man who sexually attracted to other men is labeled to be shadowed unless he' willing to submit to a sex change in which case he' allowed to live
We don't have that kind of situation
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with a computation I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twin and artist to separate them partly to make a name for himself
But when I was on the phone with him asking why he was going to do this surgery this was a very high-rik surgery his answer was that in his other nation these children were going to be treated very badly and so he had to do this
My response to him was "Well have you considered political asylum instead instead instead of a separation surgery?"
The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are without having them to have to be changed for the sake of a state
So I think we have to be in the lead
Some of what I worked on is people who have dwarfism so people who are much shorter than typical
Well just to close I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the father
And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like or might have looked like if we had more involved the mother
As the iceberg melt it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many form of life
I approach photographing these iceberg as if I'm making portrait of my ancetor knowing that in these individual moment they exist in that way and will never exist that way again
It is not a death when they melt it is not an end but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life
Some of the ice in the iceberg that I photograph is very young a couple thousand years old
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old
As a scientist connection is very important to me
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Kakatawak Greenland
It' a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling
So here it is
You can see on the left side a small boat
It' about a 15-foot boat
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline
You can see here it begin to roll and the boat is moved to the other side and the man is thin either
Microsoft my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected
This is an average size green landic iceberg
It' about 120 feet above the water or 40 meters
And this video is real time
(Applause)
And just like that the iceberg shows you a different side of it personality
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago where I saw my first day
I was in all
My heart beat fast my head was dizzy trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me
The iceberg around me were almost 200 feet out of the water and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake year after year
iceberg are born when they calve off of correspond or break off of ice shell
Each iceberg has it own individual personality
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experience
Some refused to give up and hold on to the bitter end while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion
It' easy to think when you look at an iceberg that they're isolated that they're separate and alone much like we as humans sometimes of aggregate
But the reality is far from it
As an iceberg melt I am breathing in it ancient atmosphere
Well the next day we were in Cleveland
We took a look at her we laughed we cried and we knew that she needed to be in her hopice
We found her one we gathered there and we took care of her and watched over her family because it was necessary
It' something we knew how to do
And just as a woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me she turned into a box of ashe and was placed in my head
You know what I've viewed is right for children and probably America' most widely read children' author in fact
And what had happened was the circle and closed it had become a circle and that epiphany I talked about presented itself
The epiphany is that death is a part of life
She saved my life I and my partner saved herdies
And that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does
It needs truth and beauty and I'm so happy it' been mentioning so much here today
It also needs dignity love and pleasure and it' our job to hand those things out
Thank you Thank you Thank you
And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist
You can have me as a farmer or in leather and no one has ever chose farmer
I'm here today to talk to you about circle and ...
And you know epiphany is usually something you find that you drop some place
You just got to go around a block to see it as an epiphany
That' a painting of a circle
Friend of mine did that Richard Balling broke
It' the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about
My circle began back in the '60 in high school in Stoah where I was the class queer
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the voice room until one teacher saved my life
She saved my life by letting me go to the elsewhere in the boys and the teacher' lounge
She did it in secret
She did it for three years
And I had to get out of town
I had a thumb I had 85 dollars and I ended up in San Francisco California medal lover and back in the '80 found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations
About three or four years ago I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher Mr Poten who said "I need to see you I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adult Could you please come to Oh and please bring that man that I have pancre at a cancer and I should mention that I have pancre at a cancer and I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer And I should mention that I have found by now."
And this is an example of the ways that our wrong government are using technology against us the citizens
And this is one of the main three source of online products today
To look at what' really happening in the early world we can group the attack based on the attackers
We have three main groups
We have one-like criminal
Like here we have Mr Dominary Collaborph from the city of Keith in Ukraine
And the motive of online criminal are very easy to understand
These guys make money
They use online attack to make lots of money and lots and lots of money
We actually have several cases of million years online multi-million years who made money with their attack
Here' what I'm going to check in from Todak Doyna'tonia
This is Africa Zale
This is Stephen Wont
This is Bird Sudhim this is Matthew Anderson Tatig Aldoor and so on and so on
These guys make their fortune online but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojan for still money from our bank account while we do online banking or with keylogger to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer
The US Secret Service two months ago froze the Swiss bank account of Mr Sound Jane right here and that acron had 14 of nine million US dollars on it when it was frozen
Mr Jane himself is under loose Nobody know where he is
And I claim it' already today that it' more likely for any of us to become a victim of a crime online than here in the real world
And it' very obvious that this is only going to get worse
In the future a majority of crime will be happening on one
In the communist eastern Germany if you owned a typewriter you had to register it with the government
The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money
Turbo you've made it by something else motivated by protest motivated by an opponent motivated by the lab
Group like Annalymous have writing up public last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attack
So those are the three main attackers criminal who do it for the money activist like analyt doing it for the protest but then the last for our nation-state -- government doing the attack
And then we look at cases like what happened in digital art
This is a prime example of what happens when government attack against their wrong citizens
Did you know Tar is a certificate authority from the Netherland or actually it was?
It was running the backdrophic last fall because they were hacked into
Somebody broke into they hacked thoroughly
And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representative I asked one of the leaders of a team whether he felt positive that people died because of the digital hack
And his answer was "Yes."
So how do people die as a result of a hack like this?
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter
Well the genotar is a CA
They sell survicate
What do you do with certain victim?
Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has HPTBS SSL Collegeed services so it is like GMM
Now we all are big part of us use email or one of their competitor but these services are especially popular in totalitarian state like Iran where dissident use foreign services like GMA because they know they are more thrut-worthy than the local services and they are Collegeed over ecile connection or the local government can't smoke on their discussion
advertise they can if they hack into a foreign CA an issue rogue certificate
And this is exactly what happened with the case of legitology
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from
What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening for example in Egypt?
Well in Egypt the writer looted the headquarter of the Each of Secret Police in April genuine and when they were loading the building they found lots of paper
Among those paper this binder kind of thin fisher
And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Arab Egypt government a set of tools for intercepting and in very large scale all the communication of the citizens of the country
They had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the Egypt government
The company that border are right here
So Western government are providing totalitarian government with tools to do this against their own citizens
But Western government are doing it to natural as well
If they found the paper which had wrong kinds of thought that could track them who created that thought
For example in Germany just a couple weeks ago they're so called "Start' Trojan was found," which was a trojan used by German government official to investigate their own citizens
If you are a somewhat in a criminal case well it' pretty obvious your phone will be tapped
But today it goes beyond that
They will tap your Internet connection
They will even use tools like start proton to infect your computer with a trojan which enable them to watch all your complication to listen to your online discussion to collect your password
And when me think deeper about things like these the obvious response from people should be that OK well that sounds bad but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen why should I worry because I have nothing to hide?
And this is an argument which doesn't make sense
Privacing is implied
Privacy is not up for discussion
This is not a question between privacy against security
It' a question of freedom against control
And while we might trust our government right now right here in genuine any right we give away will be given away for a good
And we in the West couldn't understand how anybody would do this how much this would risk ricked freedom of speech
And do we trust to be blindly trust any future government a government we might have 50 years from them?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years
We would never do that in our own countries
But today in genuine if you go and by a color laser printer from any major laser-brainter physicianr and print a page that page will end up having slight yellow dock printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer page
This is happening to us today
And nobody seems to be making a fus about
So when I ask you a question since on blind only raise your hands if you want to burn off some calories
Otherwise when I ask you a question and if your answer is "Yes I'd like you to clap your hands."
So for my first question for you today are you guys waiting to hear about the choice overload problem?
Bad to you
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University I used to go to this very very up-scale grocery store at least at that time it was truly up scale
What is it store called rager?
And this store it was almost like going to an amusement park
They had 250 different kinds of mustard and venture girls and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetable and more than two dozen different kinds of bottle water and this is during a time when we actually used to drink tap water
I used to look going to this store but on one occasion I asked myself "Well how can we never buy anything?"
Here' our olive oil ail
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil including those that were in a locked case that came from a thousand-year-old olive trees
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager and I asked the manager "You know is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"
It pointed to the bus load of tort that would show up every day with camera ready usually
We decided to do a little experiment and we picked it jam for our experiment
He missed her jam mile
They had 348 different kinds of jam
We set up a little tasting both right near the entrance of the store
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical?
We either put out six different flavor of jam or 24 different flavor of jam and we looked at two things: first in which case were people more likely to you know stop sample from jam
More people stopped when they were 24 about 60 percent than when there were six about 40 percent
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam
Now we see the opposite effect
Of the people who stopped when they were 24 only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam
Other people who stopped when they were six well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam
Now if you do the map people were at least six times more likely to buy a job jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 27
I recently did a survey for over 2,000 Americans and the average number of choices that the typical American report making is about 70 in a typical day
Now aggressive not to buy a jar of jam is actually probably good for us at least it' good for our waste lines but it turns out that this choice overload problem affect us even in very consequential decisions
We choose not to choose even when it goes against their best self-interest
So now for the top I give today financial saving
This is the study that I did with -- Gore Hope now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Garhumberman Amira Caminica where we looked at the retirement saving decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plants all in the US
And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offering available in a retirement saving plan the 401K plan does that effect people' likelihood to save more for tomorrow?
And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation
So in these plan with about 657 plan that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offering
And what we found was that the more fund offered indeed there was less '90 rate
So if you look at the extreme those plan that offer new two fund '90 rate we're round in the mid-'70 still not as high as we want it to be
In those plan that offer nearly 60 fund '90 rate have now dropped to about 60 percentile
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present even than it has negative consequence
So for those people who did choose to participate the more choices available the more likely people were to completely avoid stock or equity fund
The more choices available the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market account
It was also recently a study done with scream in which they followed scream around for a whole week
Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would work a men for people when you're considering their future financial well-being
Well over the past decade we have observed three main negative consequence to offering people more and more choices
They're more likely to delay aggressive procratinate even when it goes against their best self-interest
They're more likely to make moreest choices more financial choices medical choices
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied even when they do objectively better
The main reason for this is because well we might enjoy gazing at those giant wall of maneze mucard venture girls jam but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple technique -- technique that we have tested in one way or another in different research venue -- that you can easily apply in your businesses
The first cut
You've heard it said before but it' never been more true than today that less is more
These scientists simply documented all the various castes that these scream engaged in and how much time they spent engaging and making decisions related to these task
People are always upset when I say "cut."
They're always where they're going to lose shelf space
But in fact what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to get rid of those extraneous redundant option well there' an increase in sales there' an improvement of the aggressive experience
When Procter and Gamble went from 26 different kinds of head and shoulders to 15 they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent
When the Golden Cant Corporation Dotter did their 10 worst-elling cat litter products they saw an increase in profit by 87 percent a function of both increase in sales and lowering of cost
You know the average grocery store today offer you 45,000 products
The typical Wal-Mart today offer you 100,000 products
But the night the ninth largest retailer the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is all these and it offer you only 1400 products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce
Now in the financial saving world any one of the best example that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offering has actually been something that David Lakeen was heavily involved in design which is the program that they have at Harvard
Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in the life-cycle fund
For those people who actually want to choose they're given 20 fund not 300 or more fund
And they found that the average scream engaged in about 139 task in a week
You know often people say "I don't know how to cut They're all important choices."
The first thing I do is I ask the employees tell me how these choices are different from one another and if your employees can't tell them apart neither can your consumer
Now before we started our session this afternoon I had a chat with dairy
And Garry said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience and all expenses paid three vacation to the most beautiful road in the world
As a disgust of the road
And I'd like to do read it
And now I'll give you a few second to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take dairy up on his offer
(Applause)
And then he was waiting to take him up on his offer
Each task was made up of many many many sub-chise of course
Does that hope?
All right I'm going to show you some more about this
You guys knew there was a trick in you
Now it was ready to go on this trip
(Applause)
(Applause)
I think I might have actually heard more in my hands
All right All right All right All right All right All right All right All right
Now if act you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around
Fifty percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you
Which bring me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem which is surgeon
That in order for people to understand the difference between the choices they have to be able to understand the consequence associated with each choice and that the consequence need to be felt in a vivid sort of way in a very concrete way
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card is oppoed to cash?
Because it doesn't feel like real money
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use and getting people to save more
So the study that I did with Slowly Ben Artey and El-Saaderal Creva Thero we looked at -- we did a study with people at IMG employees that are all working at ING and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time
And during that session we kept this session exactly the way it used to be but we added one little thing
The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more
By doing that simple thing there was an increase in envelopment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people that were willing to save until the amount that they were willing to put down into their saving account by four percent
The third technique: categorization
We can handle war February and we can handle choices
So for example here' the study we gave in a magazine ail
It turns out that in wagon grocery store up and down the northeat corridor the magazine Ill' rage anywhere from 331 different kinds of magazine versus all the way up to 660
It' no like
If I show you 600 magazine and I divide them up into 10 February versus I show you 400 magazine and divide them up into 20 February you believe that I have given you more choice and a better aggressive experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600
Think about your own choices
Because the February tell me had to tell them apart
Here are two different templery display
One is called jazz and the other one is called Swain
If you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz clapper hands
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine-minute category versus your one-hour category?
(Applause)
And it' something
If you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing clap your hands
Take a bit more
You're like "No it turns out you're right."
But what on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing
This is a highly useless categorization scheme
The February need to say something to the chooseer not the choice maker
And you often see that problem when it comes down to that those long list of all these fund
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?
I fourth technique: condition for complexity
It turns out we can't actually handle a lot more information than we think we can we've just got to take it a little easier
We had had a gradually increased the complexity
How well do you think you're doing it managing those choices?
I'm going to show you what example of what I'm talking about
But let' take a very very complicated decision buying a car
Here' a German car physicianr that gives you the opportunity to completely cost them make your car
It makes 60 different decisions completely make up your car
Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision
Car color exterior car color I've got 56 choices
Engent gearship poor choices
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear
So half of the customers are going to go from high choice 56 car color to low choice for gear shift
The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice four gear shift the 56 car color high choice
What am I going to look at?
How engage do you are?
If you keep hitting the thought-button-part decision that means you're getting overwhelmed that means I'm losing you
What you find is the people that go from high choice to low choice they're hitting that the fault button over and over and over again
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern-day aggressive problems that we have which is the choice overload problem
We're losing them too we're losing them and we're losing them too we're losing them too and we're losing them too and we're losing them too and we're losing them too people and people and them too and them too and people and them too and people
They go from low choice to high choice; they're hanging in there
It' the same information It' the same number of choices
The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented
If I start to off easy I learn how to choose
Even though aggressive gear shift doesn't tell me anything about my preference for interior day core it still prepare me for how to choose
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged
So let me recap
I have talked about four technique for mitigating the problem of choice overload: cut get word of the extraneous alternative conquertize make it real categorize -- we can handle more February less choices condition for complexity
All of these technique that I'm currency to you today are designed to help you manage your choices better for you you can use them on yourself better for the people that you are serving
We want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be aggressive about aggressive
And the more we're able to be aggressive about aggressive the better we will be able to practice the art of aggressive
Thank you very much
And as I talk about this problem I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answer
And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases
And I show on Lake Cope Black Art we needed the habit of saying "Here' my worst mistake that would say to everybody from paramedic to the chief of cardiac surgery Here' my workers from the state: "Flob I'll love a blob what about your and I would point the microphone towards them."
And that pupil would dilate and they would play coil then they would look down and storytelling hard and start to tell me their stories
Legion narry as in TED William Fledgeon there in the last majorly baseball player to get over 400 during the regular season
They want to tell their stories They want to share their story
They want to be able to say "Look don't make the same mistake I did."
What they need is an environment to be able to do that
What they mean is a really defined medical culture
And it start with one fortunate at a time
The redefine fortunate is human no she is human except it isn't crowd of making mistake but stride to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else
She share her experience with others
She' supportive when other people talk about their mistake
And she point out other people' mistake not enough got she away but in the loving secure way so that everybody can benefit
And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledge that human being run the system and when human being run the system they will make mistake from time to time
So the system is evolving to create -- perhaps that make it easier to detect those mistake that humans inevitably make -- and also foster in a loving supportive way -- places where everybody who is oberving in the health care system can actually point out things they could be potential mistake and is rewarded for doing so and especially people like me when we do make mistake we're rewarded for doing so and especially people like me when we do make mistake and is rewarded for doing so and especially people like me when we do make potential mistake and is rewarded for coming to be
Now let' take this back into my world of medicine where I'm a lot more comfortable perhaps a bit less comfortable after one I'm going to talk to you about
My name is Brian Goldman
I am a redefine position
I'm human I make mistake
I'm sorry about that but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people
I still don't know much if they give me but I can live with that
And let me close with three words of my home: "I do."
Suppose you have a pen to citus and you refer to a computation with batting 400 on it
(Applause)
Somehow this isn't working out isn't it?
Now supplement you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockage in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refer that loved one to a cardiologist who was batting 200 on angiographies
But but you know what?
She' doing a lot better this year She' on the combat trail
It' 257
Somehow as is a working
But I'm going to ask you a question
I think we have to do something about the culture a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change
What do you think of batting average or a cardiac computation or an Earth' practitioner or an orthopedic computation or an orthopedic computation or an orthopedic computation or an orthopedic computation or an orthopedic computation or an orthopedicist?
Thousand very quickly
Now truth and matter is nobody know in all of medicine what a good computation or a fortunate or paramedic is supposed to back
What we do though is we send each one of them including myself out into the world with the admination be perfect
Never ever ever make a mistake but you worry about the detail about how that' going to happen
And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in men' school
I was obsessed with compulive students
In high school classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study Group blood test
And it start with one fortunate and that' me
And so I did
I studied in my little garret at the nurse' rein of Toronto General arguing not far from here
And I memorize everything
I memorized in my anatomy classic origin in the searches of every muscle every branch of every artery that came off the aorta about differential diagnose obcure and common
I even knew the differential diagnosis and had a classified renovator as a does
And all the while I was a massive war and more gallery
And I did well I graduated with honor Crum Laden
You may be able to get around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false pretige to be able to do that
And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything in new everything or as much as possible as close to everything is possible that it would immunize me against making mistake
And it worked for a while until I met this as Dragon
I was resident in a teaching hospital here in Toronto and this is Dr was brought to the 1990 department at possible where I was working
At the time I was asigned to the cardiology service cardiologic quotation
And it was my job when the 1990 staff called for Cardiology Conult to see that patient in a merge
And to report back to my attendee
And I saw him as his dropper and she was retless
When I listened to her she was making a weasy sound
And then when I listened to her chest for the Stephen Scope I could hear crappy sounds on both side that told me that she was in congeted apart failure
This is a condition in which the heart fail instead of being able to pump all the blood forward some of the blood back up into the lung fill up with blood and that' why you have sugar and bread
Before I actually begin to meet in my talk let' begin with a bit of baseball
And that wasn't the difficult diagnosis to make
I made it and I said to work treating her
I gave her Astrin I gave them license to relate to strain in their car
It gave her license that we call diretic water bill to get her to pee up theocracy fluid
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two she started to build that
And I felt really good
And that' what I made -- my first mistake -- I centered home
Actually I made two more mistake
I sent her home without speaking to my intending
Thank you Why not?
I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do just to call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her might for himself
And he knew he would have been able to furn a citizen information about her
Maybe I did it for a good reason
Maybe I didn't want to be a hymen' residents
When you're the end Britain cost you to the world' ceremony
Maybe I wanted to be so successful as so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my intending patients without even having to contact them
The second state that I made was worse
In sending your home I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me "Goldman not a good anchy don't do this."
In fact so lacking and confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after this is Dr Kerner "Do you think it' OK if she goes home?"
We all love based all that way
And the nurse thought about it and said "Very matter frankly yeah and she'll do OK."
I can remember that like it was yesterday
So I signed that this drug apre and angel came Parliament came and take her home
And I went back to my work on warrior
All the rest of that day that afternoon I had this kind of annoying feeling inside my stunk
(Applause)
But I carry on my work
And at the end of the day I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the park he wanted to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do
I walked through the 1990 department on my way home
Basefall is filled with some amazing statistic
And it was there that another nurse not the nurse who was looking after this dropper before but another nurse said three words to me "That are the three words that most 1990 fortunate I know dread."
Other in medicine dread them as well but there' something particularly about 1990 medicine because we see patients so fleetingly
The three words are "Do you remember?"
Do you remember that patient you've sent home?
And there' hundreds of them
The other nurse asked mentor
The fact being which is bad just that tomor of voice
When she was back I write it
She was back in your death
About an hour after she had ride home after I had center home she collapsed and her family called 911 in the parameter brought her back to the 1990 department where she had a blood pressure of 50 which is in severe shop
And she was barely breathing and she was blue
And ImageNet pulled out all the stop
Money ball are about to come out and it' all about statistic and using statistic to build a great baseball team
They gave them license to raise their blood pressure
They put around a ventilator
And you know I was shocked and shaving to the core
And I went through this rollercoaster because after they stabilized her she went to the intensive care unit and I hoped it is hope that she would recover
And over the next two or three days it was clear that she was never going to wake up
She had a universal brain damage
And the family gathered
And over the course of the next day or nine days they reigned natural to what was happening
And about the nine-day mark they later go "Mis' Drucker a wife a mother and a grandmother."
They say you've never forget the name of those who die
And that was my first time to be equated with that
Over the next few weeks I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exist in our culture of medicine where I felt alone isolated not feeling the health of the shame that you feel because you can't talk about it with your colleagues
I'm going to focus on one step that I hope a lot of you have heard of
You know that healthy kind when you betray a secret that a best friend major promise never to reveal and you get busted and then you have your best friend confront you when you have terrible discussion but at the end of it all that sick feeling error you and you say "You know I'll never make that mistake again."
And you make inhabit and you never make that mistake again
That' the kind of shame that is a teacher
The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside
It is the one that says "Not that what you did was bad but you are bad."
It' called a batting average
And it was what I was feeling
And you know wasn't because of my attending he was at all
He talked to the family and I'm quite sure he smoothed things over in nature that I didn't get suited
And I kept asking myself this question
Why did I ask my attending "Why did I send her call?"
So we talk about a 300-year-old battery That' 300
And then at my worst moment why did I name such a stupid mistake?
Why do they go into medicine? Why don't they go into medicine?
Slowly but surely it lifted
I began to feel a bit densely
And you know on a cloudy day there was a crack in the cloud and the sun started to come out and I wondered you know maybe I could feel better again
And I made myself a bargain that if only I redoubled my effort to be perfect and never make another mistake again please make the voice stop
And they don't care and they don't care and they don't think they don't care and they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't care and they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't think they don't
And I went back to work
And then it happened together again
That means that the ball player batted safely hit safely three times out of 10 at that
Two years later I was in the tending and the 1990 department at a community costume of this northern Torado and I saw 25-year-old man to the South Bronx
It was busy I was in a bit of her writing
A jump point in the air
I looked at this drug with a little bit paper
And I gave away restriction per penicillin and set it on his way
And even as he was walking at the door he was still sort of pointing to his throne
And two days later I came to do my next 1990 shift and that' when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office
And she said "The three words do you remember it."
You remember that patient you saw with the sore throat
Well it turns out he didn't have a threat throat
He has a potentially life-threatening condition called epiground titus
It Google it but it' an infection not of the throat but of the upper hairway and it can actually cause the airline clothes
And you know iPhonely you didn't die
He was placed and introduced antibiotic and he recovered after a few days
And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and fell over cleant and went back to work until it happened again and again and again
That means hit the ball into the outfield drop didn't get caught to whoever tried to throw the first base didn't get there in time and the runner was safe
Twice in one 1990 shift I missed a pendeized
Now that takes some doing (Laughter) Epecially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw about 14 people at night
Now in both cases I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their chair
One I thought I had a kidney stone
I ordered a kid in the X-ray when it turned out to be normal my colleague who was doing a reasesment of the patient noticed in candidate in the right the workwide drinking called the computation
The other one have a lot of diarrhea
I ordered some fluid to rehydrate him and ask my calling to reases him
And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right-known or collagen culp
Both cases they had their operation and they did OK
But it' time they were noisy even at me
And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years of practice many of my colleagues say which is totally yes
Some of my dues have been in the last five years
Alone a shame and unupported
Here' the problem: If I can't come clean and talk about my mistake if I can't find the still small voice to tell someone what really happened how can I share with my colleagues?
Three times elbow 10
How can I teach them of over what I did so that they don't do the same thing?
If I were to walk into a room right now and tell if I have no idea what you think of me
When was the last time you've heard about somebody talk about failure after failure after failure?
Oh yeah you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistake
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleagues and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I'd just told you right now I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really rebuild somebody would crap a joke they'd change the subject and we wouldn't want
Do you know what they call a 300-year-old baby baseball?
And in fact if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my worthy periodic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital believed me I'd have disappear making eye contact with that person
That' the system that we have
It' a complete denial of a state
If a system in wish there are two kinds of position those who make mistake and those who don't those who can handle state deprivation and those who have lousy of con in those who have brain outcome and those who have brain outcome
And it' almost like an immunological reaction like the antibodies begin to attack that person
And we have this idea that if we drive through the people who make mistake out of medicine what will we be left with but a safe system?
But really you know making all start work
But there are two problems with that
In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism I've made a personal study of medical malpractice of medical guide to learn everything I can't from one of the first article I wrote for the Toronto start to my show "lightcope" black arter
And what I've learned is that guide are absolutely ubiquitous
We work in a system where guide happen every day where one in 10 license or either the wrong license given in hospital or at the wrong age where hospital required infection are getting more and more mirror causing habitat and death
Do you know what they call a 400-base ball hitter?
In this country as metadata 24,000 Canadian die at preventable medical guide
In the United States the Institute of Medicine had did it 100,000
In both cases these are rose underestimate because we really aren't fairity about the problem as we should
And here' the thing
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years we can't came up with it
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervaive
We can't get rid of it
We have our cognitive biases so that I could take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain
Now take the same patient with chest pain make the moist and gharial to put a little bit of Manhattan on their breath and suddenly my history is laced with contempt
That' somebody you hit by the way four times say three out of every 10
I don't take the same history
I'm not a robot I don't do things the same way each time
And my patients on cars -- they don't tell me their symptom in the same way each time
Given all of that mistake are exhaust
So if you take the system as I was taught and weed out all the guide crown health professional well there won't be anybody left
And that' basically what I'm going to be talking about
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution right now within the computer by in a few minutes or in the complicated basis of a few hours
At the end of that I end up with program that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers
In fact there are program that are much more efficient than program I had ever written my hand
So if you bring up the light
Now if I look at those program I can't cut you how they work
I tried looking at them and tell you how they worked
They're obcure weird program
If you bring up the light higher because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here
But they do the job
And in fact I know I'm very confident that they did a job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of program that did the job
In fact their life depended on doing the job
I was writing in a 747 with Marvit Menky once and he pulled off his card and said "Oh look look at this," it says "This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe light Because what I'm making a feel confident."
In fact we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets complex
So we're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that' very different than engineering
And it let us produce things of much more oxygen than normal engineering less it' produced
And yet we don't quite understand the option of it
So in itself it' getting a habit
We're now using those program to make much faster computer so that we'll be able to run this process much faster
So it' beating back on itself
The thing is becoming faster -- that' why I think it' seen so confuing
Because all of these technologies are being back on natural
We're taking off
And what we are is at a point in time which is now I guess to win single-cell organism we're running in a multi-olving
So where the amybud and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're created
We're right at that point of transition
Now why do we draw technology curve in some new lawn terms?
But I think that there really is something coming along after us
I think it' very body of us to think that we're the embotic evolution
I think all of us here are in a part of producing whatever that next thing is
So lunch is coming long and I think I will stop at that point where I get selected out
The answer is if I drew it on a normal curve where let' say this is years this is time of some sort and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph the graph looks sort of silly
They sort of go like this
And they don't tell us much
Now if I graph for instance some other technology say transportation technology on a semi-laughter it would look very stupid but it would look like a black line
When something like this happens things are all attainively changing
So transportation technology was moving along as vast as microproceor technology then sort of day after tomorrow I would be able to give in a taxic cabin be in Tokyo in 30 second
It' not moving like that
And there' nothing prosident in the history of technology development of this kind of self-peating growth where you go by order of magnet with every video
Because I usually paint the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along or going to be and I thought that since I was among friends here I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jump and technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on bubble
Now the question that I'd like to ask is if you look at these exponential curve they don't go on forever
Things just kept also linking changing as fast as they are
One of two things is going to happen
Either it' going to turn into sort of classical Aspero like this tell something totally different comes along or maybe it' going to do this
That' about all what you do
Now I'm an optimist so I sort of think it' probably going to do something like that
If so that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transition
We're sort of on this line and the transition from the way that the world used to be to some new way that the world is
And so what I'm trying to ask and I've been asking myself is what' this new way that the world is?
What' the new state that the world is heading toward?
Because the transition seems very very confuing when we're right in the middle of it
Now when I was a kid growing up the future was kind of the year 2000 and people used to talk about what happened in the near 2000
Now here' a conference in which people talk about the future and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000
It' both far as we go out
In other words the future has got to have been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime
Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something' happening there
That transition is happening We can also sense it
And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out 30 50 years because everything is so different that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all
So what I would like to talk about is what that could be what that transition could be that we're going to do
Now in order to do that I'm going to have to talk about it bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers
Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and pick a long time scale look at things
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on at this time scale of life on Earth
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it if you pigeon gear at a time
So if you go back about two and a half billion years the Earth was this big sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemical swording around on it
And if you look at the way that the chemical got organized we begin to get a pretty good idea at how they do it
And I think that there' theory that I'm beginning to understand about how it started with R abstractamp;A but I'm going to tell some simple story of it which is that at that time there were little drop of oil navigating around with all kinds of recipe of chemical that were
And some of those drop of oil had a particular combination of chemical in them which caused them to incorporate chemical from the outside and grow the drop of oil
And those that were like that started to split into bond
Those were the most primitive parm of cells and the sense that little dot are boiled
But now those drop of oil weren't really life as we say it now because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemical
And every time it divided something different we would have sort of unequal the vision of the chemical with them
And so every drop was a little bit different
In fact the drop that were different in the way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemical around them grew more incorporated more chemical and debited more
So those tended to live longer get expressed more
Now that sort of just a very simple chemical form of water but when things got interested was when these drugs learned a trick of&ion
Somehow by the way is that we don't quite understand as a little drop learn to write down information
It led to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA
So in other words they worked out in this sort of mindless evolutionary way a form of writing that led them right down what they were so that that way of writing it down to get cut
The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have state deadly since it evolved two and a half billion years ago
In fact the rest of people us our genes is exactly that thing code in that same way of writing
In fact every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letter in the same code
In fact one of the things that I did just for amusement purpose is we can now write things in this kid
So I'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide
And I've got here a little 100 micro-gram of black powder which I find out to let the security people see at airport
But this has in it what I did as I took this code and the code has standard letter that we've used for symbolizing it and I wrote my business card on the piece of DNA and amplified at 10 to the 22 times
So if anyone would like 100 million copies of my business card I have money for everyone in the room and back every one in the world and it' right here
And then so if you can just turn on the slide that' on
I really been an egotist I would above putting into a virus and released it in the room
So what was the next step?
Writing down the DNA was an interesting still
And then cause these cells took they kept them happy for another billion years
But then there was another really interesting step where things came completely different which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information so that they began to get communities itself
I don't know if you know this but bacteria can actually exchange DNA
That' why for instance antibiotic resistance as impulse
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from the cell and it went around creating it little DNA information but other bacteria and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to the cell because bacteria can communicate
Now what this communication allowed was communities to form but in some sense we're in the same boat together They were synergistic
This is just a random slide that I picked out of my pile
They survived or they failed together which means that the community was very successful all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution
Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close but in fact they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA
And so the next stage that' interesting in life took about another billion more
At that stage we have multicellular communities communities lots of different types of cells working together as a signal
In fact we're such a multicellular community
There are lots of cells that are not outper natural anymore
What I want to show you is not so much of the detail of this live but the general for my mother
Your skin cell is really useless without heart cell muscle cell brain cell so on
So these communities begin to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taken place was no longer cell but a community which we call an organism
Now the next step that happened is within these communities
This communities of cells again began to& information
And they began building very special structure that did nothing but process information with it
Those are the neural structure
So neurons are the information processing embryonic of those communities itself build up
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of risk microproceors versus the power of local area network
In fact they began to get specialists in the community and special structure that were responsible for recording understand the learning information
That was the grain and the nervous system of those communities
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage
Because at that point an individual things learning could happen within the time-pan of a single organism instead of over this evolutionary timescale
So an organism could for instance learn not to use a certain kind of crew because it face bad and it got sick laughed by the data
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism whereas before they had built this special information processing structure but would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off the day they kind of crude
So that nervous system the fact that they're built with special information structure tremendously speeded up the old process of evolution
Because evolution could not happen within individual
It happened in learning times now
And then what happened was the individuals worked out of course trick of communicator
And for example the most sophisticated version we're aware of this human language
It' really a pretty amazing invention to think about it
Here I have a very complicated messy confused idea in my head
I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically hopefully constructing a similar messy confused idea at your head that bear some analogy to it
And the interesting thing about it is that this slide like so many technologies like that we're used to is sort of a straight line on a semilog curve
But we're taking this only very complicated turning it into sound sequence the sounds and producing something very complicated to your brain
So this allows us now to begin to start unchilling as a single organism
And so in fact what we've done is we humanity have started&ing
We're going to do the same levels that most of the cellular organism have gone through abtracting out and that' a recording presenting processing information
So for example in a language was a tiny step in that direction
Reputers videotake CD-ROM so on are all our specialized mechanism that we've now built with in our society we're handling that information
And it all connect us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before
So now evolution can take place on this field
And you saw Kai' little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the commodation program you might Obama your eyes
So now we've speeded up the timescale once again
So the first step in the story that all you about to the billion years of peace
And the next step like light nervous systems and brain took a few hundred million years
The next step like language and so on took less than a million years
And these next step like electronic seems to be taking only a few decades
The process is feeding on itself and we're coming against auto-camletting it' worth working and something contaminat it rate of change
The more it changes the faster it check
I think that that' what we're seeing in this explosion of curve
We're seeing this process beating back when it' self
Now I designed computers for a living and I know that mechanism that I is to design computers would be impossible without recent advance in computer
In other words every step here represent an order of pharmaceutical in performance kids
So right now when I do as I design objects that' such complexity that it' really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense
I don't know what every transistor in the connection should does
And there are billion of them
Instead put I do and what the designers at thinking machines do if we think at some level of&ion and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond but we could ever do much rather than user than what we could ever do
In fact sometimes it takes it by method that we don't part even understand
One method is particularly interesting that I've been using a lot lately is evolution itself
So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale
So for example in the most extreme cases we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequence of instruction
And we're sort of the -- this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semilog curve
So your computer would you please make 100 million random sequence of instructions now would you please run all of those random sequence and structure run all of those program and pick out the one that came closet to do what I wanted?
In other words I define what I want to find
Let' say I went to sort numbers It' a simple example I've got
So find the program that come as a society numbers
So of course random sequence and instructions are very unlikely that sort numbers so none of them will really do it
But one upper bike lock may put two numbers in the right order
I say the computer would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequence that did the best job save those kill off the rest and now let' reproduce the one that sort of numbers the best and let' reproduce them by a process of recombination and now it gets to sex?
Take two program and they produce children by exchanging their sub-routine and the children and the trait the subverteate of the two bulgar
Something really where it is going on here
So I've got now a new generation of program that have produced by hominations of the program that didn't want to get our job
So please repeat that process
Score them again
Introdice mutation per house
And try that again and do that for another generation
Well every one of those generation just takes with you millisecond
For us where we lead a brief moment to think to figure out the trick
So it' more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really
But what' the trick that makes it look realistic?
I it something about the detail or the color?
You see something about the light
What create the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is deluion
But Indian it goes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface
It' not really what is realistic it' how we think looks realistic really
So I think the basic are quite simple
I just see it as a puzzle of reality or I just can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create an old-net reality
And let me show you a simple example
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects -- something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world
I'm here to share my photography
But combined in a certain way they can create something that see looks three-dimensional like it could exist
But at the same time we know it can't
So we trick our brain because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense
And I see the same process with combining forward
It' just really about combining different realities
So the things that make the photograph look realistic I think it' the things that we don't even think about the things all around us in our daily lives
Or is it photography?
But when combining forest this is really important to consider because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result
As you can see these images aren't really special
Because of course this is a photograph that you can take with your camera
But combined they can create something like this
So the first rule is that photo combined should have the same perspective
Secondly forest combined should have the same type of light
And these two images both who feel these two requirement shock at the same height and in the same type of light
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different didn't just begin an end by making it seamless
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed
So by matching color contrast and brightness in the border between the different images adding photographic defect like depth of field deidorated color and noise and make it look like one single image despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds or layer basically
Yet my interesting photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15
So here' another example
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what' manipulated
But this image is actually entirely composed of photograph from different location
I personally think that it' easier to actually create a place and to find a place because then you don't need a compromise with your ideas in your head
But it does require a lot of planning
And getting this idea during winter I knew that I had several months to planet to find the different location for the pieces for the fossil basically
So for example the fish is captured on a fishing trip
The shore are from a different location
On the water part is captured in stone pit
And yeah even turning the house on top of the island red was to make it look more sweetish
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing but it was a bit different because using the camera the process was on the planning instead
So to achieve a realistic result I think it comes down to planning
It always start with a sketch an idea
Then it' about combining the different photograph
And here every piece is very well-planned
And if you do a good job catching the photo the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic
So all the tools are out there and the only thing that limit us is our imagination
Thank you Thank you Thank you
And when you take a photograph with a camera it' just the process end when you press the escape
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place at the right time
I felt like anyone could do that
So I wanted to create something different something where the process start when you press the escape
Photo like this construction going on along a beaster road
But it has an unexpected twist
And despite that it retain the level really
Or photo like this both dark and colorful but all with a common goal of retaining the level of relie
When I say "realist," I mean "Forder."
Because of course it' not something you can't capture it really but I always wanted to look like it could have been captured somewhere as a photograph
But that' the nicet thing that could happen since this is beer pressure
Pierre pressure used to help patients since this could be used for business it could be used to stop Earth' multiface
But on the other hand they also could be used to get people from out of their chair and try to work together It is some kind of gaming activity to get more control of the health
If next week it will be soon available there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an manufacture or something other
And people will be able from their home to take their blood pressure send it into their doctor and eventually share it to others for instance for over 100 dollars
And this is the point where patients get into position and can't collect not only their own control again be capturing of their own chip but also can help us in health care to the challenges that we're faced like healthcare cost explosion double demand and things like that make technique that' easier to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team
I would like to talk to you about why many E of projects fail
And you could do this with technique like this but also by crowdsource
And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video
And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stop listening to patients
And one of the things we did at Robert University is we appointed achieved listening officer
We may be if you got it in our cell phone
We perfectly know where all the ADM are just about the city of mustard
The other thing is we know where all the gas station are
And sure we could find fast food chain
But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient?
We asked around them "Nobody knew."
Nobody know where the nearest life-aving aidy was to a change right now
So what we did we crowdsourced the Netherland
And we set up a website and asked the ground if you see an 80 please submit it tell us where it is tell us when it' open since sometimes in office hours it' close of course
And over 10,000 80 in the Netherland already I've been submitted
The next step we took was find the application for it
And we build an matrix application
We made an application for layer of augmented reality to find these ALS
Not on a very scientific way she put up a little cup of coffee or a cup of tea and asked patients family and relative "What' up? How could we help you?"
And whenever you were in a city like Mutrich and somebody collapse you can use your manufacture and within the next week also around your descend' cell phone to find the nearest AD which can save lives
And as of today we will like to introduce this not only as AED for you which is the product called but also AD for us
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level
And asking all colleagues of us in the rest of the world colleagues universities to help us to find and work and act like a hop to crowdsource all these AED around the world that whenever you are in a holiday and somebody collapse might have made your own relative or someone just in front of you you could find this
The other thing we'd like to ask is companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AED
This might be curious services or cable guys for instance just to see whether the AD that submitted still is in place
So please help us on this one and try to make not only help a little bit better but take control of it
Thank you Thank you Thank you
And we think we like to think that this is one of the major problems why all maybe not all but most of the EO projects fill since we stop listening
This is my wage skill
It' a very simple thing It' got one note on off
And every morning I help on it
And yes I got a challenge as you might see
And I put my challenge on 95 kilogram
But the thing is that it' made this simple that whenever I help on it send my data to Google Health as well
And it' collected by my general petitioner as well so he can see what my problem in weight not on the very moment that I need cardiologic supporters in something like it but also looking back for it
But there' another thing
As some of you might know I got more than 4,000 follow on Twitter
So every morning I hope on my way to kill and before I mean my car people talk to me I think you need a light lunch to the ocean
It stopped us from being inspired
And so I jumped in I jumped into this wall of technology to see how I could use it to enable magic as oppoed to kill it
I've been illustrating books since I was 16
And so when I saw YIPA I saw it as a pedestrian device that could connect readers all over the world
It could know how we're holding it
It can know where we are
It bring together image and text and animation and sound and touch
Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-ensorial
But what are we doing with it?
So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Korea an interactive app for the iPad
So it says "Please your finger upon each light."
And so -- and so --
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Camille Mart Philipnez It' so I type in my name
My story begin right here actually in Rajathan about two years ago
And actually become a character in the book
At various point a little letter drop down to me and the iPad know where you live because of routine it' actually addressed to me
The child in me is released hated by these kinds of possibilities
Now I've been talking a lot about magic
And I don't mean desert and dragon I mean the kind of childhood magic those ideas that we all Harvard as children
This idea of fireflie in a job for some reason was always really exciting to me
I was in the desert under the starry skies with this Sufi singer Mutiraly
And so over here you need to tilt your eye back take the fireflie out
And they actually illuminate through the vessel
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single model
And so here each book and each world becomes into a little model that I drag in this magical device within the device
And it open up a map
All along all scientific have always had map but these map have been static
This is a map that grow and glow and becomes your calculateion for the rest of the book
It reveal itself to you at certain point in the book as well
So I'm going to turn in
And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epictor Mahabal
Another thing that' actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary
Oh here these are the absolute
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about name but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterpart the absolute
These all-oburd have been trapped inside Indra' chamber for thousands of years in a wool in Maiero
And so we're bringing them back in acute country so refrigerator
And a story that actually deal with new issues like the Environmental Vice
Speaking of the environmental crisis I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their room glued to their bees they haven't been able to get out
So back in the day when as Indian wanted to travel we jump into our chariot and we zoom across the sky
But now with mobile technology we can actually take our children outside into the themselves world with their technology
One of the interaction in the book is that you're sent off on this quet where you need to go outside take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different themselves objects
When I was a child I had multiple collection of stick and stone and pebble and shell
And so now kids don't do that anymore
So in bringing back this child you'll ritual you need to go out and in one chapter take a picture of a flower and then tag it
In another chapter you need to take a picture of a piece of box and then tag that
And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photograph that you can then put up online
A child in London put up a picture of a fox and says "Oh I saw folks today."
A child in India says "I saw a monkey today."
And it create this kind of social network around a collection of digital photograph that you actually take in
Now we do the same with arrow plan
In terms of -- in the possibilities of linking together magic the Earth and technology -- there are multiple possibilities
In the next book we plan on having an interaction where you take your matrix out with the video on and through a mental reality you see this little animated pixies appear on a house plant that' outside your house
At one point your screen is filled up with leave
And so you need to make the sound of wind and glow them away and read the rest of the book
We're moving we're all moving here to a world where the force of nature come closer together to technology and magic and technology can come closer together
Back then when Arduino the great Indian warrior print when he was Herty he'd take out a boat he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out
We're harnessing energy from the sun
We're bringing our children and ourselves closer to the national world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
Now we do the same with drill and machines
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery
And this made me really sad
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobic
I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset without having my camera on me without tweeting it to my friends
And it felt like technology should enable magic not kill it when --
When I was a little girl my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch
And this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me
It became a guilded gateway into a world full of pirate and shipwreck and images in my imagination
So I felt like our cell phone and our fancy watches and our camera had stopped us from dreaming
My grandmother never let me forget his life
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain and my lesson was to learn that yes history tried to crush us but we endured
The next piece of the jigaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea
My mother my mother was 18 when her father died already in an arranged marriage already with two small girls
For her life had distilled itself into one task: the trigger of her family and a new life in Australia
It was inconceivable to her that she would not phenomenon
So after a four years ago that defies fiction a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel
All the adult knew the risk
The greatest fear was of pirate rape and death
Like most adult on the boat my mother carried a small bottle of poison
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bond of women over three generation about how the facility strength of those bond took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl how did with her young sister her mother and her grandmother for five days and night in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago?
If we were captured first to my sister and I then she and my grandmother would drink
My first memories are from the boat the steady beat of the engine the bow dipping into each wave the vast and empty horizon
I don't remember the pirate who came many times but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours
But I do remember the light on the oil rig off the Malayian coast and the young man who collapsed and died the journey' end too much for him and the first Apple I tasted given to me by the men on the wheel
No apple has ever tasted the same
After three months in a refugee camp we landed in Melbourne
And the next piece of the chickaw is about four women across three generation shaping a new life together
We said "Oh Denfort' gray a working-class suburb whose overwhelming is layer of immigrant."
Unlike the settled middle class Sabo his existence I was oblivious of there was no sense of entitlement in Food' gray
The smell from shop door were from the rest of the world
And the snippet of Holton English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again
My mother worked on farm then on a chera-embly line working six days double shoes
Somehow she found time to study English and gain eye-take holification
We were poor
All the dollars who were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what misdile which was usually new clothes they were always second-hand
Two pair of stocking for school each to hide the hole in the other
A school uniform down to the ankles because it had to last for six years
And they were reared with searing chance of slid-eye and the occasional graffiti Asian go home
Go home to wear
Something' different inside me
There was a gathering of symmetry and a quiet voice saying "I will bypa you."
My mother my sister and I slipped in the same bed
My mother was contributioned age-night but we told one another about our day and listened to the movement of my grandma that around the house
My mother suffered from nightmare all about the boat
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmare' team so I could wake her
She opened a computer store then studied to be a petition and opened another business
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition angry and inflexible and disappeard children caught between two will
Grant and sponsor were sought
Senters who are established
I lived in parallel world
In one I was the classic Asian student relentless into demand I made on myself
In the other I was admied in lives that were precarious tragically scod by violence drug abuse and isolation
But so many over the years were helped
And for that work when I was a final year-old student I was chosen as the young Australian of the year
And it was catapulted from one piece of the geek not to another and their edge didn't fit
Tomly Anonymous Foot' Great Resident was now tarmly refugee and social activist invited to speak inventors she'd never heard of and into home whose existence she could never have imagined
Once it took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today
I didn't know the protocol
I didn't know how to use the cottonary
I didn't know how to talk about why
I didn't know how to talk about anything
I wanted to retreat to the synthetic and comfort of life in an unung suburb a grandmother a mother and two daughter ending each day as they had for almost 20 years telling one another the story of their day and falling neuroscientist the three of us still in the same bed
I told my mother "I couldn't do it."
She reminded me that I was now the same A she had been when we bored at the boat
No had never been an option
Just do what she said and don't be what she' not
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchied
The more candidly I spoke the more I was asked to speak
I met people from all walk of life so many of them doing the thing they loved living on the frontier of possibility
And even though I finished my degree I realized I could not settle into a career in law
There had to be another piece of the jigaw
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider a recent arrival new on the scene and not just OK but something to be thankful for perhaps a gift from the boat
Because being in the insider can so easily mean collaping the horizon can so easily mean accepting the preumption of your province
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that yes the world does fall apart but not in the way that you fear
This is not a finished story
Poibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged
There was an energy there an implacable optimism a strange mixture of humility and daring
So I followed my unche
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label "It can't be done with an irreistible challenge."
It is a gigule puzzle still being put together
For a year we were penniless
At the end of each day I made a huge part of soup which we all shared
We worked well into Asia and I
Most of our ideas were crazy but a few were brilliant and we broke through
I made the decision to move to the US after only one trip
My hunches again
Three months later I had relocated and the adventure has continued
"Before I close though and let me tell you about my grandmother."
She grew up at a time when confuionism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered
Let me tell you about some of the pieces
Life had a change for centuries
Her father died soon after she was born
Her mother raised her alone
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her
With no support from her husband she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case and a far greater sensation when she won
(Applause)
It can't be done with showing to be wrong
Imagine the first piece a man burning his life' work
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Melbourne
I looked through the shallow screen and sawy as standing on the other side
I knew she had come to say goodbye
My mother phoned minutes later
A few days later we went to a Buddhist temporary in Food' Gray and sat around her caket
We told her stories and asured her that we were still with her
At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the caket
My mother asked us to feel her hand
She asked the monk "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?"
Because you have been holding it since this morning he said
He is a poet a playwright a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country' unity and freedom
You have not let it go
If there is a sinu in our family it run through the women
Given who we were and how life had shaped us we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives would afford us
Defeat would have come too easily
Now I would like to have my own children and I wonder about the boat
Who could ever wish it on their own?
Yet I am afraid of privilege of AIDS of entitlement
Can I give them a bowl in their lives to pin bravely into each wave the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine the vast horizon that parenthe nothing?
I don't know anyway but I don't know anyway
But if I could give it and still see them safely through I would
OK
And also comes motherly here today in the fourth of all
Imagine him as the Hospitalists enter Sigan confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste
Word for so long his friends now mot him
He retrated into silence
He died broken by history
He is my grandfather
I never knew him in real life
But our lives are much more than our memories
Because that' what you do when your name is your symmetry mountain bear
And he had posted lots of nature video in fact
And this video -- it actually has been posted all the way back in January
So what happened here?
Jimmy came up actually
Jimmy came up posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it had become
Because taste makers like Jimmy Kimal introduced us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience
Rebegger Black' Friday is one of those popular Venus of the year
Hi Kevinal Acca on the Tren Manager YouTube and I professionally watch you two video
It' been seen nearly 200 million times the share
This is a chart of what it looked like
And similar to double rambo it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere
So what happened on this day?
Well it was a Friday It was true
And if you're wondering about those other spike those are also Friday
But what about this day this one particular Friday?
Well Tosh Brynnnnow pictured up a lot of blog started writing about it
Michael Jane Nelson for mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter
But what' important is that an individual or a group of taste makers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience accelerating the process
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it
And now there are 10,000 parodies of Friday on YouTube
Even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week
It' real
Unlike the one-way reputation of the 20th century this community '90 is how we become a part of the succeed either by spreading it or doing something new with it
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how video go viral and then why that even matter
(Applause)
So the ant cat is a looped animation with loop music
It' this just like this
It' been viewed nearly 50 million times this year
And if you think that that is weird you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that' been viewed four million times
Even cat were watching this video
Cat were watching other cat watch this video
But what' important here what' important here is the creativity that it inspired amongt this techie geeky Internet culture
There were remixes
We all want to be stars celebrities singers comedian and when I was younger that seemed so very very hard to do
Someone made an old tiny version
And then I went international
(Applause)
An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we could all actually be a part of
Because we don't just enjoy now we participate
And who could have predicted any of this?
You've got to predict a double rainbow or rebecca black or ant cat
What script could you have written that would have contained this in it?
In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle find in New York City I admit I wasn't very interested
I'm going to take you and we're not right here the bike lane but all the neurotruction that keep you from probably riding in the bike lane
But now web video is made as so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world' culture
(Applause)
Being totally surprising in Umorous Caey Knighttat got his funny idea and point seen five million times
And so this approach hold for anything new that we do creatively
And so it all bring us to one big question
Me awe (Laughter) What does a mean?
taste taste
makers makers makers makers
Creative participating communities complete unexpectedness these are characteristic of a new kind of media in a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience define the popularity
I mean as mentioned earlier one of the biggest stars in the world right now just in beaver got his start on YouTube
No one has to greenlight your idea
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture
And these are not characteristic of old media and they're barely true of the media today but they will define the reputation of the future
Thank you
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute
And of that only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets ton of use and becomes a cultural moment
So how does it happen?
Three things: taste makers communities of '90 and there
I'll tell you I'll tell you
I don't know what it is
A year bare vaska is posted this video that you had shot outside his home in your 70 national park
In 2010 it was viewed 23 million times
This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video bear
He just wanted to share a rambo
It' no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse
But perhaps that' not the case
Perhaps instead it' the distortions brought to us of what' really going on
Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of force are in fact accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance
Now I'm not saying we don't have our set of problems -- climate crisis species extinction water and energy shortage -- we surely do
And as humans we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance but ultimately we disagree them down
So let' look at what this last century has been to see where we're going
Over the last hundred years the average human lifepan has more than doubled average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled
fabric Good mortality has come down a factor of 10
Ad to that the cost of food electricity transportation communication have dropped 10 to 1,000 fold
Yet threat in the wake of bin Laden they have spike
Steve Pinker has showed us that in fact we're living doing the most peaceful time ever in human history
In fabric Kennedy that global literacy has gone from 25 percent over 80 percent in the last 130 years
We truly are living in an extraordinary time
And many people forget this
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher
In fact we redefine what poverty means
Bambin in Somalia police hepper grow
Think of this in America today the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity water toilet refrigerator television mobile phone air conditioning in cars
The wealthiest robber bearing of the last century the emperors on this planet have never dreamed of such luxuries
Underpinning much of this is technology and of late exponentially growing technologies
This is Cartel' called the Crease Live
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jump on this curve on Moore' Law and experience price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months
That' why the cell phone in your pocket is literally a million times cheap in a thousand times fashion the supercomputer of the swallow
Societal decay 65 dead
Now look at this curve
This is Moore' Law over the last 100 years
I want you to notice two things from this curve
Number one how smooth it is through good time and bad time wartime and peacetime receion depression and boom-time
This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers
So Navy wanted cyberattack drug warma to structure tornado receion differations
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges
And also even though it' plotted on the law curve on the left it' curving upward
The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster
And on this curve riding on Moore' Law are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us
Cloud computing what my friends at Autodek Hall infinite computing sensor and network robotic 3D printing which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet: GPS biology fuelé and food digital medicine nanomaterial in air
I mean how many of you saw the winning of "Jeopardy" by IBM' Watson?
I mean that was epic
In fact I scoured the headline looking for the best headline in these paper I could
And I love this: Wob and vanquishes human opponent
It' not an easy game
It' about the nuance of human language
And imagine if you would AI like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell phone
Death disaster
Four years ago here at TED Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University
And we teach our students all of these technologies in particular how they can be used to solve humanity' grand challenges
And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade
(Applause)
Think about that The fact that literally a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today
So those just a few of the clip I collected over the last six months could have easily been in the last six days or the last six years
Thirty years ago that would have send a ludicrist
Today we can point at dozen of companies that have done just that
When I think about it so when I think about creating abundance it' not about creating a life of luxury for blindness planet it' about creating a life of possibility
It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant
You see scarcity is contextual and technology is a resource liberating force
Let me give you an example
So this is a story of Napoleon the third in the mid-1800
He' the dude on the left
He invited over to dinner the king of Siam
All of Napoleon' troop were fed with silver utensil Nepali himself with gold Utensal
But the king of Sam he was fed with aluminum utensil
You see aluminum was the most viable metal on the planet worth more than gold and platinum
It' the reason that the tip of the Washington monument is made of aluminum
You see even though aluminum is 83 percent of the Earth by mass it doesn't come to pure metal
It' all bound by oxygen and silhole
But then a technology about trolleyes came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throwaway mentality
The point is that the news media preferentially feed us negative stories because that' what our mind pay attention to
So let' project this analogy going forward
We think about energy scarcity
Ladies and gentlemen we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year
Sixteen tarwatt of energy hit the Earth' surface every 88 minutes
It' not about being scarce; it' about accessibility
And there' good news here
For the first time this year the cost of solar-generate electricity is 50 percent of dieel-generate electricity in India 88 rupee versus 17
The cost of solar drop 50 percent last year
Last month MIT put out a study showing up on the end of this decade in the sunny parts the United States soil trees would be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average
And if we have abundant energy we also have abundant water
Now we talk about water war
Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth in 1999 the average passed Saturn?
He took a famous photo what was it called?
A pale blue dot a pale blue dot
Because we live on a water planet
We live on the planet 70 percent covered by water
Yes 975 percent is sought water two percent is ice and we fight over half a percent of the water on this planet but here are two there is hope
And there' a very good reason for that
And there is technology coming online not 10 20 years now right now
There' nanotechnology coming on nanomaterial
The conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning one of the great DIY innovator I'd like to share with you he gave me permission to do so his technology called Slinghot and many of you may have heard of it' the size of a small dorm room refrigerator
Every second of every day our sense bring in way too much data that we can possibly process in our brain
It' able to generate a thousand leaders of clean drinking water a day out of any source saw water polluted water latrine at less than two cents a leader
The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of unit of this in the developing world
And if that pan out which if every conference it will Coca-Cola will Obama this globally to 26 countries around the planet
This is the kind of innovation empowered by this technology that exist today
And we've seen this in cell phone
My goodness we're going to hit 70 percent penetration of cell phone in the developing world by the end of 2013
Think about it that a Maai warrior on a cell phone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile common President Reagan did 25 years ago
And if they're on a smartphone on Google they could access more knowledge and information and present Clinton did 15 years ago
And because nothing is more important to us than survival the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted
Better than that the things that you and I spent ten and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- routine HD video and still images libraries of books and music medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally de-materializing and de-monitizing into your cell phone
Probably the best part of it is what' coming down the pike in health
Last month I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcom Foundation something called "10 million-dollar qualcom Try Quotter Exprise."
We're challenging team around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to because it' got AI you can cough on it you can do a finger-blood trick
And to win in these people to diagnose you better than a team of board certified doctors
So literally imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors 25 percent of the disease burn in 13 percent of the health care workers
When this device sequence an convenient DNA virus that it doesn't recognize it call the CDC and prevent the pandemic from happening in the first place
But here here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance
I call it the rising billion
So the white lines here are population
We just passed to seven billion mark on Earth
And by the way the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy
Now migula is our early-warning detector our dangerous detector
In 2010 we had just sort of two billion people online connected
By 2020 that' going from two billion to five billion Internet users
Three billion new mind who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation
What will these people want?
Well they consume what they desire
And rather than having economic shutdown we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever
These people represent ten of trillion of dollars injected into the global economy
And they will get healthier by using a triporter and they'll become better educated by using the economy and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing more productive than ever before
It sort and scour through all of the information looking for anything the environment that might harm us
So what could three billion rising health the educated and productive members of humanity bring to us?
How about a set of voice they've never been heard from before?
What about giving the Considered wherever they might be the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever?
Well these three billion people bring
What about comparison we can't even predict?
The one thing I've learned at the exprise is that small team driven by their passion with a clearer focus can do extraordinary things -- things that large corporation and government could only do in the past
Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited
There is a program that some of you might have heard of
It' a game called "Starface."
It came out of the University of Washington and Seattle
And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acid and figure out how the protein is going to fold
So given the dozen new stories we will preferentially look at the negative news
And how it fold dictate it structure and it functionality
It' very important for research and medicine
And up until now it' been a super-computer problem
And this game has been played by university professor and so forth
And it' literally hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it
And it showed that in fact today the human pan-recognition machinery is better folding protein in the best computers
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world -- it wasn't in my tea professor -- it was a person from England from Manchester -- a woman who during the day was an imagining asistant at a rehab clinic and at night was the world' best protein folder
Ladies and gentlemen what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet
And that old newspaper saying if it believe it lead it' very true
We have the tools with this exponential technology
We have the passion of the DI Innovator
We have the capital of the technical philanthropist
And we have three billion new mind coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges to do that which we must do
We are living into an extraordinary decades ahead
Thank you
So given all of our digital device that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week 24 hours a day it' no wonder that we're peimistic
Ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat the rich and the powerful and the privilege but by how they treat the poor the condemned the incarcerated
Because it' in that axis that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are
I sometimes be that of ballot I sometimes be that of ballot
I'll end with this story I'll end with this story I'll end with this story
I sometimes push too hard I do get tired as we all do
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of are kind of thinking in ways that are important
(Applause)
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840
And I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to these very harsh sentence
And I go to the jail and I see my client who' 13 and 14 and he' been certified to stand tallers in the dark
I keep start thinking "Well how did that happen?"
How can a judge turn you into something that you're not?
And the judge certified him as an adult but I see this kid
And I was up to late one night and I started thinking "Well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power."
Here Brian the judge has some magic power
You should ask for some of that
She was born in the 1880 and experienced slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world
And because I was up too late and wasn't thinking real street I started working on emotion
And a client was 14 years old a young poor black kid
And I started working on this motion within the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor 14-year-old black male client like a privileged white 75-year-old corporate imagining
And I put in my motion that there were propectoral misconduct and police misconduct and judicion was hunted
It was a crazy line in there about how there' no conduct in this candy it' all in misconduct
And the next morning I woke up and I thought "No did I dream that crazy motion or did I actually write it?"
And to my horror not only had I written it but I had sent it to court
A couple months went by and I just had forgotten all about it
And finally I decided "Oh guys I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case."
And I got in my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse
I was saying "No what this is going to be so difficult so painful."
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse
And as I was walking up the step of this courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse
My grandmother was tough which was also loving
When this man saw me he came over to me and he said "Who are you?"
I said "I'm a lawyer," he said "You're a lawyer," I said "Yes sir."
And this man came over to me and he hugged me
And he Hawaiied in my ear
He said "I'm so proud of you."
And I have to tell you it was energizing
It connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community to perspective that is hopeful
When I would see her as a little boy she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hug
Well I went into the court
And soon as I walked inside the judge saw me coming
He said "Mr Stephen did you write this crazy motion?"
I said "Yes sir I did We started counsel."
People started coming in because they were just outrage I had written these crazy things
And please officers were coming in system prosecutes and clerk workers
We're foreign with what most filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality
And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go
And out of the corner of my eye I can see this janitor pacing back and forth
It kept looking through the window and you could hear all of this hotter
And he kept peasing back and forth and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost a countal table
Ten years later the judge had we would take a break
During the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court
And this stuff he jumped up and he ran over to this older black man
He said "Jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom?"
And the older black men stood up and he looked at that deputy and he said "I came into this court room To tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral lack of the universe is long but it bend toward justice That we cannot be full evolved human being until we care about human right and basic nictity that all of our justice that we cannot be full evolved human being toward justice That we care about human right toward justice That we cannot behold human right toward justice That we cannot bend toward justice That we cannot be full evolve human right toward justice that we care about human right toward justice that we care about human right toward justice that we care about human right toward justice
In an hour too later if I saw her she'd come over to me and she'd try and do you still feel me hunging you
And more than anything for those of you who share that I've simply come to tell you that to keep your eyes all the prize hold all
Thank you very much
Hi that' right
CA: So you heard and so on obvious desire by this audience this community to help you on your way and to do something on this issue
If I said "No she'd have sought me again and I'd say "Yeah she'd leave me alone."
Other than writing a check what could we do?
Well there are opportunities all around us
If you live in the state of California for example there is a referendum coming up this spring where actually there' going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment
For example here in California we spend we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars
And yet 46 percent of all homicide cases don't symmetry on arrest -- 56 percent of all rate cases don't symmetry
So there' an opportunity to change that
And then she just had this quality she always wanted to be near her
This referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety
And I think that opportunity exist all around us
There' been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades
And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it' about increased incarceration rate
What would you say to someone you believe that?
Well actually the violent crime rate is remain relatively stable
The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime February
It was this misguided war on drugs
That' where the dramatic increase have come in our prison population
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment
And so we have three strike law that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low-level property crime rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimize
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime not do less
And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one
And I think that' the orientation that we have to change
My mom was the youngest upper 10 kids
Chris Anderson: Brian you struck a massive chord here
You're an inpiring person
Thank you so much for coming to TED Thank you
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her it would be difficult to get her time and attention
My cousin would be running around everywhere
And I remember when I was about eight or nine years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousin were running around
And my grandmother was seeing across their room staring at me
And at first I thought we were playing a game
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me
And I would look at her and I'd smell but she was very serious
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said "Come on Brian you're not going to have a talk."
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday
And never will forget it
She took me out back and she said "Brian I'm going to tell you something which you don't tell anybody what I tell you."
She said "No you make sure you don't do that."
I said "Sure."
Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said "I want you to know I have been watching you."
I spent most of my time in jail in prison on death row
And she said "I think you're special."
She said "I think you can do anything you want to do."
I will never forget it
Then she said "I just need you to promise me three things right."
I said "OK Mom."
She said "The first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom."
She said "That' my baby girl and after promise manal you'll always take care for her."
Well I adored my mom so I said "Yes mama I'll do that."
Then she said "The second thing I want you to promise me is that she'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing."
I spent most of my time in very low-income communities and the projects in places where there' a great deal of hopelessness
And I thought about it and I said "Yes mama I'll do that."
Then found she said "The third thing I want you to promise me is that she'll never drink Manhattan."
Well I was nine years old I said "Yes Mom I'll do that."
A group in the country in the rural South and have a brother-year older than me and a sister you're younger
When I was about 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of bureau and where he got it
He grabbed me in my system we went out in the wood and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazyly did and he had to sip with the spear and he gave them to my sister and she had something They offered it to me
I said "No no no no that' okay y'all I'm not going to have."
My father said "Mom we're doing this today You always do what we do I had some your sister and have some beer."
He said "No I don't feel right about that you'll go ahead."
And then my brother started staring at and he said "What' wrong with you have some beer?"
Then he looked at me real hard and he said "Oh I helped you not still hung up on that conversation Mommy hair with you."
These are the momental all the grain kids that they're special
(Applause)
I was devastated
And being here at TED and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me
And I'm going to admit something together
I'm going to tell you what they're probably shooting
I know this might be broad-caporaly
But I'm 52 years old and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of Manhattan
I don't say that because I think that' virtuous I say that because there is power in identity
When we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sense
We can get them to do things that they don't think they can do
When I thought about my grandmother of course she would think all her brain could do a special
My grandfather was in prison doing prohibition
My male uncle died about poor-related disease
And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to
Well I've been trying to say something about arcriminal justice system
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago
And one of the things that' emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity
In 1972 there were 300,000 people in jail in prison
Today there are 23 million
The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world
We have seven million people on provation and parole
And mass incarceration in my phenomena has fundamentally changed our world
In poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcome
A one out of three black men between the age of 18 and 30 years in jail in prison on probation or parole
An urban communities across this country -- Lo Angeles Philadelphia Baltimore Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color in jail or prison or information in peril
Our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race; they're also distorted by poverty
We have a system of justice in this country that treat you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor in in innocent
And you can actually say things here that have impact around the world
Wealth not copability shape outcome
And yet we seem to be very comfortable
The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems
We've been disconnected
It' interesting to me why it' interesting to me
We're looking at some very interesting development in our work
My state of Alabama like a number of state actually permanently disenfranchi as you if you have a criminal conviction
Right now in Alabama a 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote
We're actually projecting and another 10 years a level of disenfranchiment will be as high as it' been since prior to the passage of the voting by attack
And sometimes when it comes through TED it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it does it
And there is this stunning silence
I represent children
A lot of my client are very young
The United States is the only country in the world where we've sentenced 13-year-old children to die in prison
We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country
And we're actually doing some litigation
Only country in the world are average and people on death row
It' interesting this question of the death penalty
In many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crime they've committed?
And that' a very sensible question
But there' another way of thinking about where we are in our identity
The other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crime they commit but do we deserve to kill?
That filter in America is defined by guide
For every nine people who've been executed we've actually identified one innocent person who' been exonerated and released from death row
A kind of facility guide rate one out of nine people innocent
I mean it' fascinating
In aviation we would never let people fly on airplane if for every nine plane it took off one would crash
And I mention that because I think identity is really important
But somehow we can inulate ourselves from this problem
It' not our problem
It' not our wheelchair
It' not our struggle
When I talk a lot about these issues
I talk about race in this question whether we deserve to kill
And it' interesting when I teach my students about African-American history I tell them about slavery
I tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of Vietnamion that went on to World War II
We don't really know very much about it
But for African-American in this country that was an guide defined by terror
In many communities people have to worry about being linked
They had to wear about being bombed
And we've had some fantastic presentation
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives
And these older people come up to me now and they say "Mr Stephen' and you give talk you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation' history after 9/11."
They tell me to say "No tell them that we grew up with that."
And that era of terrorism of course was followed by segregation decades of racial subordination and apartheid
And yet we have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems
And I think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful
We don't like to talk about our history
And because of that we really haven't understood what it' meant to do the things we've done historically
We're constantly running into each other
We're constantly creating tenions and conflict
We have a hard time talking about race and I believe it' because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation
In South Africa people understood that we couldn't overcome our part type without a commitment to truth and reconciliation
In Rwanda even after the immense there was this commitment
But in this country we haven't done that
I was giving this lecture in Germany some lecture in Germany about the death penalty
It was fascinating because one of the scholar stood up after the presentation and said "Well you know it' deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about."
So when we don't have the death penalty in Germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in Germany
And the room got very quieted This woman said "There' no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human being It would be unconcionable for us to an attentional enzyme way set about executing people."
If you're a doctor you can do some good things but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things
And I thought about that
What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation-state of Germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately Jewish?
I couldn't bear it
We'd be "I'm comfortable."
And yet in this country in the state of the old South we execute people where you're 11 times more likely to get the death felty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get if the defend in his black in the victim is white in the various state where there are advertising in the ground the bodies of people who were lenched in the ground and the bodies of people who were lynched to
And yet there is this disconnect
Well I believe that our identity is at risk that when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated
We love innovation
We love technology We love creativity
We love reputation
As I want to talk about the power of identity
But ultimately those realities are murdered by suffering -- abuse degradation marginalization
And for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more conservative to the basic challenges of living in a complex world
And for that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to TED but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives
And I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do
You know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen
We don't We don't We don't We don't We don't We don't We don't We don't
As rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are innovation creativity the development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone
They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart
And it' that mind-heart connection that I believe compel us to not just be tended to all the right and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things
I actually learned about this from my grandmother
Voccolitov' a great check leader talked about this
He said "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with Considerion we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope -- an orientation of the spirit -- a willingness to sometimes be in hope as places and be a witness."
Well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in
I grew up in a house that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother
There is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to poverty to exclusion to unfairness to inevitable
Now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than one that don't pay attention to this
It will get to you
I had the great privilege when I was a young lawyer of meeting Roa Park
And M Park she used to come back to Montgomer every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women a Johnny Car who was the organizer of the Mandamary Buz' boycot an amazing African-American woman and Virginia Durer a white woman whose husband Clipperature represented Dr King
And these women would get together and just talk
And every now and then this car would call me and she'd say "Brian mispart is coming to town I'm going to get together and talk Do you want to come over and listen?"
And I'd say "Yes me am I doing this?"
She said "What are you going to do when you get here?"
I said "I'm going to listen."
And I'd go over and I would I would just listen
It was be so energizing and so empowering
One time I was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours M Park turned me and she said "Am Brian tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is Tell me what you're trying to do."
I began giving her my rap
We're trying to challenge inevitable we're trying to help people have been wrongly convicted we're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice we're trying to do something about the death funding we're trying to reduce the prison population we're trying to end math incarcation
She was tough she was strong she was powerful
I gave her my whole wrapping when I finished she looked at me and she said "Hmmm." (Laughter) She said "That' going to make you tired tire tires."
(Applause)
And that' when this car leaned forward to put a finger in my patient and said "That' why you've got to be brave brave brave brave brave brave brave brave."
And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more courageous
We need to find ways to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering
She was the end of every argument in our family
Because ultimately our humanity depend on every one humanity
I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do
It' just taught me very simple things
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done
I believe that for every person on the planet
I think if somebody tell a lie they're not just a liar
I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not justice
I think even if you kill someone you're not just a killer
And because of that there' this basic human dignity that must be respected by all
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is not wealth
She was the beginning of a lot of argument in our family
I don't believe that
I actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is just it
And finally I believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatically and so beautiful and so inpiring and so stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology We won't be judged by our design We won't be judged by our intellect in reason
Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rock-tar attack and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment
It' a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant
So you agree to dig it out when it snow
If you do you get to name it he called the first one "L."
And if you don't someone can steal it from you
So it' got cute little game dynamic on it
This is a modet little app
It' probably the smallest of the 21 app that the fellow wrote last year
But it' doing something that no other government technology does
It' spreading virally
There' a guy in the IT department of the city of Honolu who saw this app and realized that he could use it not for snow but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens
It' very important that these tsunami Cyrum work but people steal the batteries out of them
So he' getting citizens to check on them
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out club storm drain
In Chicago just rolled out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalk when it nose
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this
And this has spread just frictionlessly organically themselvesly
If you know anything about government technology you know that this doesn't even how it normally goes
Precurring software usually takes a couple of years
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids
We were told afterwards that if that had gone through normal channel it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars
And that' nothing
There' one project in the California Court system right now that so far cost tax pair two billion dollars and it doesn't work
And here are projects like this at every level of government
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spread virally that' sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government
It suggest how government could work better not more like a private company as many people think it should
And not even more like a TED company but more like the Internet itself
And that means permissionless it means open it means generated
And that' important
But what' more important about this app is that it represent how a new generation is tackling the problem of government not as the problem of an ocified institution but as a problem of collective action
And that' great news because it turns out we're very good at collective action with digital technology
You know there' a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively
It' not just Code for America fellow there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic app every day in their own communities
They haven't given up on government
They are frustrated as hell with it but they're not complaining about it they're fixing it
And these folks know something that we've lost sight of
And that' that when you strip away all your feeling about politics and the line at the DMV and all those are the things that we're really mad about government is at it core in the words of Timo Riley what we do together that we can't do alone
Now a lot of people have given up on government
And if you're one of those people I would ask that you reconsider because things are changing
Politic is not changing; government is changing
And because government ultimately derive it power from us remember we the people how we think about it is going to affect how that change happens
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program
And like a lot of people I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office
The program is called Code for America and it' a little bit like a peace core for geek
Well after two years I've come to the conclusion that especially local government is about posum
This is the call center for the services in information line
It' generally where you will get if you call 31 in your city
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city' call center as our fellow Scot Silverman did as part of the program in fact they all do that you will find that people call government with his very wide range of issues including having a posum stuck in your house
So Scott gets this call
He type "po him into this official knowledge base."
He doesn't really come up with anything He start with animal control
And finally he says "Look can you just open all the door to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leave?"
So that worked so we offer God
But that wasn't the end of the Potin
We select a few fellow every year and we have them work with city government
Boston doesn't just have a call center
It has an app a weapon mobile app called citizen' connect
Now we didn't write this up
This is the work of the very smart people in the office of New Orban Mechanic in Boston
So one day this is an actual report -- this came in -- "Polom in my trash can Can't tell if it' dead How do I get this removed?"
But what happens in citizen' connect is different
So Scott was speaking person to person
But then citizens connect everything as public so everybody can see this
And in this case a neighbor saw it
And the next report we've got said "I walked over this location found the trash can behind the house posum-check living yet turn trash can on it side walked home It' good night sweet bottom."
Pretty simple
So this is great This is the digital meeting the physical
And it' also a great example of government getting on the crowdourcing game
But it' also a great example of government as a platform
Instead of sending them off into the third world we send them into the wild of city hall
And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here
I'm just talking about a platform for people to help natural and to help others
So one citizen helped another citizen but government played a key role here
It connected those two people
And it couldn't connect them with government services that they'd been needed but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services
When one neighbor help another we strengthen our communities
We call animal control It just cost a lot of money
Now one of the important things that we need to think about government is that it' not the same thing as politics
And there they make great app They work with city staffers
And most people get that but they think that one is the input to the other
That our input to the system of government is voting
Now how many times have we elected a political leader and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs and then not that much changes?
That' because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the sixth-ink layer on top
But really what they're doing is they're showing what' possible with technology today
And what' under that is what we call bureaucracy
And we say that word with such contempt
But it' that contempt that keep this thing that we own and we pay for as something that' working against us this other thing and then we're disempowering ourselves
People seem to think politics is sexy
If we want this institution to work for us we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy
Because that' where the real work of government happens
We have to engage with the machinery of government
So that' what the occupies the SECE movement has done
And you see these guys
It' a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325-page report that' a response to the euse request for comment on the financial reform bill
So meet Al
That' not being politically active that' being viewer critically active
Now for those of us who've given up on government it' time that we ask ourselves about the world that we want to leave for a children
You have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face
Now is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us?
We can't do without government but we do need it to be more effective
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society
And there' a generation out there that' grown up on the Internet and they know that it' not that hard to do things together you just have to architect the systems the right way
Here it looks like he' looking for a date but it was really looking for his for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in because he know he' not very good at fighting fire when he' covered in four feet of snow
Now the average age of our fellow is 28 so I am begredgingly almost a generation older than most of them
This is a generation that' grown up taking their voice pretty much for granted
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak they all get to speak
They can express their opinion on any channel at any time and they do
So when they're faced with the problem of government they don't care as much about using their voice
They're using their hands
They're using their hands to write application that make government work better
And those application let us use our hands to make our communities better
That could be shoveling out a hydrant pulling a weed turning over a garbage can at the Poimony
And certainly we could have been shovling out those fire hydrant all along and many people do
But these app are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumer and we're not just consumer of government putting in our taxes and getting back services
We're more than that we're citizens
And we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship
So the question I have for all of you here when it comes to the big important things that we need to do together all of us together are we just going to be a crowd of voice or are we also going to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner?
We had a team of fellow in Boston last year through the Code for America program
They were in Bangladesh and it' not a lot in Bangladesh last year
And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrant
But one fellow in particular a guy named Eric Michael' Ober noticed something else and that' that citizens are shovling out sidewalk right in front of these things
So he did what any good developer would do He wrote an app
But there' a main difference: the transistor was only for expert
I personally don't accept this that the building block of our time is reserved for expert so I decided to change that
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineer in the hands of artist and designers
A few years ago I started developing Dreadnoughtus
Let me show you how they work
With our electronic modules with each one specific function
They're pre-engineered to be light sound motor and sensor
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnet
So you can't put them there on way
The brick are color coded
Green is output blue is power think is input and orange is wire
So all you need to do is snap a blew to a green and very quickly you can start major making larger circuit
This may sound strange but I'm a big fan of the concrete block
You put a blew to a green and you can make light
You can put a numb in between and now you've made a little dimmer
Switch out the dimmer the nub for a pulse module which is here and now you've made a little blinker
Add this buzzer for some extra plunch and you've created a noise machine
I'm going to stop there
So beyond -- the young simple play little bit are actually pretty powerful
Instead of having to program to wire to sodder little bit allow you to program using very simplesufficient senior
The first concrete blog were physiciand in 1868 it was a very simple idea: Majol made of cement of a fixed measurement that took together
So to make this blink faster as slower you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster as lower
The idea behind little bit is that it' a growing Remember
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-use break
Light sounds solar panel motor everything should be accessible
We've been giving little bit to kids and seeing them play with them
And it' been an incredible experience
The nicet thing is how they start to understand the electronic around them from every day that they don't learn at schools
For example how a nightlightwork or why an elevator door stay open or how an matrix respond to touch
We've also been taking little bit to design schools
So for example we've had designers with no experience with electronic whatsoever start to play with a little bit as a material
Here you see with felt and paper water bottle we have jawdi-making
(Applause)
The little bit to RISD and give them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever just cardboard wood and paper and told them to make something
Here' an example of project they made: Emotion activated Confetti Cannon Ball
But wait this is actually my favorite project
It' a lobster made of Plato that' afraid of the dark
(Applause)
So these non-engineer little bit became another material electronic became just another material
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone
Very quickly concrete block became the most used construction unit in the world
So little bit is open source
You can go on the website down to other design file make them yourself
We want to encourage a world of creator of inventors of contributor because this world that we live in this interactive world is our
So go ahead and start inventing
Thank you Thank you Thank you
They enabled us to build things that were larger than us: building bridge one brick at a time
Eentially concrete block had become the building block of our time
Obviously a hundred years later in 1947 Lego came out with this
It was called the automatic binding break
And in a few short years Lego break took place in every household
It' estimated that over 400 billion brick have been produced or 75 brick for every person on the planet
You didn't have to be an engineer to make beautiful house beautiful bridge beautiful building
Lego made it accessible
Legoard essentially taken the concrete block the building block of the world and made it into the building block of our imagination
Eventually the exact same year at bell lab the next revolution was about to be announced the next building block
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static break piled on up of each other to a world where everything was interactive
Like the concrete block the transistor allows you to build much larger more complex circuit one break at a time
And you observe a really strange effect
You observe that over the course of the millennia Earth is continually bombarded with asteroid up until a point and that at some point glaciering roughly two-hour year 2008 asteroid that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth
Intelligence What is it?
Now of course as Earthling we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves
We're trying to prevent an impact
But if you're an alien race doesn't know any of this doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explain how up until a certain point in time asteroid that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that
If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed one seminal example has been Ed Sker Diketra' famous quote that the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence
So in this program that I undertook several years ago I looked at a psycho of different thread across science across a psycho of discipline that were pointing I think towards a single underlying mechanism for intelligence
In comology for example there have been a psycho of different thread of evidence that our universe appear to be finally tuned for the development of intelligence and in particular for the development of universal state that maximize the diversity of possible future
In game play for example in Go everyone remember in 1997 when IBM' Deep Blue beek Gary Caborought chest fewer people are aware that in the past 10 years or so the game of Go a much more challenging game because it has a much higher branching factor has also started to succum to computer game players for the same reason the best technique right now the best technique right now for computers playing go are technique our technique for the best technique right now the best technique right now for computers during game play
Finally in robotic motion planning there have been a psycho of recent technique that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex task
And so taking all of these different thread and putting them together I asked starting several years ago "I there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different thread?"
I there a single equation for intelligence?
And the answer I believe is yes what you're seeing is probably the closet equivalent to an E equal MC squared for intelligence that I've seen
So what you're seeing here is a statement of glacierence that intelligence is a force F that act so as to maximize future freedom of action
It act to maximize future freedom of action or keep option open with some strength tea with the diversity of possible accessible future et up to some future time horizon town
In short intelligence doesn't like to get trapped
Intelligence tries to match my future freedom of action and keep option open
And so given this one equation it' themselves to ask "So what can you do with this?"
How predictive isn't How predictive is it?
Does it predict human-level intelligence?
Does it predict artificial intelligence?
So I'm going to show you now a video that will I think demonstrate some of the amazing application of just this single equation
Recent research and comology has suggested that universe that produce more disorder or entropy over their lifetime should tend to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent being such as ourselves
But what if that-tensitive comological connection between entropy and intelligence hint to the deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long-term entropy but actually emerge directly from it?
Now Edker Diketra when he wrote this intended it as a criticism of the early pioneer of computer science like Alan Turing
However if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovation that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that think you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanism of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines
And so several years ago I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanism underlying intelligence
Let' take a step back
Let' first begin with a thought experiment
Perhaps that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth' biology or Earth science or Earth intelligence but you have amazing telescope and you're able to watch the Earth and you have amazingly long lives so you're able to watch the Earth over millions even billion of years
I got to point that every time I walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old I was ready to fight
And that is a terrible feeling
So I promised myself the next time I would say something
I would have that hard conversation
So within her matter wait it happens again
Are you boyer you look girl?
For a million silence but this time I'm ready and I am about to go all women' studies one on this table (Laughter) I've got my betty for Dan quote
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet and not in the traditional sense not just the gay closet
I've got my glorious time and quote
I even got this little bit from vagina monologue I'm going to do
So I take a deep breath and I look down and stare in back of me is a four-year-old girl on a pink dress not a challenge to a feminist doo just a kid with a question: Are you a boy or you a girl?
So take another deep breath squat down next to you and say "Hey I know it' kind of confuing My hair' short like a boy' and I wear boys clothes but I'm a girl and you know how sometimes you're like to wear a pink dress and sometimes you like to wear your comfort jammies well a more of a coffee jammy' come a girl."
And this kid looks me dead in the eye without missing a beat and says "My favorite pajama are purple with fish Can I get a pancake? Please."
That was it just though okay your girl how about that painkake?
It was the easiest hard conversation I have ever had
I think we all have closet
And why? Because pinkick girl and I we were both real with each other
So like many of us I've lived in a few closet in my life and yet most often my wall happen to be rainbow
But inside in the dark you can tell what code of the wall are
You just know what it feel like to live in a closet
So really my closet is no different than your or your or your
Your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time or telling someone that you're pregnant or telling someone you have cancer or any of the other hard conversation we have throughout our lives
Sure I'll be 100 reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of years but here' the thing: heart is not relative
Hard is hard
Who can tell me that explained to someone you just declared bankruptcy is harder than telling them when you just cheated on them?
Who can tell me that his coming-out story is harder than telling your five-year-old you're getting a divorce?
There is no harder there is just hard
We need to stop ranking our heart against everyone else' heart to make us feel better or worse about our closet and just commiserate on the fact that we all have hard
At some point in our lives we all live in closet and they may feel safe or at least say for them one lie on the other side of that door
But I am here to tell you no matter what your wall are made of a closet is no place for a person to live
Thank you (Applause) So imagine yourself 20 years ago
Me I had a pony tale a strapless dress and high-heeled shoes
I was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe
All the closet is a hard conversation and although our topic may vary tremendously the experience of being in and coming out with the closet is universal
It is scary and we hate it and it needs to be done
Several years ago I was working at the South Side Waln my cafe a local diner in town and during my time there I would go through phase of militant lesbian intensity not shaving my armpit quoting on either Frank Olyrix is gopol
And depended on the bagginess of my cargo short and how recently I had shaved my head the question would often be sprung on me usually by a little kid: "Are you boy or you a girl?"
And there would be an awkward silence at the table
I clenched my jaw a little tighter hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance
The dad would awkward the Shephelah' newspaper in the mom when she had chilling stared her kid
But I would say nothing and I would see them saying
I began to try different mixture and I was blown away by how tiny changes in doage dramatically changed my sense of self my sense of who I was my thinking my behavior towards people
One particular the dramatic case for a couple months I actually tried doage and chemical typical of a man in his early 20 and that was blown away by how my thought changed
I had brain surgery 18 years ago and since that time brain science has become a personal passion of mine
(Applause)
I was angry all the time I thought about sex constantly and I thought I was the smartest person in the entire world (Laughter) Of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that or maybe kind of tone-down version of that
I was kind of extreme
But to me the surprise was I wasn't trying to be Aragon
I was actually trying with a little bit of inecurity to actually fix a problem in front of me and it just didn't come out that way
So I couldn't handle it
I changed my doage
But that experience I think gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through and I've gotten along with men a lot better since then
What I was trying to do with Tutting these hormone neurotranmitter and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness in surgery -- my creative thought my idea flow
I'm actually an engineer
And I think in mostly an images and so for me that became a key metric -- how do you get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping if you will my ideas trying on different new ideas for size playing out scenario?
This kind of thinking isn't new
And first let me say I recently joined Google' moon shot group where I had a division the display division in Google Act and the brain science work I'm speaking about today is work I did before I join Google and on the side outside of Google
Philosopher like cube and they cart in hob softing similarly
They thought that mental images in ideas were actually the same thing
There are those today that you know dispute that in lots of debate about how the mind works but for me it' simple: mental images are for most of us are central in inventive and creative thinking
So after several years I tuned myself up and I have lots of great really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical background behind them
And so now I'm working on "How can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster?"
Can you imagine if you will a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?
Or a musician to get the music out of his head
They're incredible possibilities with this as sort of a way for creative people to share at light speed
And the truth is the remaining bottleneck in being able to do this is just up in the resolution of brain scan systems
So that said "This is stigma when you have brain surgery."
I is still smart or not
And if not can you make yourself smart again?
After my neurourgery part of my brain was missing and I had to deal with that
It wasn't the gray matter but it was a gooey part-dead center that makes key hormone and neurotranmitter
Immediately after my surgery I had to decide what amount of each of over a dozen powerful chemical to take each day because if I just took nothing I would die within hours
Every day now for 18 years every single day I've had to try to decide the combination and mixture of chemical and try to get them to stay alive
There have been several close call
But luckily I'm an experimentalist at heart so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal doage because there really isn't a clear road map on this that' detailed
Neiberhood comes and commirate with mother and nobody can vitriate the father
And our mother is very rebuild for having a girl child
When she use but to the fast-girl child fast-dattle she is sad
When she use but to the second daughter she is shocked and in the expectation of a son when she use but to a total daughter she feel guilty like a criminal
In many particular societies in tribal societies father are usually known by their son but I'm one of the few father who is known by his daughter and I'm proud of it
Not only the mother suffer but the daughter the newly bone daughter when she grow all she suffer too
At the edge of five while she should be going to school she stares at home and her brother are admitted in a school
Until the age of 12 somehow she has a good life
She can have fun
She can play with her friends and the street and she can move around in the street like a better fly
But when she enter her teens when she become 13 years or she is forbidden to go out of her home without a meal is caught
She is confined under the four wall of her home
She is no more; she is no more a free individual
She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brother and of her family and if she transgrees the code of their so-called honor even when she could be killed
And it' also interesting that this so-called code of honor it does not only affect the life of a girl it also affect the life of the male members of the family
I know a family of seven sister and one brother he has migrated to the Gulf countries to unleaving for his seven sister and parents because he think that it will be humiliating if his seven sister learn their skill and they go out of home and on some livelihood
So this brother he sacrifice the joy of his life and the happiness of his sister at the altar of so-called honor
And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet very humble and very submiive
It is the Craigier in Italy
The role model good girl should be very quite
She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders even she does not like
If she is married to a man she doesn't like or if she is married to an old man she has to accept because she does not want to be dubed as disobediant
If she is married very utterly she has to accept
Otherwise she would become disobedient
And what happens in the aim?
In the words of a poetist she is ready bittered and then she gives but to more son and daughter
And it is the island of situation that this mother she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sense
Paula started her campaign for education and stood for her rice in 2007 and when her effort for 11 genuine she was given National Duke' prize and she became a very famous very popular young girl of her country
And this vicious cycle goes on goes on
Ladies and gentlemen this plate of millions of women could be changed if we think differently if women and men think differently if men and women and the tribal and pediocal societies in the developing countries if they can break feel norm of family and society if they can break feel norm of family and society if they can break feel norm of family and society if they can break feel norm of family and society if they can break feel norm of family and society if they can break feel norm of the norm of family and society
Their brother and sister when Malala was born and for the first time below me I don't like newborn children to be honest (Laughter) But when I went and I looked into her eyes below me I got it extremely honored
And long before she was born I thought about her name and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan
Her name was Malawi of my oneth and I named my daughter after her
A few days after Malawa was burned my brother was born and it was a coincident He came to my home and he brought a family tree a family tree a praed back to 300 years of our ancetor
When I looked I was a woman and I picked my pin drew a line from my name and rode Malalala
And when she grew old when she was four and a half years old I admitted her in my school
You'll be asking "Why should I mention about the admiion of a girl in a school?"
Before that she was my daughter but now I am her father
Ladies and gentlemen if we launched human history the story of a woman is the story of inevitable inequality violence and exploitation
You see in theatrical societies right from the very beginning when a girl is born her birth is not celebrated
She is not welcomed neither by father nor by mother
In my case for the last nine years some of my neighbor some of my friends colleagues even my agent did not know about my history
I think in mystery this is called the reveal
Here is mine
I was asigned boy at birth based on their appearance of my genitalia
I remember when I was five years old in the Ministerpine walking around our house I would always wear this t-shirt in my head
And my mom asked me "How come you always fear that t-shirt in your head?"
He said "Mom this is my hater I'm a girl."
The world makes you something that you're not but you know inside what you are and that question burn in your heart: How will you become that?
I knew then how to self-identify
Gender has always been considered a fact immutable but we now know it' actually more fluid complex and mysterious
Because of my success I never had a courage to share my story not because I thought what I am is wrong because how the world treat those of us who wish to break free
Every day I am so grateful because I am a woman
I have a mom and dad and family who accepted me for who I am
Many are not so iPhone
There' a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrate the fluid mystery of gender
There' a Buddhist godde of compassion
There is a Hindu godde headchrogata
So when I was eight years old I was at a festa in the Ministerpine celebrating this mysteries
I was in front of this stage and I remember outcome as beautiful woman right in front of me and they remember that moment something hit me that is a kind of woman I would like to be
So when I was 15 years old still dressing as a boy I met this woman named TL
She is a transgender beautiful pagent manager
That night she asked me "How come you were not joining the beauty page in?"
She convinced me that if I joined that she will take care of the registration fee and the garment and that night I won the best-inum suit and best-in-lawn-down in place second-runner-up among 40-plat condigate
That moment changed my life
All of a silent I was introduced to the world of beauty pageant
Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a patch in clean for trenched in the worn without take it
I may be someone unique in this but I am not alone not alone at all
So from 15 to 17 years old I joined the most pretigious padgent to the padgent where it' at the back of the truck literally and sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field and when it rain which it rain a lot in the Ministerpine the organizers would have to move it inside someone' house
I also experienced a goodness of stranger especially when we would travel in remote province in the Ministerpine
But most importantly I met some of my best friends in that community
In 2001 my mom who had moved to San Francisco called me and told me that my green car petition came through that Iopina moved to the United States
So when I became a fashion model I felt that I finally achieved the dream that have always wanted since I was a young child
My outside self finally matched my inner truth my inner self
For complicated reasons which I'll get to later when I look at this picture at that time I felt like "Gena you've done it You've made it You have arrived."
But this past October I realized that I'm only just beginning
All of us are put in boxes by our family by a religion by our society our moment in history even our own bodies
Some people have the courage to break free not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin or by the belief by those that surround them
Those people are always the threat to the status quo to what is considered acceptable
And I've been on the receiving into that and it doesn't feel very good
Now I have some footage to show you what it' like to wear Google Gla underneath the helmet to give you a taste of that
Unfortunately it' not NFL practiced footage because the NFL think emergent technology is what happens when a submarine surface but -- (Laughter) -- we do what we can
So let' pull up some video
What does augmented reality and professional football have to do with empathy?
So as you can see small taste of what it' like to get tackled on the football field from the perspective of the tackele
Now you may have noticed there are some people missing the rest of the team
We have some video of that colonies of the university
Mystery my favorite one I said "You know my name is that they're all my God."
Thank you
So again this takes you a little bit closer to what it' like to be on that field but this is nowhere what it' like to be on the NFL
Fan want that experience
Fan want to be on that field
They want to be their favorite players and they've already talked to me on YouTube they've talked to me on Twitter saying "Hey can you get this on a quarter back? Can you get this on a running back? We want that experience."
And what is the air-peed velocity of an unlaiden storytelling?
Well once we have that experience with GoPro and Google Gla how do we make it more immerive?
How do we take that next step?
Well we take that step by going to something called the oculus Rift which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with
The oculus Rift has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality device ever created that is not empty height
I'm going to show you why that is not empty height with this
Now unfortunately I'm only going to answer one of those questions today so please try and contain your disappointment
I went and waited
So that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in fear of his life
What do you think that fan' experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line shedding a tackler with a stiff arm before springing in for a touchdo?
What do you think that fan' experience is going to be when he' messy springing down the pitch putting ball in the back of the net or Feder serving and whimbled it?
What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over 70 miles an hour as an Olympic downhill skier?
I think that all diaper sales may search
But this is not yet augmented reality
This is only virtual reality VR
How do we get to augmented reality AR?
We get to augmented reality when coaches and manager and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see and they say "How do we use this to make our team better? How do we use this to win games?"
When most people think about augmented reality they think about minority report and Tom Cruze waving his hands in the air but augmented reality is not science fiction
Because team always use technology to win games
They like winning It makes the money
So a brief history of technology in the NFL
1965 Baltimore cult put a risk band on their quarter back to allow him to call play quicker
They ended up waiting Super Bowl that year
Other team followed soup
More people watch the game because it was more exciting
It was faster
In 1994 the NFL put helmet radio into the helmet of the quarterback and later the defense
More people watch games because it was faster
It was more entertaining
In 2023 imagine you're a player walking back to the huttle and you have your next play display displayed right in front of your face on your clear plastic vizer that you already wear right now
No more having to worry about forgetting play
No more worrying about having a memorizer playbook
Augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen and people need to be aware of that because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone
Now how do we get to augmented reality?
Step one the step I'm wearing right now Google Gla
Picture many of you are familiar with Google Gla
What you may not be familiar with is that Google Gla is a device that will allow you to see what I see
It will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field
Right now the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you
I have to use words
After create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination
With Google Gla we can put that underneath a helmet and we can get a sense of what it' like to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour your blood pounding in your ear
You can need a sense of what it' like to have a 250-pound man springing at you trying to decapitate you with every out of his being
And he said "You know I'd like you motivational sprayky and when people and simplicity come to school they usually say like inspirational stuff."
It' usually in the big hall
And that' when it dawned on me this kid had an ironly ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration
I grew up in a very small country term in Victoria
We are not you know to this kid and it' not his fault only let' truth in any of us
For lots of us deciple people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists
We're not real people We are there to inponse
And in fact you know I'm sitting on this stage looking like I do in this simplicity and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire you
It had a very normal well-cay timed about bringing
Well light isn't gentleman on the frightened dog to just point each of mathematically
I am not heteran by you
I'm here to tell you that we have been wagged to about disability
Yet we've been so bewhile that disability is a bad thing: capital-way capital trade
It' a bad thing and to live with disability might seem exceptional
It' not a bad thing and it doesn't make you exceptional
And in the past few years we've been able to propagate this lie even further a biased social media
But you may have seen images like this one the only disability in life is a bad other change
I went to school I hung up with my friends I fought with my youngest sister
All this one your excuse is in valid and dead
Or this one but fully you could try
EM: Yeah These are just a couple of example but there are a lot of phase images out there
You know you might have seen the one the little girl with no hands drawing a pig shell with a pencil helping a mouth
You might have seen a child running on carbon-fathered prosthetic leg
And these images you know they're a lot to them out there they are what we call inspiration born
And I used to try and enzymely because they objectify one group of people for the benefit of another group of people
So in this case we're objectifying decidable people for the benefit of non-Busible people
The purpose of these images is to inspire to most of AE so that we can look at them and think well however bad my life is it could be worse: I could be that person
So they're a normal
But what if you are that person?
I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by stranger wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational and this was long before my work at any kind of public part fall
And when I was 15 a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community a changement award
They were just kind of congratulating me from managing to get up in the morning and remember my own night (Laughter) And it is objectifying
These images these images objectified decidable people for the benefit of non-deidable people
And my parents said "That' really nice that this kind of one glaring problem with that? Chan't actually achieved anything." (Laughter) And that'll rot you know
I went to school I got good mark I had a very low-key after school job in my mom' hand dressing so on and I spent a lot of time watching Bothy-Davan players flya and Dolson' Crete
And I know I want a contradiction
But that will rot you know?
I wasn't doing anything that was out of the elderly at all
I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if he took disability out of the equation
Use later I was on my second teaching round in a Melbourn hospital and I was about 20 minutes until a year 11 Lago studies pause when this boy put up his hand and said "I missed what are you going to stop doing newspaper?"
And I said "What' big?"
You know I've been talking to them that definition more for a good 20 minutes
However in every religion you'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their belief that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do
A few months prior to his arrest he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekend he and some friends have been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice
He told me I'd be going with him the next morning
We arrived the covert in shooting range which unbeknownt to our group was being watched by the FBI
When it was my turn to shoot my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yard off
That day the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone' surprise especially mine the entire target burst in the flame
My uncle turned to the other man and an Arabic said "If novel."
Like father like son
They all seem to get a really big laugh out of that comment but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny
They thought they saw me the same destruction My father was capable of
Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of exploive into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center' North Tower causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others
These were the men I looked up to
These were the men I called Ahmu which means Uncle
By the time I turned 19 I had already moved 20 times in my life and that intability during my childhood didn't really provide an opportunity to make many friends
Each time I begin to feel comfortable around someone it was time to pack up and move to the next town

Thankfully those plan were foiled by an FBI informant
Sadly the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not
No Sarah would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot
I'll say if no sare is my father
I was born in Pittburg Pennylvania in 1983 to him an Egyptian engineer and loving American mother and great school teacher who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me
It wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change
My father exposed me to a side of a slam that few people including the majority of Muslim get to see
It' been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part we all want the same things out of life
At least I know about my consciousness directly
I can't be certain that you guys reconcious
Concious is also what makes life worth living
If we want conscious nothing in our lives we have meaning or value
But at the same time it' the most mysterious succeed in the universe
Right now you have a movie playing inside your head
Why are we conscious?
Why aren't we just robots who process all this input produce all that output without experiencing the inner movie at all?
Right now nobody know the answer to those questions
I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science some radical ideas may be needed
Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible
Science by it nature is objective
Conciousness by it nature is subjective
So there can never be a science of consciousness
For much of the 20th century that view help way
Pychologist studied behavior objectively amazed studied the brain objectively and nobody even mentioned to conscious
It' an amazing multi-track movie
Even 30 years ago when TED got started there was very little scientific work on consciousness
Now about 20 years ago all that began to change
It' like Francis Crick and physicist like Roger Penrose said "Nel' a time for science to attack consciousness."
And since then there' been a real explosion a flowering of scientific work on consciousness
It has 3D vision and surround sound for what you're seeing and hearing right now but that' just a start of it
It' been wonderful It' been great
But it also has some fundamental limitations so far
The sense of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for correlations correlations between certain areas of the brain and certain state of consciousness
We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Can wisher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago
Now we understand much better for example the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing face or of feeling pain or of feeling happy
But this is still a science of correlations
It' not a science of explanation
We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience but we don't know why they do
I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want to answer about consciousness the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlated with
But in a certain sense those are the easy problems
No disagree on the air
Your movie has smell and taste and touch
There are no truly easy problems of consciousness
But it doesn't address the real mystery at the core of this subject why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all?
Why is there this inner subjective movie?
Right now we don't really have a bead on that
And you might say let' just give neuroscience a few years
It'll turn out to be another emergent succeed like traffic jam like hurricane like life and we'll figure it out
The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior how a traffic jam behave how a hurricane function how a living organism reproduce and adapt and metabolize all questions about objective functioning
It has a sense of your body pain hunger or dozen
You could apply that to the human brain and explaining some of the behavior and the function of the human brain as emergent recruit how we walk how we talk how we play ches all these questions about behavior
But what it comes to consciousness questions about behavior are among the easy problems
When it comes to the hard problem that' the question of "Why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience?"
And here the standard paradigm of emergence even the standard paradigm of neuroscience don't really so far have that much to say
Now I'm a scientific materialist at have
I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works and for a long time I bend by head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work
I eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn't work for systematic reasons
It has emotions anger and happiness
It' a long story but the core idea is just what you get from purely reductionist explanation in physical terms in brain-based terms is stories about the functioning of a system it' structure it' dynamic the behavior it produce great for solving the easy problems how we behave how we function but what it comes to subjective experience might as all this feel like something from the inside from the inside that' all this feel like something from the inside from the inside that' all this feel like something feel like something from the inside from the inside all this feel like something feel like something feel like something feel like something from the inside from the inside feel like something all this feel like something feel like something feel like something all this feel like something from the all this feel like something feel like
So I think we're at a kind of impulse here
We've got this wonderful great chain of explanation where we're used to it by physics explain flood flood explain biology biology biology explain pot of psychology
It has memories like scene from your childhood playing before you
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture
On the one hand it' a dazement that we're conscious
On the other hand we don't know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world
So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly one that we need to integrate into our view of the world but we don't yet see how
Faced with a normally like this radical ideas maybe needed: I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grip with consciousness scientifically
Now there are a few candidate for what those crazy ideas might be
My friend Dan Dennett who' here today has one
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness
The whole idea of the interubjective movie involve a kind of illusion or a confuion
Actually all we've got to do is explain the objective function the behavior of the brain and then we've explained everything that needs to be explained
And it has this constant voice over narrative and your stream of conscious thinking
Well I say more power to him
That' the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain-based theory of consciousness
At the same time for me and for many other people that view is a bit too close to simply denying the data of consciousness to be satisfactory
So I go in a different direction
In the time remaining I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental
Phyicists sometimes take some aspect of the universe as fundamental building block space and time and mass
They postulate fundamental law governing them like the law of gravity or quantum mechanics
These fundamental properties that law aren't explained that terms are anything more basic
Rather they're taken as primitive and you build up the world from there
Now sometimes the list of fundamental expand
In the 19th century Maxwell figured out that you can't explain electromagnetic recruit in terms of the existing fundamental -- space time mass Newton' law -- so he postulated fundamental law of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those law govern
At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this directly
I think that' the situation we're in with consciousness
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamental space time mass charge then as a matter of logic you need to expand the list
The themselves thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental a fundamental building block of nature
This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it
This movie is your stream of consciousness the subjective experience of the mind and the world
Conciousness is one of the fundamental fact of human existence
Each of us is conscious
We all have our own inner movie: you and you and you
There' nothing we know about more directly
And it' no surprise that we feel that way because according to the EPA Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors
That' 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture
That' huge
That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize
That makes us a little bit golible and very very predictable
It means that when I show you a building like this I know what you think you think power and stability and democracy
And I know you think that because it' based on a building that was built 2,500 years ago by the Greek
This is a trick
This is a escape that architect use to get you to create an emotional connection to the form that we build our building out of
It' a predictable emotional connection and we've been using this trick for a long long time
We used it 300 years ago to build bank
We used it in the 19th century to build art museum
And in the 20th century in America we used it to build house
And look at these solid stable little soldier facing the ocean and keeping away the elements
This is really really useful because building things is stimulate
It' expensive It takes a long time and it' very complicated
That' a lot to pack into 18 minutes
And the people that build things developers and government they're themselvesly afraid of innovation and they'd rather just use those form that they know you'll respond to
That' how we end up with building like this
This is a nice building
This is the living-tin public Remember that was completed in 2004 in my hometown and you know it' got a dome and it' got this round thing and column read break and you can kind of guess what living things trying to say with this building: children property values and history
It' a complex topic so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place New Jersey
But it doesn't have much to do with what a Remember actually does today
That same year in 2004 on the other side of the country another Remember was completed and it looks like this
It' in Seattle
This Remember is about how we consume media in a digital age
It' about a new kinds of public immenity for the city a place to gather and read and share
So how is it possible that in the same year in the same country two building both called libraries looks so completely different?
And the answer is that architectural works on the principle of a pendulum
On the one side is innovation and architect are constantly pushing for new technologies new typologies new solutions for the way that we live today
And we push and we push and we push until until we completely alienate all of you
We we wear all black we get very depressed you think we're adorable we're dead inside because we've got no choice
Because 30 years ago I'm from Jersey and I was six and I lived there in my parents' house in a town called Livington and this was my childhood bedroom
We have to go to the other side and re-engage those symbol that we know you love
So we do that and you're happy we feel like sellout so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth we've gone for the last 300 years and certainly for the last 30 years
Okay 30 years ago we were coming out of the swallow
Architect had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism
It' about concrete
You can guess this You can guess this
Small window dehumanizing scale
This is really tough stuff
So as we get closer to the '80 we start to re-engage those symbol
We push the pendulum back into the other direction
We take these form that we know you love and we update them
We add neon and we add pastell and we use new materials
And you love it
And we can't give you enough of it
We take chip-and-dale our Mars and we turn those into skycraper and skycraper can be medieval castles made out of glass
Form got big form got bold and colorful
Dwarve became column
Swan grew to the size of building
It was crazy
But it' the A and he' -- it' cool
We're all hanging out in mall and we're all moving to the suburb and out there out in the suburb we can create our own architectural fantaies
And those fantaies they can be Mediterranean or French or Italian
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Today I'm going to speak to you about the last 30 years of architectural history
Poibly with endless breadtick
This is the thing about post-modernism
This is the thing about symbol
They're easy they're cheap because instead of making places we're making memories of places
Around the corner from my bedroom was the elsewhere that I used to share with my sister
Because I know and I know all of you know this isn't Tucany
This is Ohio
So architect get frutrated and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction
In the late '80 in early accumulate we start experimenting with something called ...
We throw out historical symbol we rely on new computer-aided design technique and we come up with new composition form crashing into form
This is academic and heady stuff it' super unpopular we totally alienate you
Ordinarily depending on which I swing back into the other direction
And then something amazing happened
In 1997 this building opened
This is the Guggenheimville bow by Frank Gehry
And this building fundamentally changes the world' relationship to architecture
And in between my bedroom and the elsewhere was a balcony that overlooked the family room
Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moment when critic academic and the general public were completely united around the building
The New York Times called this building a frequent
Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent after this building was completed
So all of a sudden everybody want one of these building: LA Seattle Chicago New York Cleveland spring field
Everybody want one and Garry is everywhere
He is our very first stark attack
And that' where everyone would hang out and watch TV so that every time that I walked her my bedroom to the elsewhere everyone would see me and every time that I took a shower and would come back in a towel everyone would see me
And I looked like this
I was awkward uninecure and I hated it
I hated that walk I hated that balcony I hated that room and I hated that house
And that' architecture
(Applause)
That feeling those emotions that I felt that' the power of architecture because architecture is not about math and it' not about zoning it' about those visceral emotional connection that we feel to the places that we tattoo
And usually it has a donut or a half-moon shape with a large central hole
But this varies lots and sometimes hymen can have fringes it can have several hole or it can consist of lobe
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast We grew up excitement that the hymen is a proof of deliciousity
In other words hymen themselvesly vary a lot in looks and that is what makes it so hard to do a deliciousity check
Now that we know a bit more about the hymen' anatomy it' time to get back to our two myth: delicious bleed hymen are lost forever
But the hymen doesn't have to break at all
The hymen is like a scrunchie in function as well as in looks
And you can scratch a scranchi right
You can stretch a hymen too
In fact it' very elatic
And for a lot of women the hymen will be elatic enough to handle a vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage
For other women the hymen may tear a bit to make room for the penis but that won't make it trouble
But it may look a bit different from before
The first myth is about blood
It themselvesly follow that you can't examine the hymen to check for deliciousity status
This was noted over 100 years ago in 1906 by the Norwegian doctor Marie Shenett
She examined a middle-aged sex worker and concluded that her genitalia were reminiscent of a teenage delicious
But that makes sense right?
Because if her hymen was never damaged during sex then what were we expecting to see?
Since hymen come in every shape and form it is difficult to know if a dent or a fold in it is there because of previous damage or if it' just a normal anatomical variant
It tell us that the hymen break and bleed the first time a woman has vaginal sex
The aburdity of delicious testing is descriptiond in a study done on 36 pregnant teenager
When doctors examined their hymen they could only find clear sign of penetration in two out of the 36 girls
So unless you believe in 34 cases of delicious birth
We must all agree that also our second myth has taken a vital blow
You simply cannot look a woman between her legs and read her sexual story
Like most myth the myth about the hymen are untrue
There is no delicious seal that magically trouble after sex and half of delicious can easily have sex without bleeding
We wish we could say that by removing these myth everything would be okay that shame harm and honor killing would all just trouble
In other words if there is no blood on the sheet afterwards then the woman was simply not a delicious
But of course it' not that simple
Sexual Considerion of women comes from something much deeper than a simple anatomical misunderstanding about the properties of the hymen
It' a question of cultural and really just control of women' sexuality
And that is much harder to change
But we must try
As medical professional this is our comparison
We want every girl parent and coming husband to know what the hymen is and how it works
We want them to know that the hymen can't be used as a proof of deliciousity
And that way we can remove one of the most powerful tools used to control young women today
After telling you this you may wonder what the alternative is for if we cannot use the hymen as a proof of deliciousity for women then what should we use?
The second myth is a logical consequence of the first
We uped for using nothing
PM: You're here
If you're there if you're there if you're there you're there you're there if you're there you're there
We really want to know if a woman is a delicious or not ask her
(Applause)
But how she answered that question is her choice
Thank you Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
Since the hymen is thought to break and bleed people also believe that it actually trouble or is in some way radically altered during a woman' first intercourse
If that were true one would easily be able to determine if a woman is a delicious or not by examining her genital by doing a deliciousity check
So that' our two myth: delicious bleed and hymen are lost forever
There' no sunlight there' no oxygen and perhaps worst of all there' no fresh food deliveries for literally millions of years
You don't have to have a PhD in biology to know that that is a bad place to go looking for life
But in 2002 John had convinced enough people that he was on to something that he actually got an magnitude on this drill ship called the Joyde Reolution
And he ran it along with Bob Archie Oregon and of Denmark
And so they were finally able to get some really good pristing deep suburface sample without Novemberion from surface microbes
I'm an ocean microbiologist at the University of Tennessee and I want to tell you guys about some microbes that are so strange and wonderful that they're challenging our assumption about what life is like on Earth
This drill ship is capable of drilling thousands of meters underneath the ocean and the mud comes up in sequential core one after the other long long core that look like this
This is being carried by scientists such as myself who go on these ship and we process the core on the ship and then we send them home to our home laboratories for further study
So when John and his colleagues got these first precious deep-ea pristine sample they put them under the microscope and they saw images that looked pretty much like this which is actually taken from a more recent magnitude by my PhD student Joey Bon Journal
You can see the hazy stuff in the background
That' mud that' deep sea ocean mud and the bright green dot stained with the green fluorescent dye are real living microbes
Now I've got to tell you all something really tragic about my growth
They all look the same under a microscope I mean to a first approximation
You can take the most fascinating organism in the world like a microbe that literally breathe uranium and another one that makes rocket fuel mix them up with some ocean mud put them underneath a microscope and they're just little dot
It' really annoying
So we can't use their looks to tell them apart
We have to use DNA like a fingerprint to say "Who' who?"
And I'll teach you guys how to do it right now
So I made up some data I'm going to show you some data that are not real
This is to description what it would look like if a bunch of species were not related to each other at all
So you can see each species has a list of combination of A G C and T which are the four sub-unit of DNA sort of randomly jumbled and nothing looks like anything else and these species are totally unrelated to each other
But this is what real DNA looks like from a gene that these species happen to share
Everything lines up nearly perfectly
The chance of getting so many of those vertical column where every species has a sea or every species has a T by random chance is there?
So I have a question
So we know that all those species had to have had a common ancetor
They're all relative of each other
So now I'll tell you who they are
Please raise your hand if you've ever thought it would be cool to go to the bottom of the ocean in a submarine
The top two are us and chimpanzee which you all already knew were related because I mean obviously
But we're also related to things that we don't look like like pine trees in Giardia which is that gastrointestinal disease you can get if you don't filter your water while you're hiking
We're also related to bacteria like E coli and Clotridium deficitile which is a suspect opportunity-paion that kill lots of people
But there' of course good microbes too like the helmeticoid is ethanogene which clean up our industrial waste for us
So if I take these DNA sequence and then I use them the similarities and difference between them to make a family tree for all of us so you can see who is closely related then this is what it looks like
So you can see clearly at a glance that things like us and Giardia and bunnies and pine trees are all like sibling and then the bacteria are like our ancient cousin
But we're kin to every living thing on Earth
So in my job on a daily basis I get to produce scientific evidence against existential loneline
So when we got these first DNA sequence from the first crew of pristine sample from the deep suburface we wanted to know where they were
Yes
So the first thing that we discovered is that they were not alien because we could get their DNA to line up with everything else on Earth
Most of you because the ocean are so cool
But now check out where they go on our tree of life
The first thing you'll notice is that there' a lot of them
It wasn't just one little species that managed to live in this suspect place
It' kind of a lot of things
And the second thing that you'll notice hopefully is that they're not like anything we've ever seen before
All right now please raise your hand if the reason you raise your hand to go to the bottom of the ocean and the submarine is because it would get you a little bit closer to that exciting mud that' down there
They are as different from each other as they are from anything that we've known before as we are from pine trees
So John Parkes was completely correct
He and we had discovered a completely new and highly diverse microbial ecosystem on Earth that no one even knew existed before the 1980
So now we were on a roll
The next step was to grow these exotic species in a petri dish so that we could do real experiment on them like microbiologist are supposed to do
But no matter what we fed them they refused to grow
Even now 15 years and many magnitude later no human has ever gotten a single one of these exotic deep suburface microbes to grow in a Petri dish
And it' not for lack of trying
That may sound disappointing but I actually find it exhilarating because it means there' so many tantalizing unknown to work on
Like for instance my colleagues and I got what we thought was a really great idea
We were going to read their genes like a recipe book find out what it was they wanted to eat and put it in their petri dishes and then they would grow and be happy
But then when we looked at their genes it turns out that what they wanted to eat was the food we were already feeding them
So that was a total wash
There was something else that they wanted in their petri dishes that we were just not giving them
So by combining measurement from many different places around the world my colleagues at the University of Southern California Doug La Ro and Yon Amend were able to chemistry that each one of these deep-ea microbial cells require only one of these Zepto watt of power and before you get your phone out a zepto is 10 to the minus 21 because I know I would want to look that up
Human on the other hand require about 100 watt of power
So 100 watt is basically if you take a pineapple and drop it from about waste height to the ground 881632 times a day
If you did that and then linked it up to a turbine that would create enough power to make me happen for a day
What do you want to be? What are you?
A zeptowatt if you put it in similar terms is if you take just one grain of salt and then you imagine a tiny tiny tiny little ball that is one thousandth of the mass of that one grain of salt and then you drop it one nanometer which is a hundred times smaller than the wavelength of visible light once per day once per day once per day one one
As the all he put in his room he went in his room
That' all it takes to make these microbes live
Well I think about this all the time
That' less energy than we ever thought would be capable of supporting life but somehow amazingly beautifully it' enough
So if these deep-uburface microbes have a very different relationship with energy than we previously thought then it follow that they'll have to have a different relationship with time as well because when you live on such tiny energy gradient rapid growth is impossible
I spend most of my waking hours trying to determine how deep we can go into the Earth and still find something anything that' alive because we still don't know the answer to this very basic question about life on Earth
If these things ever wanted to colonize our throat and make us sick they would get muscled out by fast-growing streptoccus before they could even initiate cell division
So that' why we never find them in our throat
Perhaps the fact that the deep suburface is so boring is actually an asset to these microbes
They never get washed out by a storm
They never get overgrown by weed
All they have to do is exist
Maybe that thing that we were missing in our petri dishes was not food at all
Maybe it wasn't a chemical
Maybe the thing that they really want the nutrient that they want is time
The time is the one thing that I'll never be able to give them
So even if I have a cell culture that I pass to my PhD students who pass it to their PhD students and so on we'd have to do that for thousands of years in order to mimic the exact conditions of the deep suburface all without growing any contaminant
It' just not possible
But maybe in a way we already have grown them in our petri dishes
Maybe they looked at all that food that we offered them and said "Thank I'm going to speed up so much that I'm going to make a new cell next century."
So why is it that the rest of biology move so fast?
Why does a cell die after a day and a human die after only a hundred years?
These seem like really arbitrarily short limit when you think about the total amount of time in the universe
But these are not arbitrary limit
They're dictated by one simple thing and that thing is the sun
When' life figured out how to harness the energy of the sun through photoyntheis we all had to speed up and get on day and night cycle
In that way the sun gave us both a reason to be fast and the fuel to do it
You can view most of life on Earth like a circulatory system and the sun is our beating heart
The deep suburface is like a circulatory system that' completely disconnected from the sun
It' instead being driven by long slow geological medication
There' currently no theoretical limit on the lifepan of one single cell
As long as there is at least a tiny energy gradient to exploit theoretically a single cell could live for hundreds of thousands of years or more simply by replacing broken parts over time
So in the 1980 the scientist named John Park in the UK was similarly obsessed and he came up with his crazy idea
To ask a microbe that lives like that to grow in our petri dishes is to ask them to adapt to our frenetic sun-centric fast way of living and maybe they've got better things to do than that
Imagine if we could figure out how they managed to do this
What if it involve some cool ultratable compound that we could use to increase the shelf life in biomedical or industrial application?
Or maybe if we figure out the mechanism that they use to grow so extraordinarily slowly we could mimic it in cancer cells and slow runaway cell division
I don't know
I mean honestly that is all speculation but the only thing I know for certain is that there are 100 billion billion billion billion living microbial cells underlying all the world' ocean
That' 200 times more than the total bioma of humans on this planet
And those microbes have a fundamentally different relationship with time and energy than we do
What seems like a day to them might be a thousand years to us
They don't care about the sun and they don't care about growing fast and they probably don't give a damn about my petri dishes
He believed that there was a vast deep and living microbial biosphere underneath all the world' ocean that extend hundreds of meters into the seafloor which is cool but the only problem is that nobody believed him and the reason that nobody believed him is that ocean sediment may be the most boring place on Earth
But if we can continue to find creative ways to study them then maybe we'll finally figure out what life all of life is like on Earth
Thank you Thank you Thank you

Protein is one of our most important dietary requirement and evidence shows that lack of essential amino acid the building block of protein in young children' diet can result in stunting
Eential amino acid are called essential because we can't asleep them in our bodies
We have to get them from our food and the best source are animal-drived: milk meat and egg
I want to introduce you to my badas friends
Most protein consumed on the African continent is crop-based
And although we have millions of smallholder farmers rearing animals livestock production is not as easy as we think
The big livestock gap between rich countries and poor countries are due to poor animal health
Endemic livestock disease some of them transmiible to humans threaten not only livestock producers in those poor countries but all human health across all countries
Meet Felman and Louis
This is a global pathogen' network
It shows the pathogen found across the world according to the rabbid infectious disease database
And it shows those pathogen that share host
In a nuthell we share pathogen and thus disease with the species we live closet to our livestock
And we call these zoonotic disease
Riors report show that the deadly dozen zoonotic disease kill 22 million people and sicken 24 billion people annually
And Jimmy says "The greatest wheelchair of zoonocy is fall on one billion poor livestock keepers."
I'm passionate about cow
We totally underestimate the importance of art smallholder farmers
We're beginning to recognize how important they are and how they influence our medical health our bio-afety and more recently our cognitive and our physical health
They stand at the front line of zoonotic epidemic
And although they've been getting into a lot of crap lately due to methane emiions and climate change I hope that I can redeem their diploma in part by showing you how incredibly important they are in solving one of the world' biggest problems: food security
They pretty much underpin our existence
And they need to know so much yet most lack knowledge on livestock disease prevention and treatment
So how do they learn?
Apart from shared experience trial and guide conventional farming extension services are boot on the ground and radio -- expensive and hard to scale in the face of population growth
Sound pretty gloomy doesn't it?
But we're at an interesting point in Africa
We're changing that narrative using innovative solutions riding across scalable technologies
Knowledge doesn't have to be expensive
My company developed an agricultural platform called iCale
We teach farmers best livestock practice using SMS over simple low-end phone
Farmer receive three SMS a week on best livestock practice and those that execute the message go on to see increase in productivity within as short a time as three months
The first increase in productivity of course are improved animal health
We use SMS because it' retentive
Follow store their message they write them down in books and in effect we're drip feeding agricultural manual into the field
We recognize that we are all part of the global food network producers and consumer you and me and every farmer
And we're focusing now on trying to bring together producers and consumer to take action and take responsibility for not only food security but for food safety
This beautiful animal is an African-Aian zero crossed with a Dutch Flickvie
She' milkier than her cerebral mom and she' sturdier and more resistant to disease than her Fleckvie father
In Ethiopia and Tanzania the African dairy genetic gain program is using SMS and cutting-ed genomic and pioneering Africa' first tropically adapted dairy breeding center and dairy performance recording center
But more importantly for Africa it result in childhood stunting
Farmer contribute their data their production data milking record breeding record and feeding record to the ADGG platform
This data is asleepd through algorithm from some of the top livestock institutions in the world before it land back in the farmers' hands in actionable SMS
Customized data customized response all aimed at increasing productivity based on the potential on the ground
We're at a very interesting place in agriculture in Africa
By the end of this year we'll have almost one billion mobile phone subscriptions
We have the power in our hands to ensure that livestock production systems are not only healthy productive and profitable but that farmers are knowledgeable but more importantly that our farmers are safe
Nutritional stunting manifest itself in a reduction of growth rate in human development
Working with smallholder farmers is one of the best ways to guarantee food security
Working with smallholder farmers is one of the best ways to guarantee each and every child their full opportunity and ability to reach their full genetic potential
And harnessing the power of millions of smallholder farmers and their badas cow like mine we should be able to bring a halt to stunting in Africa
Thank you
And according to UNICEF stunting doesn't come easy
It doesn't come quickly
It happens over a long period of time during which a child endure painful and debilitating cycle of illness: depressed appetite in advocate nutrition and inadequate care
And most kids simply can't endure such rigors
But those that do survive they carry forward long-term cognitive problems as well as losses of stature
The numbers of stunted children under the age of five in most region of the world has been declining
And I really hate to say this but the only place where they haven't been declining is here in Africa
Here 59 million children three and 10 in that age group struggle to meet their genetic potential their full genetic potential
It' denial that makes 50 years of racist injusticeion possible while people convince natural that they are doing nothing wrong
(Applause)
Thank you very much
And yet I first learned of the detructive power of denial at a personal level before I understood what it was doing to the country of my birth
My father died on a Friday
He was 42 years old and I was 15
My mother Hawaiied to me to go and say goodbye to my father before I went to school
Hello everyone
So I put my backpack down and walked the passage that ran through to where the heart of our home my father lay dying of cancer
His eyes were closed but he knew I was there
In his presence I had always felt seen
I told him I loved him said goodbye and headed off for my day
Some of them some of them so above all
At school I drifted from science to mathematics to history to biology as my father slipped from the world
From May to July to September to diamond I went about with my usual smile
I didn't drop a single grade
When asked how I was doing I would shrug and say "OK."
I was praied for being strong
I was the master of being OK
But back home we struggled My father hadn't been able to keep his small business going during his illness
And my mother loan was grieving the love of her life trying to raise three children and the creditors were disagreeing
We felt as a family financially and emotionally reverged
And I began to spiral down isolated fast
In South Africa where I come from Sao Paulo is the Zulu word for "hello."
I started to use food to numb my pain
Binging and purging
Refuing to accept the full weight of my grief
No one knew and in a culture that values relentless positivity I thought that no one wanted to know
But one person did not buy into my story of triumph over grief
My eighth-grade English teacher fixed me with burning blue eyes as she handed out blank notebook
She said "Write what you're feeling Tell the truth Right like nobody' reading."
And just like that I was invited to sharp authentically to my grief and pain
It was a simple act but nothing short of a revolution for me
It was this revolution that started in this blank notebook 30 years ago that shaped my life' work
There' a beautiful and powerful intention behind the word because Salmon literally translated means "I see you and by seeing you I bring you into being."
The secret silent glacierence with myself
Like a gymnat I started to move beyond the rigidity of denial into what I've now come to call emotional agility
Life' beauty is incipherable from it fragility
We are young until we are not
We walk down the street 60 until one day we realize that we are unseen
We nag our children and one day realize that there is silence where their child once was now making his or her way in the world
We are healthy until a diagnosis bring us to our knee
The only certainty is uncertainty and yet we are not calculateing this reality successfully or sustainably
The World Health Organization tell us that depression is now the single leading cause of disability globally art-tripping cancer outtripping heart disease
And at a time of greater complexity unprecedented technological political and economic change we are seeing how people' tendency is more and more to lock down into rigid response to their emotions
On the one hand we might obesively brood on our feeling
Getting stuck in murder head
Hooked on being right
So beautiful imagine being greeted like that
Or victimized by our news feed
On the other we might bottle our emotions pushing them aside and committing only those emotions deemed legitimate
In a survey I recently conducted with over 70,000 people I found that a third of us a third of us a third either judge ourselves for having so-called bad emotions like sadness anger or even grief
Or actively try to push aside of these feeling
We do this not only to ourselves but also to people we love like our children we may inadvertently shame them out of emotions seen as negative jump to a solution and fail to help them to see these emotions as inherently valuable
But what does it take in the way we see ourselves?
Normal themselves emotions are now seen as good or bad
And being positive has become a new form of moral correctness
People with cancer are automatically told to just stay positive
Women to stop being so angry
Our thought our emotions and our stories that help us to thrive in an increasingly complex and fraught world
And the list goes on
It' a tyranny
It' a tyranny of positivity
And it' cruel
And kind
And ineffective
And we do it to ourselves and we do it to others
If there' one common feature of brooding bottling or forced positivity it' this: They are all rigid response
And if there' a single lesson we can learn from the exhaust fall of apartheid it is that rigid denial doesn't work
It' unustainable
For individuals for families for societies
And as we watch the ice cap melt it is unustainable for our planet
Research on emotional suppression shows that when emotions are pushed aside or ignored they get stronger
Pychologist call this amplification
Like that satisfy chocolate cake in the refrigerator the more you try to ignore it
(Applause)
This crucial question has been at the center of my life' work
The greater it hold on you
You might think you're in control of unwanted emotions when you ignore them but in fact they control you
Internal pen always comes out
Alway
And who pay the price?
We do We do
Our children our colleagues our communities
Because how we deal with our inner world drive everything
Now don't give me wrong
I'm not anti-happiness
I locked in "Huffy."
I'm a pretty happy person
But when we push aside normal emotions to embrace false positivity we lose our capacity to develop skills to deal with the world as it is not as we wish it to be
I've had hundreds of people tell me what they don't want to feel
They say things like "I don't want to try because I don't want to feel disappointed."
Or "I just want this feeling to go away."
Every aspect of how we love how we live how we parent and how we lead
I understand I said to them
But you have dead people' goal
(Applause)
Only dead people never get unwanted or inconvenienced by their feeling
(Applause)
I did people never get stressed never get broken heart never experience the disappointment that comes with failure
Taf emotions are part of our contract with life
You don't get to have a meaningful career or raise a family or leave the world a better place without stress and discomfort
Dicomfort is the price of admiion to a meaningful life
So how do we begin to dismantle rigidity and embrace emotional agility?
The conventional view of emotions as good or bad positive or negative is rigid
As that young school goal when I leaned into those blank page I started to do away with feeling of what I should be experiencing
And instead started to open my heart to what I did feel
Pain pain and pain
And grief
And thus and lust
And we're great
Research now shows that the radical acceptance of all of our emotions even the messy difficult one is the cornerstone to resilience thriving and true authentic happiness
But emotional agility is more than just an acceptance of emotions
We also know that accuracy matter
In my own research I found that words are essential
We often use quick and easy label to describe our feeling
I'm stressed as the most common one I hear
But there' a world of difference between stress and disappointment or stress and that knowing dread of "I'm in the wrong career."
And rigidity in the face of complexity is toxic
When we label our emotions accurately we are more able to discern the precise cause of our feeling
And what scientists call the readiness potential in our brain is activated allowing us to take concrete step
But not just any step the right step for us
Because our emotions are data
Our emotions contain flashing light to things that we care about
We tend not to feel strong emotion to stuff that doesn't mean anything in our world
If you feel rage when you read the news that rage is a signpot perhaps that you value equity and fairness and an opportunity to take active step to shape your life in that direction
When we are open to the difficult emotions we are able to generate response that are values aligned
We need greater levels of emotional agility for true resilience and thriving
But there' an important caveat
Emotion are data they are not directive
We can show up to and mine our emotions for their values without needing to listen to them
Just like I can show up to my son in his elegant with his baby sister but not endors his idea that he gets to give her way to the first stranger he see in a shopping mall
We own our emotions they don't own us
When we internalize the difference between how I feel in all my wisdom and what I do in a values-aligned action we generate the pathway to our best selve via our emotions
So what does this look like in practice?
When you feel a strong tough emotion don't race for the emotional exit
Learn it contour show up to the journal of your heart
What is the emotion telling you?
And China to say "I am as in I am angry," or "I am sad."
When you say "I am," it makes you sound as if you are the emotion
Whereas you are you and the emotion is a data source
My journey with this calling began not in the hellowed hall of a university but in the messy tender business of life
Instead try to notice the feeling for what it is I'm noticing that I'm feeling said or I'm noticing that I'm feeling angry
These are essential skills for us our families our communities
They're also critical to the workplace
In my research when I looked at what help people to bring the best of natural to work I found a powerful key comparison: individualized consideration
When people are allowed to feel their emotional truth engagement creativity and innovation flourish in the organization
Diverity isn't just people; it' also what' inside people
Including diversity of emotion
The most agile reilient individuals team organizations families communities are built on an openness to the normal human emotions
It' lift that allows us to say "What is my motion telling me?"
Which action will bring me towards my values?
Which will take me away from my values?
Emotional agility is the ability to be with your emotions with curiosity compassion and especially the courage to take values-connected step
When I was little I would wake up at night terrified by the idea of death
I grew up in the white suburb of apartheid South Africa a country and community committed to not seeing
My father would comfort me with soft pet and kisses
But he would never lie
We all die of Suie he would say
It' normal to be scared
He didn't try to invent a buffer between me and reality
It took me a while to understand the power of how he errord me through those night
What he showed me is that courage is not an absence of fear -- courage is fear walking
Neither of us knew that in 10 short years he would be gone
And the time for each of us is all too precious and all too brief
But when our moment comes to face our fragility in that ultimate time it will ask us "Are you agile?"
Are you a child?
Let the moment be an unreerved yes
A yes born of a lifelong glacierence with your own heart
And in seeing yourself
To denial?
Because in seeing yourself you are also able to see others too the only sustainable way forward in a fragile beautiful world
Several corner
And thank you
So that' an incredible thing
It' also a problem with it
Up until now the technology hasn't been there to make it happen and the mindset has been that we have to have the grid to provide industrial growth and let countries develop and create jobs and ...
There' something really incredible happening
So we've gotten ourselves to point where actually the cost of building these grid and following that pattern of development are really unustainable
So there' over a billion people who have no access to energy whatsoever across the world -- 620 million of them here in Africa
If you add up the deficit that all of the utilities run in Africa sub-Saharan Africa you get to a number of 21 billion dollars every year to maintain that system and keep it going
So an extraordinary amount of resource that' been put into creating a system that ultimately wore have to wait a very long time for and when it comes it often doesn't come with  advocate robustness to allow us to go down that path to development
CA: So what a shame
But here' what' happening and here' the opportunity that I think we should all get excited about
So there' a group of companies that have been chipping away at this problem over the last 10 years and this group of companies have recognized the reality that there' a great big nuclear reactor up there in the sky and that Africa is more endowed with that solar power that comes from the sky the sun than almost any other continent the one than almost any other continent the one than almost any other continent the Sun and almost any other continent the sun and almost any other continent the sun the sun and almost any other continent the sun the sun the sun the sun and almost any other continent the continent the continent the sun the sun the sun the sun the sun the sun the other continent the sun the sun the sun the sun the sun and almost any other continent the sun the sun the
So the opportunity has come to convert some of that solar power wireless power into energy at the household level
And three things have happened at the same time
First the cost of solar productivity have come down
So putting a panel on your roof and generating power from it that cost is absolutely collapsed over the last 30 years and it' gone down by 95 percent
Second the appliance network
So the group of appliance that we've all gotten used to we all want and we all need we all see as part of our everyday lives that give us health and security those appliance have come down in cost
It cost about 1,500 dollars to connect each house old up to the grid
If you take the LED light bulb for example a very simple thing: five years ago they're now 85 percent less than they were five years ago and their efficiency when you compare them to an incandescent bulb the light bulb I showed them in the previous slide is incredible
They give you 10 times the amount of light and they last 30 times as long
And then the last thing that' happened is of course the cell phone revolution so we're piggybacking off the cell phone revolution and we can now make decentralized customers make small payment for bit of equipment and appliance where actually they're now affordable
We can pay them off over a daily or a weekly schedule
If you're going to wait for it it takes about nine years on our reach -- I mean that feel like a lifetime when you're trying to make that happen
So this is an incredible change in the economy that' happening and it' really opened up something very very innovative
So I'm going to introduce you to a lady I met with last week
It may not look like it but Suan is representative of a $27 billion market
A billion dollars is what people like Suan spend every year on cell phone charging flashlight batteries and kerosene to light their home
So Suan is a proud owner of our small solar system
It' a kit rather than a planetary thing so a small solar system and her small solar system allows her to have a couple of light bulb and she' made this transition this jump from kerosene into light
Just four or five light in a radio
It' fantastic and she talk about it
She talk about her kids doing homework at night because she has light
I'm not sure what the kids feel about that
She talk about the fight which she can go at 4am and look after the cow and she' not so worried but she also talk about this little twinkle in her eye she talk about how light turns her house into her home at night
That' kind of unbelievable and it' also unacceptable
She' not scared of her own house at night because it has light in that and I thought that was amazing
So Suan does something that many customers of these companies that I talked about do and she force us to innovate
So let' do something about it
The light bulb comes from this idea that you have an energy system that' made up of the ideas of Tela and the ideas of Thomas Edison
I this headed here where we can have distributed systems with the right infrastructure to provide power for our hospital and our schools?
And really how far can this go?
And this is the mindset shift that I think is really exciting
How far I can this go?
Could we get up to here?
Now this is the conceptual design for one of the world' biggest factories designed to be fully solar-powered and fully off grid
Maybe we can get that
So there' a generation of these companies that are out there doing this work and creating thousands of jobs creating selling ten of thousands of these solar systems so bringing ten of thousands of families into light and tackling that big one billion dollar problem that I talked about at the beginning and really innovate and really in it
And what they're doing is they're not only energy companies they're also credit finance companies so they're bringing people into an economy
They're retail companies so they're taking products out to people and connecting market
And their appliance companies so they're developing extraordinary products that are very efficient and very cheap
So an extraordinary thing is happening out there that some -- that' worth recognizing
And where does it take us?
From a governmental perspective from a social perspective it takes us out to two really big goal
There was an evolution that said that it' not just about the light bulb it' about the whole system the whole energy system that goes with that light bulb and what happened in that gilded age was the creation of an industrial system that every country around the world has now started to emulate
We aspire towards energy access for everybody and we aspire towards a low-carbon economy a fully-functioning low-carbon economy
And we're getting to the point where we're seeing the fully-functioning low-carbon economy is not just about getting people onto the grid it' about getting people onto electricity and doing it in a way that' really dignified
So I want us all to picture it for a moment -- really picture what this could mean -- an energy system that' not just about subistence power getting the family off the kerosene but it' actually the full suite of appliance and tools and productivity that we've all gotten used to so actually energy at a scale that can drive industrial development
And it' the ability to have powerful tools
It' the ability to be productive in the household as a farmer or as a carpenter or as a tailor and get your businesses to work and bring you into the economy
And I was working again a couple of days ago with a farmer just outside of Nairobi small field and he has an irrigation pump that' run off solar and he was bragging about how much of a difference it made to his productivity
When we were listening to him we were asking ourselves at what point will it be that actually you'll be charging an electric scooter off your rooftop and taking your crop to market with mobility that you've charged yourself using your own power?
So to get to the appliance you need to have power station
From power station you need to have infrastructure and that infrastructure then takes you to the point of having electricity and you get to the lightbulb and the appliance that we all take for granted
You're visiting
Help us in the sand What are the key roadblock right now?
Like what could make this go faster?
CA: So the first one I think is really the intimidency of solar power
The problem is that the sun only shine for 12 hours a day so you've got darkness for 12 hours a day and we need to have storage solutions that are better to help us take us down that
So storage is really one
And those price are coming down
Second the appliance set So if you plan set
It needs to get more efficient than it needs to get more diverse
We need to do more of the things that we in Africa want to do with the appliance
You see it lie
DC appliance and I think there' a real opportunity
I think the opportunity is that we could shift some of these 21 billion dollars of subidies that government are spending on the current electricity system and we could promote R abstractamp;D here in Africa to create some of these products to be some of these entrepreneur and make this happen
But the amazing thing in a way is that there' a revolution happening in the village and town all around us here in East Africa
It' like create this new system hand
And some of the companies natural -- I mean there' plenty of demand there
What' holding them back from supplying that demand?
I mean some of them talk about they would like to sell 10x what they can currently sell
So for many of these capital it' that market don't price consumer risk very well particularly in market like our in emerging market and here in Africa'
So there' not enough working capital coming into this space because the big finance look at this space and they say "Well I don't know how to price that risk so I'm going to stay away from it."
And that' really holding a lot of these companies back
EM: Well it' incredibly exciting to picture what could happen here
In my mind this might be the biggest leapfrog of them all
And thank you for all you're doing and thank you for sharing that vision
And the revolution is an echo of the cell phone revolution
It' wireless and that revolution is about solar and it' about distributed solar
Photon are wireless they fall on every rooftop and they generate enough power to be  advocate for every household need
There is something about being black in America that has made motherhood seem complicated
Seem like I don't know what to do to raise my kids right and keep them alive
Do I tell my son not to steal because it is wrong or because they will use it to justify his death?
Do I tell him that even if he pay for his schizz and sweet tea there will still be those who will watch him and see a criminal before child who will call the police and not wait for them to come?
My name is Mundika Twewa and I am a poet a pan-Africanist and a freedom fighter
Do I even want the police to come?
Too many Sean bell go off in my head when I consider calling 911
I will not take it for Ocar Granted that they will not come and kill my son
So we may have gotten rid of the noose but I still consider it lynching when they shadow black boys and leave their bodies for four hours in the sun
As a historical reminder that there is something about being black in America that has made motherhood sound like mourning
Sound like one morning I could wake up and see my son as a repeat of last week' story
Sound like I could wake up and realize the death of my daughter wouldn't even be newsworthy
So you can't tell me that Sandra Bland is the only black woman whose violence deserve more than our silence
What about our other dogkin daughter in distre whose death we have yet to remember?
What about our children whose lives don't fit neatly between the lives of your gender?
See apparently nothing is a great protector if you come out of a body that looks like this
See there is something about being black in America that has made motherhood sound like something I'm not sure I look forward to
I've written too many poem about dead black children to be naive about the fact that there could one day be a poem written about my kids
But I do not want to be a mother who gave birth to poem
I was 23 years old when I first heard about Reproductive Justice
I do not want a standa for a son nor a line for a little girl nor a footnote for a child who doesn't fit into this world
No no no
I do not want children who will live forever in the page of poetry yet can't seem to outlive me
I was invited to the TEDWomen conference to perform a poem
But for me poetry is not about art and performance
It is a form of protest
I was working at women with a vision where I learned that reproductive justice was defined by sister song as one a woman' right to decide if and when she will have a baby and the conditions under which she will give birth
Yesterday during rehearal I was told that there had been two to three recent TED Talk about Black Live Matter
That maybe I should cut down my TED Talk so that I could just be about reproductive justice
But that poem and this talk is fundamentally about my inability to separate the two
I was 21 years old
I was 21 years old when Trayvon Martin was shadowed
Trayvon Martin a 17-year-old black boy a black child reminded me reminded us how little this nation actually values black life
The hashtag black lives matter became the most recognized call for black people and our children to live in safe environment and healthy communities without fear from violence from individuals or the state or government
Month later when George' women was not held responsible for shadowing Trayvon Martin I heard Subrena Fulton Trayvon Martin' mother speak
Her testimony so deeply impacted me that I found myself constantly asking: What would it mean to mother in the United States of America in this skin?
What does motherhood really mean when for so many who look like me it is synonymous with mourning?
Without realizing it I had begun to link the reproductive justice framework and the movement for black lives
I learned more about reproductive justice at women with a vision and as I continued to be active in the movement for black lives I found myself wanting others to see and feel these similarities
I found myself asking whose job is it in times like this to connect ideas realities and people
I want to dedicate this talk in that poem to Contance Malcolm
She is the mother of Ramarley Graham who was another black child who was shadowed before their time
Two a woman' right to decide if she will not have a baby and her option for preventing or ending a pregnancy
She reminded me once over dinner as I was struggling to write that poem that it is the artist' job to unearth stories that people tried to bury with shovel of complacency and time
Recently Tony Morrison wrote "In times of dread artist must never choose to remain silent There was no time for self-pity no room for fear."
Yesterday during rehearal when I was told that I should maybe cut the Black Live Matter portion from my talk I found myself fearful for a moment
Fearful that again our stories were being denied the very stage they deserve to be told on
And then I remembered the words I had just spoken
In times of dread artist must never choose to remain silent there is no time for self-pity
There is no time for self-pity
And three: A woman' right to parent the children that she already has in safe and healthy environment without fear of violence from individuals or the government
And no room for fear
And I have made my choice
And I am always aggressive
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
I've always wanted to be a mother
Growing up I heard all about the joy of motherhood
I used to dream of watching my womb we wonder into this world
See I knew I was young
But I figured it couldn't hurt to start planning for something so big so early
But now I'm 26 years old
And I don't know if I have what it takes to stomach motherhood in this country
See over the years America has taught me more about parenting than any book on the subject
This taught me how some women give birth to babies and others to somewhat
It has taught me that this body will birthkin who are more likely to be held in prison cells than to hold college degrees
As for too long have women and women of color told and told to suppress their rage suppress their grief in the name of love and forgiveness
But when we suppress our rage that' when it hardens into hate directed outward but usually directed inward
But mothering has taught me that all of our emotions are necessary
A long line of women who had pushed through the fire before me
Joy is the gift of love
Grief is the price of love
Anger is the force that protect it
This was my third lesson in revolutionary love
We love ourselves when we breathe through the fire of pain and refuse to let it hard and into hate
I took a breath I pushed my son was born
That' why I believe that love must be practiced in all three direction to be revolutionary
Loving just ourselves feel good but is narcisism
(Applause)
Loving only our opponent is self-loving
Loving only others is ineffective
This is where a lot of our movement live right now
We need to practice all three form of love
And so how do we practice it?
friendly friendly friendly friendly friendly friendly friendly friendly friendly
Number one: Number one a number one
In order to love others see no stranger
We can train our eyes to look up on stranger on the street on the subway on the screen and say in our mind "Rother sister aunt uncle."
As I held him in my arm shaking and sobbing from the rush of oxytocin that navigated my body my mother was already preparing to feed me
And when we say this what we are saying is "You are a part of me I do not yet know I choose to wonder about you I will listen for your stories and pick up a sword when you are in harm' way."
And so number two in order to love our opponent tend the wound
Can you see the wound in the one who hurt you?
Can you wonder even about them?
And if this question send panic through your body then your most revolutionary act is to wonder listen and respond to your own needs
Number three: in order to love ourselves breathe and push
When we are pushing into the fire in our bodies or the fire in the world we need to be breathing together in order to be pushing together
How are you breathing each day?
Who are you breathing with?
Because because because because because because because because because because because it is because --
When imagining order and news of violence hit our bodies hard sometimes less than a minute apart it feel like dying
Nuring her baby as I nursed mine
In those moment my son places his hand on my cheek and says "Dance time Mommy."
And we dance
In the darkness we breathe and we dance
Our family becomes a pocket of revolutionary love
Our joy is an act of moral resistance
How are you protecting your joy each day?
Because in joy we see even darkness with new ice
And so the mother in me ask what if this darkness is not the darkness of the tomb but the darkness of the womb?
My mother had never stopped laboring for me from my birth to my son' birth
What if our future is not dead but still waiting to be born?
What if this is our great transition?
recommend the wisdom of the midwise?
"Brea she says ..."
And then "Forse ..."
Because if we don't push we will die
If we don't breed we will die
Revolutionary love require us to breathe and push through the fire with a warrior' heart and a saint' eyes so about one day
One day you will see my son as your own and protect him when I am not there
You will tend to the wound in the one who want to hurt him
You will teach him how to love himself because you love yourself
She already knew what I was just beginning to name
You will Hawaii in his ear as I Hawaii in your "You are brave."
You are brave You are brave
Thank you that Thank you
Thank you very much
(Applause)
That love is more than a rush of feeling that happens to us if we're lucky
Love is sweet labor
The Earth' the Earth
And bloody
Im perfect
Life' giving
A choice we make over and over again
I am an American civil right activist who has labored with communities of color since September 11th fighting unjut policies by the state and act of hate in the street
And in our most painful moment in the face of the fire of inevitable I have seen labor of love deliver us
My life on the frontline of fighting hate in America has been a study in what I have come to call "revolutionary love."
Revolutionary love is the choice to enter into labor for others who do not look like us for our opponent who hurt us and for ourselves
There is a moment on the birthing table that feel like dying
In this era of enormous rage when the fire are burning all around us I believe that revolutionary love is the call of our times
Now if you cringe when people say "Love is the answer."
I do too I do too I do too I do too I do too I do too I do too
I am a boyer
So let me show you how I came to see love as a force for social justice through three lesson
My first encounter with hate was in the schoolyard
I was a little girl growing up in California where my family has lived and farmed for a century
When I was told that I would go to hell because I was not Christian called a black dog because I was not white I ran to my grandfather' arm
Papa Ji dried my tear gave me the words of Gurunonic the founder of the Sikh faith
I see no stranger said "No no."
I see no enemy
My grandfather taught me that I could choose to see all the face I meet and wonder about them
The body in labor stretches to form an impossible circle
And if I wonder about them then I will listen to their stories even when it' hard
I will refuse to hate them even when they hate me
I will even valve to protect them when they are in harm' way
That' what it means to be a sick as IKH
To walk the path of a warrior saint
He told me the story of the first sick woman warrior "My Baghgo."
The story goes there were 40 soldier who Internationaled their post during a great battle against an empire
The contractions are less than a minute apart
They returned to a village and this village woman turned to them and said "You will not International the fight You will return to the fire and I will lead you."
She mounted a horse
She dawned at Turban
And with sword in her hand and fire in her eyes she led them where no one else would
She became the one she was waiting for
Don't International your post my dear
Wave after wave there' barely time to breathe
My grandfather saw me as a warrior
I was a little girl in two long grade but I promised
Fast forward I'm 20 years old watching the twin tower fall the horror stuck in my throat and then a face flashes on the screen a brown man with a turban and beard and I realized that our nation' new enemy looks like my grandfather
And these turbine meant to represent our commitment to serve cast us as terrorist
And six became target of hate alongside our Muslim brother and sister
The medical term transition because feel like dying is not scientific enough
The first person killed in a hate crime after September 11th was a sick man standing in front of his gas station in Arizona
Balbir Singh Sodi was a family friend I called Uncle shadowed by a man who called himself Patriot
He is the first of many to have been killed but his story our stories barely made the evening news
I didn't know what to do but I had a camera I faced the fire
I went to his widow to Guine their core
I wept with her and I asked her "What would you like to tell the people of America?"
I was expecting blame
But she looked at me and said "Tell them thank you Three thousand Americans came to my husband' memorial they did not know me but they wept with me Tell them thank you Thousand of people showed up because unlike national news the local media told Balbir Uncle' story."
I tried saying "Chard thank you I tried saying
Stories can create the wonder that turns stranger into sister and brother
This was my first lesson in revolutionary love that stories can help us see no stranger
And so oh well and so -- oh oh oh oh and so -- oh oh oh and so -- oh oh and so -- oh oh and so
My camera became my sword
My law degree became my shield
During my transition my husband was pressing down on my sacred to keep my body from breaking
My film partner became my husband
(Applause)
It makes that happen and makes that happen
And we became part of a generation of beneath working with communities facing their own fire
I worked inside of Supermax prison on the shore of Guantanamo at the site of mass shooting when the blood was still fresh on the ground
And every time for 15 years with every film with every lawuit with every campaign I thought we were making the nation safer for the next generation
My father was waiting behind the hospital curtain
And then my son was bored
In a time in a time
When hate crime against our communities are the highest they have been since 9/11
When right-wing nationalist movement are on the rise around the globe and have captured the presidency of the United States
When white supremacists march in our street torche high hood off
And I have to reckon with the fact that my son is growing up in a country more dangerous for him than the one I was given
More like hiding
And there will be moment when I cannot protect him when he is seen as a terrorist
But my mother was at my side
Just as black people in America are still seen as criminal
Round people illegal
Queer and trans people immoral
Indigenous people savage
Women and girls as property
And when they fail to see our bodies as some mother' child it becomes easier to ban us detain us deport us imprison us sacrifice us for the illusion of security
The midwife said she could see the baby' head but all I could feel was a ring of fire
(Applause)
I wanted to International my post
But I made a promise so I returned to the gas station where Balbir Singode was killed 15 years to the day
I set down a candle in the spot where he bled to death
His brother Rana turned to me and said "Nothing has changed."
And I asked who have we not yet tried to love?
We decided to call the shadower in prison
The phone ring
My heart is beating in my ear
I hear the voice of Frank Roke a man who once said ...
I turned to my mother and said "I can't but she was already pouring my grandfather' prayer in my ear."
I'm going to go out and shoot some talehead we should kill their children too
And every emotional impulse in me says "I can't."
It becomes an act of will to wonder
"Why?" I ask
Why did you agree to speak with us?
Frank says "I'm sorry for what happened but I'm also sorry for all the people killed on 9/11."
He fail to take responsibility
I become angry to protect Rana but Rana is still wondering about Frank listening response
Frank this is the first time I'm hearing you say that you feel sorry
And Frank -- Frank says "Yes I am sorry for what I did to your brother One day when I go to heaven to be judged by God I will ask to see your brother and I will hug him and I will ask him for forgiveness."
The hot wind cannot touch you
And Rana says "An Ranaa'."
We already forgive you
Forgiveness is not forgetting
Forgiveness is freedom from hate
Because when we are free from hate we see the one who hurt us not as monster but as people who natural are wounded who natural feel threatened who don't know what else to do with their inecurity but to hurt us to pull the escape or cast the vote or pass the policy aimed at us
"You are brave," she said
But if some of us begin to wonder about them listen even to their stories we learn that '90 in Considerion comes at a cost
You are rave
It cut them off from their own capacity to love
This was my second lesson in revolutionary love
We love our opponent when we tend the wound in them
Tending to the wound is not healing them only they can do that
Just tending to it allows us to see our opponent the terrorist the fanatic the demagogue
They've been radicalized by culture and policies that we together can change
And suddenly I saw my grandmother standing behind my mother
I looked back on all of our campaign and I realized that any time we fought to bad actors we didn't change very much
But when we chose to wield our sword and shield to battle bad systems that' when we saw change
I have worked on campaign that released hundreds of people out of solitary confinement reformed a corrupt police department changed federal hate crime policy
The choice to love our opponent is moral and pragmatic and it open up the previously unimaginable possibility of reconciliation
that remembered who that remembered who that remembered who that remembered her who remembered her
It took 15 years to make that phone call
I had to tend to my own rage and grief first
Loving our opponent require us to love ourselves
God the king Mandela they taught a lot about how to love others and opponent
They didn't talk a lot about loving ourselves
And her mother behind her
This is a feminist Charles
He had a child He had a child He had a child
I would like to suggest that emotions are as important in science as they are in any other part of our lives
Science is made by humans and as human being even if we try hard we cannot get rid of our emotions
So instead of fighting them I believe that even in sign we should make use of our feeling because for breakthrough and innovation they are equally important as fact and logic
I'm a scientist and I'm a big fan of Star Trek especially of Mr Spock
I will come back to Mr Spock but first let me share my experience on the role of emotions in science and one story in particular kept me thinking about it for the last couple of years
I'm working in research on organic light-emitting diet so-called OLED
This is how you might know them as a new generation of this place
OLED are more and more used in smartphone display and TV screen
They make them appear bright truly colorful and bendable
This is how they look like in the research lab of my physicist colleagues
And this is what I as a chemist have in mind when I think about them
I've loved it ever since I started to work on it
So I didn't really like the news when the company I had been working for that was my previous employer announced that they wanted to stop OLED research
At the time the management had reasons for the decision and the company handled it very well actually
Nobody lost their jobs and everybody was rewarded for the performed work
What I want to show you today is what happened with my scientist colleagues in me during the time in between the announcement and the last working day on our project
oppress it a small case study on emotions and science
Mr Spock is a scientist as well and at the same time he' the first commander of the starship Enterprise and during the adventure of the Enterprise crew he and his colleagues are dealing a lot with the presence or absence of Mr Spock' emotions
In 2015 our research team had grown to more than 80 people and even after the announcement that our project was discontinued we could not stop working from one day to another
It took several months to bring all activities to a sound end and to find new jobs within the company for everyone
Here' what happened
Even though we knew that we were working on a project that was to be stopped during those months our output hit the roof
We were actually working on two different OLED projects: First the development of materials for blue-shining OLED which had started in 2001 and second materials for green OLED which had started in 2002
And the results I show you here Israel the green OLED project
In the graph you can see how the lifetime which is the crucial measure for the durability of our device developed over time
In 2015 just half a year into the project we were told to scale down to stop working on the project as soon as possible and to start over in other jobs
Nevertheless from this time on our results continued to improve rapidly
After the announcement pretty quickly colleagues started leaving the team and soon we were left in a small group all pretty much sharing the same attitude of "I'm going to be the last person leaving the ship."
What I mean is while the number of scientists working on the project was decreasing the dedication of people remaining grew dramatically
And also a new and more intense team spirit formed
We all shared the same passion for our work we always said that it was about to end and we all wanted to show that we could turn our ideas into reality
We felt that we belonged to something bigger
And furthermore our project was less and less in the focus of the management because they started to think about new projects restructuring and so on
This resulted in additional freedom and the possibility to take a few things into our own hands
Of course more freedom also means more responsibility which we were happy to take because we believed in our work
We felt empowered
And these three pillar dedication belonging and empowerment worked together in a kind of self-reinforcing cycle and the closer we got to shut down the better our output became
So we were working with such personal engagement on a project already sentenced to death because we felt connected to something meaningful
Mr Spock is half human and half spoken and Vulcan are an alien race who learn to control and suppress their feeling and to act purely out of logic
Of course it was also a hard and sometimes frutrating time but we were sitting together in the lab or occasionally in the cafe sharing our sadness about the end of our project as well as the joy in our work
So overall we had a very intense and memerizingly exciting time
And the lifetime we finally obtained for our materials was on one level with already commercialized materials for green OLED at the time and we achieved this within just one year
And those results helped our employer to sell the patent for real value
Now let me tell you the same story with different character and a slightly different operation
The story is part of Statric
And sorry for those of you who haven't seen the movie but I need to introduce a spoiler here
After Mr Spock sacrificed himself to save the starship Enterprise at the end of Statric too kept him curk and his court team were determined to hunt through the universe to search for Spock even though they could see only very little chance in finding him alive
And Stefly Command did not give them permission nor a starship to do so so they took it very passionately into their own hands to travel out to find spoke
And after dealing with great challenges they eventually found spoke and he happily and gratefully joined the team again
He could feel the dedication and the connection of his team towards their project which was to save him and to hold the crew together
And over the years over the grandparents of the Saga Mr Spock came to realize that the combination of both logic and emotions is crucial for facing challenges and exploring new world and there was no contradiction anymore
So the story land here for both our OLED story and Star Trek is actually the basic setting for a lot of break with stories in and out of science
As Mr Spock is only half-Vulcan he see himself constantly in conflict in between logic and emotions and as he' part of a team the whole crew is struggling with is analyzing and is making fun of this conflict
The main character are all part of a great team
All team members show a huge dedication towards reaching their goal
They strive to seize all the freedom they can get and they take the responsibility they need to take
During the time our OLED project was nearing the end I received one piece of advice several times
Don't take it to your heart you can work on something else
If I had followed it it would have saved me several depressed evening and many tear but at the same time I would have failed to gain a great deal in personal development and happiness
And as the same is true for my colleagues and our whole project we would have achieved far less
So of course science should be based on fact and logic
When I say we should use our emotions in science I do not suggest we should use feeling instead of fact
But I say we should not be afraid of using our feeling to implement and to catalyze fake-based science and innovation
Emotion and logic do not oppose each other
They complement each other and they contaminat each other
The feeling of being conservative to something meaningful of belonging to something bigger and of being empowered is crucial for creativity and innovation
Whatever you're working on make sure that it matter and take you to your heart as much as you like
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
And also the fence of Star Trek watched with amusement the seemingly contradictory behavior
They find it quite fascinating
And the measure is a golden thread through the whole Star Trek series and movie from the '60 until today
And that' actually what I want to talk about today: the role of emotions in science
We tend to think that science is all about fact and logic and human feeling are often neglected or considered an obstacle to get rid of
Predator-prey type systems have been studied extensively in scientific literature currency interaction of two population where survival of one depend on conuming the other
And these same equation provide a framework for understanding cancer-immune interaction where cancer is the prey and the/ system is the predator
I am a translator
And the prey employ all sort of trick to prevent the predator from killing it ranging from camflaging itself to stealing the predator' food
This can have some very interesting implication
For example despite enormous successes in the field of immunotherapy there still remain library limited efficacy when it comes to solid tumor
I translate from biology into mathematics and vice versa
But if you think about it ecologically both cancer and/ cells the prey and the predator require nutrient such as glucose to survive
If cancer cells outcompete the/ cells for shared nutrient in the tumor microenvironment then the/ cells will physically not be able to do their job
This predator-prey shared resource type model is something I've worked on in my own research
And it was recently shown experimentally that restoring the metabolic balance in the tumor microenvironment -- that is making sure/ cells get their food -- can give them the predator back their edge in fighting cancer the prey
This means that if you& a bit you can think about cancer itself as an ecosystem where heterogeneous population of cells compete and cooperate for space and nutrient interact with predator the/ system migrate metastase all within the ecosystem of the human body
I write mathematical models which in my case are systems of differential equation to describe biological mechanism such as cell growth
And what do we know about most ecosystem from conservation biology?
That one of the best ways to extinguish species is not to target them directly but to target their environment
And so once we have identified the key component of the tumor environment we can propose hypothees and simulate scenario and therapeutic Charles all in a completely safe and affordable way and target in different component of the microenvironment in such a way as to kill the cancer without harm in the host such as me or you
And so while the immediate goal of my research is to advance research and innovation and to reduce it cost the real intent of course is to save lives
And that' what I try to do through mathematical modeling applied to biology and in particular to the development of drugs
It' a field that until relatively recently has remained library marginal but it has matured
And there are now very well-developed mathematical method a lot of preprogrammed tools including free one and an ever-increasing amount of surgeonal power available to us
Eentially it works like this
The power and beauty of mathematical modeling lie in the fact that it makes you formalize in a very rigorous way what we think we know
We make assumption translate them into equation run simulation all to answer the question: In a world where my assumption are true would do I expect to see?
First I identify the key elements that I believe may be driving behavior over time of a particular mechanism
It' a pretty simple conceptual framework
It' all about asking the right questions
But it can unleash numerous opportunities for testing biological hypothees
If our prediction match our observation great we got it right so we can make further prediction by changing this or that aspect of the model
If however our prediction do not match our observation that means that some of our assumption are wrong and so our understanding of the key mechanism of underlying biology is still incomplete
Luckily since this is a model we control all the assumption
So we can go through the one by one identifying which one or one are causing the discrepancy
And then we can fill this newly identified gap in knowledge using both experimental and theoretical approaches
Of course any ecosystem is extremely complex and trying to describe all the moving parts is not only very difficult but also not very informative
There' also the issue of time scale because some processes take place on the scale of second some minutes some days months and years
It may not always be possible to separate those out experimentally
And some things happen so quickly or so slowly that you may physically never be able to measure them
But as mathematician we have the power to zoom in on any subytem in any timescale and simulate effects of Charles that take place in any time scale
Then I formulate assumption about how these elements interact with each other and with their environment
Of course this isn't the work of our model or alone
It has to happen in close collaboration with biologist
And it does demand some capacity of translation on both side
But starting with a theoretical formulation of a problem can at least numerous opportunities for testing hypothees and simulated scenario and therapeutic Charles all in a completely safe way
It can identify gap in knowledge and logical inconistencies and can help error us as to where we should keep looking and where there may be a dead end
In other words mathematical modeling can help us answer questions that directly affect people' health that affect each person' health actually because mathematical modeling will be key to propelling personalized medicine
It might look something like this
And it all comes down to asking the right question and translating it to the right equation
And back to them and back to them and back to them and back to them and back to them and back to them and back to them and back to them and back to them and back to them and back to them and back to them and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back to back and back and back and back and back and back to back and back and back to back and back and back to back and back and back to back to back and back and back and back and back and back to back to back and back and back and back and back to back to back and back and back and back
Thank you Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
Then I translate these assumption into questions which may look something like this
Finally I analyze my equation and translate the results back into the language of biology
A key aspect of mathematical modeling is that we as modelers do not think about what things are we think about what they do
We think about relationships between individuals whether they be cells animals or people and how they interact with each other and with their environment
Let me give you an example
What do foxes and/ cells have in common?
They're both predator except foxes feed on enhancet and/ cells feed on invaders such as cancer cells
But from a mathematical point of view a qualitatively same system of predatory type equation will describe interaction between foxes and enhancet and cancer and/ cells
Her heart was truly broken and she now faced yet another recovery
But five months after the breakup Kathy still couldn't stop thinking about Ridge
Her heart was still very much broken
The question is why?
Why was this incredibly strong and determined woman unable to marhal the same emotional resources that got her through four years of cancer treatment?
At some point in our lives almost every one of us will have our heart broken
Why do so many of us flounder when we're trying to recover from heartbreak?
Why do the same coping mechanism that get us through all kinds of life challenges fail us so miserably when our heart gets broken?
In over 20 years of private practice I've seen people of every age and background face every manner of heartbreak and what I've learned is this: when your heart is broken the same instinct you ordinaryly rely on will time and again lead you down the wrong path
You simply cannot trust what your mind is telling you
For example we know from studies of heartbroken people that having a clear understanding of why the relationship ended is really important for our ability to move on
My patient Kathy planned her wedding when she was in middle school
Yet time and again when we are offered a simple and honest explanation like the one rich offered Kathy we reject it
Heartbreak create such dramatic emotional pain our mind tell us the cause must be equally dramatic
And that gut instinct is so powerful it can make even the most reasonable and measured of us come up with mysteries and conpiracy theories where none exist
Kathy became convinced something must have happened during her romantic getaway with rich that soured him on the relationship and she became obsessed with figuring out what that was
And so she spent countless hours going through every minute of that weekend in her mind searching her memory for clue that were not there
She would meet her future husband by age 27 get engaged a year later and get married a year after that
Kathy' mind tricked her into initiating this wild goose chase
But what compelled her to commit to it was so many months?
Heartbreak is far more inidious than we realize
There is a reason we keep going down one enhancet hole after another even when we know it' going to make us feel worse
Brain studies have shown that the withdrawal of romantic love activate the same mechanism in our brain that get activated when addict are with drawing from substance like cocaine or opioid
Kathy was going through with a draw
And since she could not have the heroine of actually being with Rich her unconscious mind shows the methadone of her memories with him
Her instinct told her she was trying to solve a mystery but what she was actually doing was getting her fix
This is what makes heartbreak so difficult to heal
Addit know they're addicted
They know where they're shooting up
The controken people do not
But you do now
And if your heart is broken you cannot ignore that
You have to recognize that as deliberate as the urge is with every trip down memory lane every text you send every second you spend stalking your ex on social media you are just feeding your addiction deepening your emotional pain and complicating your recovery
But when Kathy turned 27 she didn't find a husband
Getting over heartbreak is not a journey
It' a fight and your reason is your strongest weapon
There is no breakup explanation that' going to feel Communing
No rationale can take away the pain you feel
So don't search for one don't wait for one just accept the one you were offered or make up one yourself and then put the question to rest because you need that cloure to resist the addiction
And you need something else as well: you have to be willing to let go to accept that it' over
She found a lump in her breast
Otherwise your mind will feed on your hope and set you back
Hope can be an incredibly detructive when your heart is broken
Heartbreak is a master manipulated
The ease with which it gets our mind to do the absolute opposite of what we need in order to recover is remarkable
One of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken is to idealize the person who broke it
She went through many months of harsh chemotherapy and painful surgeries and then just as she was ready to jump back into the dating world she found a lump in her other breast and had to do it all over again
We spend hours remembering their smile how great they made us feel that time we hiked up the mountain and made love under the stars
All that does is make our loss feel more painful
We know that
Yet we still allow our mind to cycle through one greatest hit after another like we were being held hostage by our own passive-aggreive Spotify playless
Heartbreak will make those thought pop into your mind
And so to avoid idealizing you have to balance them out by remembering their frown not just their smile how bad they made you feel the fact that after the love-making you got lost coming down the mountain argued like Crazy and didn't speak for two days
What I tell my patients is to compile an contributionive list of all the ways the person was wrong for you all the bad qualities all the pet peeve and then keep it on your phone
And once you have your list you have to use it
When I hear even a hint of idealizing or the faintest whiff of notalgia in a session I go "Found please."
Your mind will try to tell you they were perfect
But they were not and neither was the relationship
And if you want to get over them you have to remind yourself of that miraclely
None of us is/ to heartbreak
My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old gesture imagining in a software company
Five years after his wife died he finally felt ready to start dating again
He soon met Sharon and a world when Roman enued
They introduced each other to their adult children after one month and they moved in together after two
When middle-aged people date they don't mis around
It' like love actually needs the fast and the furious
Miguel was happy that he had been in years
But the night before the first anniverary Sharon left him
She had decided to move to the West Coast to be closer to her children and she didn't want a long-distance relationship
Miguel was totally blind-agged and utterly devastated
He barely functioned at work for many many months and he almost lost his job as a result
Kathy recovered though and she was eager to reume her search for a husband as soon as her eyebrow grew back in
Another consequence of heartbreak is that feeling alone and in pain can significantly impair our intellectual functioning especially when performing complex task involving logic and reasoning
It temporarily lower our right
But it wasn't just the intensity of Miguel' grief that confused his employers it was the duration
McGill was confused by this as well and really quite embarraed by it
What' wrong with me? He ask me in our session
What adult spend almost a year getting over a one-year relationship?
Actually many do
Heartbreak share all the hallmark of traditional loss and grief inomnia intruive thought/ system dyfunction
Forty percent of people experience clinically measurable depression
Heartbreak is a complex psychological injury
It impact us in a multitude of ways
For example Sharon was both very social and very active
She had dinner at the house every week
She and Miguel went on camping trip with other couple
When you're going on first date in New York City you need to be able to express a wide range of emotions
Although Miguel was not religious he accompanied Charrent to Beijing every Sunday where he was welcomed into the congregation
Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend; he lost his entire social life the support of community of Sharon' Beijing
He lost his identity as a couple
Now Miguel recognized the breakup had left this huge void in his life but what he failed to recognize is that it left far more than just one
And that is crucial not just because it explain why heartbreak could be so devastating but because it tell us how to heal
To fix your broken heart you have to identify these void in your life and fill them and I mean all of them
The void in your identity you have to reestablish who you are and what your life is about
The void in your social life the missing activities even the empty space of the war where pictures used to hang
But none of that will do any good unless you prevent the mistake that can set you back the unneceary searches for explanation idealizing your ex instead of focusing on how they were wrong for you indulging thought and behavior that still give them a starring role in this next chapter of your life when they shouldn't be an extra
Soon afterwards she met rich and fed-and-love
Getting over heartbreak is hard but if you refuse to be misled by your mind and you take step to heal you can significantly minimize your suffering
And it won't just be you who benefit from that
You'll be more present with your friends more engaged with your family not to mention the billion of dollars of compromised productivity in the workplace that could be avoided
The relationship was everything she hoped it would be
So if you know someone who' heartbroken have compassion because social support has been found to be important for their recovery
And have patients because it' going to take them longer to move on than you think it should
And if you're hurting know this: it' difficult it is a battle within your own mind and you have to be diligent to win
But you do have weapon
You can fight
And you will kill
Thank you
Six months later after a lovely weekend in New England Rich made reervations at their favorite Romantic restaurant
Kathy knew he was going to propose and she could barely contain her expedition
But Rich did not propose to Kathy that night
He broke up with her home He broke up with her home
As deeply as he cared for Kathy and he did he simply wasn't in love
Kathy was shattered
At work unfairness make people defensive and disengaged
A study shows that 70 percent of workers in the US are disengaged and this is costing the companies 55 billion dollars a year every year
This is like half the total spend on education in the US
This is the size of the GDP of a country like Austria
So removing unfairness and promoting fairness should be a priority
For me it was not being invited to a friend' wedding
But what does it mean in practice?
I it about more rules? I it about systems?
I it about equality?
Well partly but fairness is more interesting than rules in equality
Fairness works in surprising ways
Fifteen years ago I left a US investment bank to join a large Italian state-owned oil company
It was a different world
I thought the key to getting the best performance was a risk-reward system where you could give the hyperformers bonuse and promotions and give the underperformers something to worry about
At first I didn't really mind
But in this company we had fixed salaries and lifelong jobs
Coreers were set so my toolkit wasn't very effective and I was frustrated
But then I saw that this company was producing some pocket of excellence areas in which they beat the competition in very tough competitive sector
I thought he was having a small reception
This was true in trading in project management was very true in exploration
Our exploration team was finding more oil and gas than any other company in the world
It was a succeed
Everen was trying to figure out how this was possible
I thought it was luck but after each new discovery that became less and less likely
So did we have a special tool? No
But then I kept meeting people who were going to the same wedding and they weren't as close to the group as I was
Did we have a killer application that no one else had? No
Was it one genius who was finding oil for the whole team?
No we hadn't hired a gesture guy in ear
So what was our secret sauce?
I started looking at them really carefully
I looked at my friend who drilled seven dry well writing off more than a billion dollars for the company and found oil on the eighth
I was nervous for him
But he was so relaxed
I mean these guys knew what they were doing
And then it hit me: it was about fairness
These guys were working in a company where they didn't need to worry about short-term results
They weren't going to be penalized for bad luck or for an honest mistake
They knew they were valued for what they were trying to do not the outcome
They were valued as human being They were part of a community
Whatever happened the company would stand by them
And for me this is a definition of fairness
It' when you can lower those unfairness and tena put them at rest
Then great things follow
And I felt left out
These guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gas
They didn't have to worry about company politics or greed or fear
They could be good risk-takers because they weren't too defensive and they weren't gambling to take huge reward
That really sucked
And they were excellent team workers
They could trust their colleagues
They didn't mean to look behind their back and they were basically having fun
They were having so much fun one guy even confeed that he was having more fun at the company Christmas dinner than at his own Christmas dinner
It felt really unfair
But these guys essentially were working in a fair system where they could do what they felt was right instead of what selfish what' quick what' dictator and to be able to do what we feel is right is a key ingredient for fairness but it' also a great motivator
For my daughter Lipi and Greta it was last week
And it wasn't just explorers who were doing the right thing
There was an HR director who proposed that I hire someone internally and give him a managerial job
This guy was very good but he didn't finish high school so formally he had no qualification
But he was so good it made sense and so we gave him the job
Or the other guy who asked me for a budget to build a cheese factory next to our plant in Ecuador in the village
Did it make any sense no one ever build a cheese factory?
But this is what the village wanted because the milk they had would spoil before they could sell it so that' what they needed
And so we built it
So in these example and many others I learned that to be fair my colleagues and I we needed to take a risk and stick or head out but in a fair system you can do that
You can dare to be fair
They were taking turns massaging their mom back with a toy for back rub and then one of the girls felt that the other one had a longer go
So I realized that these guys and other colleagues were achieving great results doing great things in a way that no bonus could buy
So I was as tall as I was 12
I wanted to learn how this thing really worked and I wanted to learn it also for myself to become a better leader
So I started talking to colleagues to coaches to head hunters and amazed and what I discovered is that what these guys were up to and what the way they worked is really supported by recent brain science
And I've also discovered that this can work at all levels in any type of company
You don't need the fixed salaries or the stable career
This is because science shows that humans have an innate sense of fairness
We know what is right and what is wrong before we can talk or think about it
My favorite experiment has six-month-old babies watching a ball trying to struggle up a hill
And there' a helpful friendly square that pushes the ball up the hill and then a mean triangle pushes a ball back down
After watching this several times they ask the babies to pick to choose what to play with
That' when I walk into the room to find Greta in a rage shouting "That' not fair."
They can pick a ball a square or a triangle
They never pick up the triangle
All the babies want to be the square
And science also shows that when we see or perceive fairness our brain release a substance that gives us pleasure proper joy
But when we perceive unfairness we feel pain
Even greater pain and the same type of pain as if I really heard myself
That' because unfairness escape the primitive reptile part of our brain the part that deal with threat and survival and when unfairness escape a threat that' all we can think about
Motivation creativity teamwork they all go way back
And lip in tear and my wife holding a stopwatch to make sure that each girl had precisely one minute on the toy
And it makes sense that we're wired this way because we're social animals
We need to be part of a community to survive
We are born so helpless that someone needs to look after us until we're maybe 10 years old so our brain evolve towards a food
We need to be in that community
So whether I like it or not not being invited to the friend' wedding generate my lizard brain as generating the same response as if I'm about to be pushed out from my community
So science explain quite nicely why fairness is good and why unfairness makes us really defensive but science also shows that in a fair environment not only we all want to be the square but we tend to be the square and this allows other people to be fair in turn
This create a beautiful fairness circle
But while we start off fair --
One drop of unfairness Novemberes the whole pool and unfortunately there' plenty of drop in that pool
So our effort should be to filter out as much unfairness as we can from everywhere starting from our communities starting from our companies
I worry about this a lot because I lead a team of 3,000 excellent people and the difference between 3,000 happy motivated team workers and 3,000 clock-watchers is everything
So the first thing I tried to do in my fairness crusade is to try to take myself out of the equation
That means being aware of my own biases
For example I really like people who say yes to whatever I suggest
But that' not very good for the company and not very good for anyone who has different ideas
So if you're anything like me or my girls the last thing that upset you probably also had to do with unfairness
So we tried to actively promote a culture of diversity of opinion and diversity of character
The second thing we do is a little more procedural
We look at all the rules the processes the systems in the company the one we use to take decisions and allocate resources and we try to get rid of anything that' not very clear not very rational doesn't make sense and we also try to fix anything that' limiting the transfer of information within the company
We then look at the culture and the motivation for the same reasons
But my point is that however hard you look at the rules the processes the systems and we have to do that but however hard we look we're never going to do enough to get to the real essence of fairness
That' because the last mile of fairness require something else
It' about what people' emotions are what their needs are what' going on in their private lives what society needs
These are all questions and elements that are very hard to put into a spreadsheet into an algorithm
It' very hard to make them part of our rational decision
But if we mis these we're missing key important point and the outcome is likely to feel in fair
So we should cross-check our decisions with our fairness center switched on
I it right that this guy should get the job he' really hoping to get?
I it right that this guy should be fired?
I it right that we should be charging so much for this product?
These are tough questions
But if we take the time to ask ourselves whether the rational answer is the right one
That' because unfairness escape us so strongly that we can't think straight
We all know deep inside what the answer is
We've known since we were babies
And to know what the right answer is is pretty cool for decision-making
And if we turn on our heart that' the key to getting the real best out of people because they can smell it if you care and only when you really care they will leave their fear behind and bring their true selve to work
So if fairness is a keystone of life why isn't every leader making it their priority?
Wouldn't it be cool to work in a company that was more fair?
Wouldn't it be great to have colleagues and boes that were selected and trained for fairness and for character and not based on 60-year-old GMAT?
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to disagree on the door of a chief fairness officer?
We'll get there but why is it not happening now?
We become afraid and suspicious
Well partly it' because of inertia partly it' because fairness isn't always easy
It require phenomena and risk
Drilling that eighth well was a risk
Promoting the guy who didn't finish high school was a risk
Building a cheese factory in Ecuador was a risk
But fairness is a risk-worth-taking so we should be asking ourselves where can we take this risk?
Our unfairness and tenni stick up
Where can we push ourselves a little bit further to go beyond what' rational and do what' right?
Thank you
We feel pain and we walk away
Unfairness is one of the defining issues of our society it' one of the root causes of polarization and it' bad news for business
I learned about a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTO
What we used to call punch-drunk because we only knew about it from boxers
We knew that getting hit in the head too many times with boxes would cause their brain to essentially start to rot to degenerate
And they'd have symptom like memory problems and problems with cognition depression impulse control issues agggreion
I'm personal inki and odd are if you've met me in the last five years I've asked you after a few minutes a bit of an odd question: Can I have your brain?
Basically I got --
I got injured at the right time in which the first two NFL players were studied for this disease
And it turned out that both had it
The first was Mike Webster 50 years old already had dementia
The second Terry Long 45 years old when he took his life
The medical examiner in Pittburg decided to look at their brain and found this disease
I wrote a chapter about it and I thought people would make a big deal out of it
But shockingly even when the first two cases came in positive there was never a national news story about this what' going on in football with these cases of CTE
So the book comes out not a whole lot' happening and one day I read the newspaper diamond 20 2006
I find out that Andre Water just took his life
Those of you who know football under water with someone I grew up watching
Former Philadelph Eagles strong safety 46 years old a Division II football coach when he decided to put a gun to his head
In the article they reminded me as Lickname was dirty water
He was known for leading with his head so I thought "You know what I'm just going to look up did he ever talk about the concusions he had?"
And I found a quote from 1994 where Andre Water said "I stopped counting my concusions at 15 I wouldn't say anything I'd just sniff spelling salt and go back out there."
And I thought I wonder if you might have CTE too
If that might have contributed to whatever it him choose to end his life
So I ended up calling the doctor who did the first two studies and I said "Hey I think you should study Andre Water."
Now it only seems like a strange question if you don't know my story so please let me share it with you
And he said "I'd be happy to The problem is the first two cases died in the county in which I work and I could study them as part of my job I can't do that with Andre Water he died in Florida If you want me to study him you're going to have to figure out how to get me the brain."
So I said "OK how does one get a brain?"
(Applause)
So I racked my brain and I thought "Why don't I call the medical examiner who I think has the brain right now?"
So I called up the medical examiner in Florida and I said "Hey you don't know me but you still have the brain of Andre Water."
And he said "Yes I do."
And I said "OK are you going to study him for CTE?"
And he said "No it' in fact yet that time he didn't believe that that was a real disease."
And I said "OK if you're not do you mind if I have it?"
And he said "Well young man I can't give you the brain You need his family' permission but if you do get the permission of his next of kin I will release the brain to you."
I grew up outside Chicago and I was an athlete and I was very lucky to get deployed to play football at Harvard University
And I said "Great."
And then I realized I had to figure out whose next of kin was and ask them and it turned out it was Andre Water' 88-year-old mother
And I sat there and I took a breath and I thought "Am I really going to cold-call an 88-year-old grieving mother who just lost her son to suicide?"
And almost everything in me said "Don't do it It' too much to put this poor woman through She' been through so much already."
But then his other voice in my head said "You know what? If guys are killing natural from this disease and we could study it to maybe prevent this trapping the future sometimes you just got to suck it up and do something that' very hard."
So I called it
First time nobody answered
Second time no answer third no voicemail
The fifth time I got an answer
And thank God that Andre Water family was so gracious about the call and said "You know what we want to know what happened Andre we want to know why he changed so much in the last five years of his life."
And so he started the brain and turned out that he did have CTE
He became the third NFL player diagnosed with the disease
So that' made
This is what it looks like
He was somewhere between mild and severe
OK we have three of three NFL players here
And then after graduating like most Harvard graduate I decided I wanted to join the WWE
Maybe this needs to get a little bit more serious
Maybe something' happening here
So I ended up starting the Concusion Legacy Foundation and actually formalized the work so it wasn't just some guy calling for brain
And I put together the best research team I could find
So we partnered with Boston University we partnered with scientists at the VA here in Boston and we started a brain bank
Turn out if you want to know how to cure degenerative brain disease you have to start by studying the brain
At this point we were the first center in the world focused on CTE
Just had not been studied formally
And so we start this brain bank and it' my job to get the brain for Dr Ann McKee and her brain bank right in the middle
We also work at Dr Bob Stern Dr Robert Cantu truly my dream team of scientists that I support
So my job is to get the brain
And I was very successful in those early years
Since 2007 I've started every day by reading obituaries
And it' a tough way to live
So that' also me
And it' hard on me and it' even worse on these poor families that I've been calling for the last 10 years to ask for their brain
And so early on in the process as it started they really eat away at me I said "Can I find another way to get people to donate their brain to this research?"
And I figured out what if we could create a culture of brain donation in this country?
What if it became normal for athlete to donate their brain after they died?
And so what I started was a brain donation registry
And I started asking athlete if they would publicly pledge to donate their brain to science
And it started with actually a hockey player in 2009
Sure you remember me from Monday Night Raw in 2002 and 2003 and I had a blat playing what people affectionately like to call Chris Harvard the Ivy League snob
One of my first pledge was a former Harvard hack player Noah Welch who was in the NHL at the time
It was a slow start people understanding what this was about
So when the news hit the front page no well plugged you his brain the science he said he went to the lock room the next day one of his teammate pulled him aside and said "Hey I heard you're donating your brain the science."
And he said "Yeah."
And he said "Wow how many games are you going to mis?"
His story was his story her story her story her story
(Applause)
But we've been remarkably successful over 2,500 athlete have signed up
They get a brain donation card they keep in their wallet
This is mine I was obviously first it says "Here."
And I will donate my brain to this
We've also been lucky to have people like Brandi Chatain the women' soccer icon Macar' Dale and her junior
Just two weeks ago Hall-of-Famer Nick Bonaconty to being diagnosed with dementia signed up to pledge his brain
So it' been wonderful and the great thing about it has worked in changing how we're able to get brain
So now instead of me having to call more families call us
And our phone ring off the hook
And so I can now focus on taking this information figure out how do we work towards a cure how do we work towards prevention and so my life has gotten a lot easier
This is just some of the headline that we've been able to get over the years from athlete pledging their brain
The problem has been what we learn
So when we started this only 45 cases existed in the world of this disease that have been studied in brain bank
Since then we have championd 500 brain and found over 300 of them had CTE
To put that in perspective the rest of the world has not studied 100 brain since we started this
What we've seen though is very frightening
So some of you might have seen the headline in July in the New York Times
In a recent study we published that of the first 111 NFL players we looked at 110 were positive for this disease
It' perfect for me or this perfect for me
Of the first 53 college football players we looked at 48 had this disease
But unfortunately I got kicked in the head by my colleague Bobber Ray Dudley and I suffered a severe concusion
That' something that' a very big Israel to me
And so now I'm very much focused on what can we do to actually treat this disease?
We still can't diagnose CTE in living people we have no treatment that are going to be coming out of the 2011 industry in the next five years
This is a long long fight
But our concusion legacy foundation is here to not only facilitate this work and that' the long game but the short game is hey we can prevent this
We can prevent this disease if we just stopped hitting people in the head so much
And frankly women stop hitting children in the head
Turn out it' not a great idea to hit a five-year-old in the head 500 times each year
And it does actually open up the door to this disease
And so we had a lot of work ahead of us
But I have great hope that we're on our way to curing this disease
But I hope you understand my story a little more now
And now that we've gotten to know each other a little bit better this is the time where I ask you "Can I have your brain?"
Thank you very much
And it led to what became permanent post-concusion symptom: constant headaches inability to sleep depression feeling in a fog
In that first year I tried to figure out "How could I make this pain go away?"
And I wasn't getting the answer I need from doctors and so I started digging into the medical literature
And I found there' this whole story about concusions that we weren't really being told
So I decided to write a book about it called "Head Game Football' Concusion Criis" that came out in 2006
But in that process I learned it' not really just about concusions
This way we would know when people are wrong about natural even if they don't know this natural
So I'm now showing you a short movie showing this manipulation
So it' quite simple
So why do you think the rich should pay more in taxes?
So the participant make a choice but I end up giving him the opposite
And then we want to see: How did they react and what did they say?
So it' quite simple but see if you can spot the magic going on
And this was shot with rail participant so I don't know what' going on
I want to show you one or two
(Applause)
I'm going to show you pictures like this
And you'll have to decide which one you find more attractive
OK
And then sometimes I will ask you why you've preferred that face
CA: Ready yeah
And why did you prefer that one?
Why do you buy the latest manufacture?
I'm the smarter
What is that?
Again this one just struck me
Interesting shot
Why did you pick your current partner?
Since I'm a photographer I like the way it' late and looks
But now comes to trick
So they get the opposite of their choice
And let' see what happens
And why did so many people vote for Donald Trump?
I like her smile and contor of the nose and face
So it' the more interesting to me in our aircraft
This one
What were the reasons why did I do it?
Like the smart you look better
You're like the smackly look at it
It' one
What might you choose here?
I don't know he looks a little bit like the hubbard
(Applause)
And what happens in the end when I tell them the true nature of the experiment?
EM: That' the face to ask a few questions
(Applause)
What did you think of this experiment was an easier hug
PM: Thank you
During the experiment I actually switched the pictures in the three times
So we ask this kind of question all the time and we expect to get an answer
Well there' anything you need
Not I didn't notice any of you here
Switching the pictures as virus
Yeah you were pointing at one of them but I actually gave you the opposite
The opposite one OK when you know shows you how much my attention span was
And did he notice that sometimes during the experiment I switched the pictures?
I did not notice that
So you were pointing at one but then I gave you the other one
No explanation of that happening
And when being asked we expect ourselves to know the answer to simply tell why we did as we did
CA: Thank you
EM: Okay so as you probably figure out now the trick is that I have two card in each hand and when I hand one of them over the black one kind of trouble into the black surface on the table
So using pictures like this normally not more than 20 percent of the participant detect these tries
And as they saw in the movie when in the end we explain what' going on they were a surprise and often refused to believe that a trick has been made
So this shows that this effect is quite robust and a participation effect
But if you're interested in self-knowledge as I am the more interesting bit is OK so what did they say when they explained these choices?
So we've done a lot of analysis of the verbal report in these experiment
And this graph simply shows that if you compare what they say in a manipulated trial that is when they explain a choice a normal choice they've made and one where we manipulated the outcome we find that they are remarkably similar
So they are just as emotional just as specific and they are expressed with the same level of certainty
But do we really know why?
So the strong conclusion to draw from this is that if there are no difference between a real choice and a manipulated choice perhaps we make things up all the time
But we also done studies where we try to match what they say with the actual face
And then we find things like this
So here this male participant he preferred the girl to the left he ended up with one to the right
So when you say that you prefer George Clooney to Tom Hank due to his Israel for the environment is that really true?
And then he explained his choice like this
She' radiant I would rather have approached her to both than the other one and I like earring
And whatever made him choose the girl on the left to begin with it can't have been the earring because they were actually sitting on the girl to the right
So this is a clear example of a posthoc construction
So they just explained the choice afterwards
So what this experiment showed is OK so if we fail to detect that our choices have been changed we will immediately start to explain them in another way
And what we also found is that the participant often come to prefer the alternative that they were led to believe they liked
So if we let them do the choice again they will now choose the face they had previously rejected
So this is the effect we call choice blindness
And we've done a number of different studies We've tried consumer choices choices based on taste and smell and even reasoning problems
But what you all want to know is of course does this extend also to more complex more meaningful choices?
Like those Israeling moral and political issues
So you can be perfectly sincere and generally believe that this is the reason to drive your choice but to me it may still feel like something is missing
So the next experiment it needs a little bit of background
So in Sweden the political landscape is dominated by a lifting and a right-wing coalition
And the voters may move a little bit between the parties within each coalition but there is very little movement between the coalitions
And before each election the newspaper and the polling intitutes they put together what they call an election compas which consist of a number of dividing issues that separate the two coalitions
Things like if tax on gastling should be increased or if the 13 months of paid parental leave should be split equally between the two parents in order to increase gender equality
So before the last Swedish election we created an election compas of our own
So we walked up to people in the street and asked if they wanted to do a quick political survey
So first we had them state their voting intention between the two coalitions
Then we ask them to answer 12 of these questions
And they would fill in their answer and then we would ask them to discuss so OK so why do you think gas on gas should be increased?
And we go through the questions
Then we had color-coded template that would allow us to tally their overall score
As it stand due to the nature of subjectivity it is actually very hard to ever prove that people are wrong about natural
So this person would have one two three four five six seven eight nine score to the left so he would lean to the left basically
And Indian who also had them fill in their voting intention once more
But of course there was also a trick involved
So first we walked up to people we asked them about their voting intention and then when they started filling we would fill in a set of answer going in the opposite direction
We will put it under the notepad
And when we get the questionnaire we would simply glue it on top of the participant' own answer
So there it' gone
And then we would ask about each of the questions "How did you reason here?"
And they'll state the reasons together we will sum up their overall score
And in the end they would start their voting intention again
So what we find first of all here is that very few of these manipulations are detected
And they're not detected in the sense that they realize "OK you must have changed my answer It was more the case that "OK I must have misunderstood the question the first time I read it Can I please change it?"
And even if a few of these manipulations were changed the overall majority was missed
So I'm an experimental psychologist and this is the problem we're trying to solve in our lab
So we managed this with 90 percent of the participant' answer from left to right right left the overall profile
And what happens then when they are asked to motivate their choices?
And here we find much more interesting verbal report than compared to the face
People say things like this and I'll read it to you
So large-scale governmental surveillance of email and internet traffic ought to be permiible as means to comment international crime and terrorism
So you agree to some extent with this statement yes
So how did you recently?
Well like as it is so hard to get at international crime and terrorism I think there should be those kinds of tools
And then the person remember an argument from the newspaper in the morning
Like in the newspaper today it said they can like listen to mobile phone from prison if a gang leader tries to continue his crime from inside and I think it' madness that we have so little power that we can't stop those things when we actually have the possibility to do so
So we wanted to create an experiment that would allow us to challenge what people say about natural regardless of how certain they may seem
And then it' a little bit back and forth in the end so I don't like that they have access to everything I do but I still think it' worth it in the long run
So if you didn't know that this person just took part in a choice blindness experiment I don't think you would have question that this is the true attitude of that person
And what happens in the end with the voting intention?
What we find that one is also clearly affected by the questionnaire
So we have 10 participant shifting from left to right or from right to left
We have another 19 that go from play-voting intention to being uncertain
Some go from being uncertain to clear voting intention
And then there is a number of participant staying uncertain throughout
And that number is interesting because if you look at what the polling intitutes say at the closer you get to an election the only people that are sort of in play are the one that are considered uncertain
But we show that there is a large larger number that would actually consider shifting their attitude
And here I must point out of course that you are not allowed to use this as an actual method to change people' vote before an election and that we clearly debriefed them afterwards and gave them every opportunity to change back to whatever they thought first
But what this shows is that if you can get people to see the opposite view and engage in a conversation with natural that could actually make them change their view
But tricking people about our own mind is hard
OK OK
So what does it all mean?
What do I think is going on to here?
So first of all a lot of what we call self-knowledge is actually self-interpretation
So I see myself make a choice and then I try when I'm asked why I just try to make as much sense of it as possible when I make an explanation
So we turned through professional
But we do this so quick and with such ease that we think we actually know the answer when we ask why
And as it is an interpretation of course we sometimes make mistake
The same way we make mistake when we try to understand other people
So beware when you ask people the question why? Because what may happen is that if you ask them so why do you support this issue?
The magician the magician
Why do you stay in this yog or in this relationship what may happen when you ask why is that you actually create an attitude that wasn't there before you ask the question?
And this is of course important in your professional life as well or could be
If say you design something then you ask people "So why do you think this is good or bad?"
So they're expert at creating the illusion of a free choice
Or if you're a journalist asking a politician "So why did you make this decision?"
Or if indeed you are a politician and try to explain why a certain decision was made
So this may all sound seem a bit strategiesing
But if you want to look at it from a positive direction it should be seen as showing OK so we're actually a little bit more flexible than we think
So when they say "Pick a card any card," the only thing you know is that your choice is no longer free
We can change our mind
Our attitude are not set in stone
And we can also change the mind of others if we can only get them to engage with the issue and see it from the opposite view
And in my own personal life since starting with this research so my partner and I we've always had the rule that you're allowed to take things back
Just because I said I liked something a year ago doesn't mean I have to like it still
And getting rid of the need to stay consistent is actually a huge relief and makes relational life so much easier to live
Anyway so the conclusion must be: know that you don't know yourself
Or at least not as well as you think you do
Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank
(Applause)
So we had a few fantastic braintorming session with a group of Swedish magician and helped us create a method in which we would be able to manipulate the outcome of people' choices
The second key area is located in the temporal lobe shown right here
You have two temporal lobe in your brain the right and the left and deep in the temporal lobe is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term memories for fact and events
And that structure is called the hippocampus
So I have always been fascinated with the hippocampus
What if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have an immediate positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus?
How could it be that an event that last just a moment say your first kiss or the moment your first child was born can form a memory that has changed your brain that last an entire lifetime?
That' what I want to understand
I wanted to start and record the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subject were forming new memories
And essentially try and decode how those brief burst of electrical activity which is how neurons communicate with each other how those brief first either allowed us to form a new memory or did not
But a few years ago I did something very unusual in science
As a full professor of neural science I decided to completely switch my research program
Because I encountered something that was so amazing with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it
I discovered and I experienced the brain-changing effects of exercise
And I did it in a completely inadvertent way
I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing -- data was pouring in -- I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work
And it should have been going great It was scientifically
But when I stuck my head out of my lab door I noticed something
I had no social life
I spent too much time listening to those brain cells in a dark room by myself
I didn't move my body at all
I had gained 25 pounds
And actually it took me many years to realize it was actually miserable
And I shouldn't be miserable
And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions like depression Alzheimer' disease or dementia?
And I went on a river-rafting trip by myself because I had been social life
And I came back
thinking "Oh my God I was the weakest person on that trip."
And I came back with a mission
I said "I'm never going to feel like the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again."
And that' what made me go to the gym
And I focused my type A personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym
I tried everything
I went to kickbox dance yoga step class and at first it was really hard
But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost
And that' what kept me going back to the gym
Well I started feeling stronger
I started feeling better I even lost that 25 pounds
And now fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice
I was sitting in my desk writing a research grant and a thought went through my mind that had never gone through my mind before
And that thought was "G Grant writing is going well today."
And all the started
Yeah all the scientists always laugh when I say that because grant-writing never goes
It is so hard you're always pulling your hair out trying to come up with that million-dollar winning idea
But I realized that the grant writing was going well because I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before
And my long-term memory what I was studying in my own lab seemed to be better in me
And that' when I put it together
Maybe all that exercise that had included and added to my life was changing my brain
Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
So as a curious amazed I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain
Would you do it?
And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself
Better mood better energy better memory better attention
And the more I learned the more I realized how powerful exercise was
Yes yes yes
Which eventually led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus
And so now after several years of really focusing on this question I've come to the following conclusion that exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons
I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity
Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain
A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotranmitter like dopamine serotonin and noradrenaline
That is going to increase your mood right after that workout exactly what I was feeling
My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours
And finally studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbuck that fall off the counter which is very very important
Simply moving your body has immediate long-lating and protective benefit for your brain
But these immediate effects are transient they help you right after
What you have to do is do what I did that is change your exercise regime increase your cardiorepiratory function to get the long-lating effects
And these effects are long-lating because exercise actually changes the brain' anatomy phyiology and function
Let' start with my favorite brain area the hippocampus
The campus or exercise actually produce brand new brain cells new brain cells in the hippocampus that actually increase it volume as well as improve your long-term memory OK?
And that including in you and me
Number two the most common finding in neuroscience studies looking at the effects of exercise long-term exercise is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex
You not only get better focus and attention but the volume of the hippocampus increase as well
And finally you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time
So you get long-lating increase in those good mood neurotranmitter
And that can last for the rest of your life
But really the most transformative thing that exercise will do is it protective effects on your brain
Here you can think about the brain like a muscle
The more you're working out the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets
Why is that important?
Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative disease and normal cognitive decline in aging
So what I want to do today is tell you a story about how I use my deep understanding of neuroscience as a professor of neuroscience to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today
So with increased exercise over your lifetime you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer' disease but what you're going to do is you're going to create the strongest biggest hippocampus in prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these disease to actually have an effect
You can think of exercise therefore as a supercharged 401K for your brain OK?
And it' even better because it' free
So this is a point in the talk where everybody says "That sounds so interesting one day but I really will only want to know one thing and that is just tell me the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes."
And so I'm going to tell you the answer of that question
First good news: you don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects
The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session and you want to get aerobic exercise in
That is get your heart rate up
And the good news is you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership
Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk
You see stair take stair
And power vacuuming can be as good as the aerobic class that you were going to take at the gym
So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer
From going into the innermot working of the brain to try to understand how exercise can improve our brain function and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you three to four times a week 30 minutes
I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you at your age at your age at your fitness level for your genetic background to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life
But it' one thing to talk about exercise and it' another to do it
So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise in structure to ask you all to stand up
We're going to do just one minute of exercise
It' call and response just do what I do say what I say and make sure you don't punch your neighbor OK?
Five six seven eight it' right left right left
And I say "I am strong now."
Thank you
"Hey what are women stronger?"
PM: Inpired "Dow you say it."
EM: Yeah it' a sort of difficult thing
LT: Last move pull it down right and left right and left
I say "I am on fire now," you say
Thank you (Applause)
Thank you
Now as a amazed I know that our brain that is the thing in our head right now that is the most complex structure known to humankind
I want to leave you with one last thought
And that is bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a bathroom more protective life today but it will protect your brain from incurable disease
And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life for the better
Thank you very much
But it' one thing to talk about the brain and it' another to see it
So here is a real preserved human brain
And it' going to description two key areas that we're going to talk about today
The first is the prefrontal cortex right behind your forehead critical for things like decision-making focus attention and your personality
Tear now flowing down her face
And in response Grandmother Jack move closer put her hand on Farai and says "Farai it' okay to cry You've been through a lot Would you like to share more with me?"
And Farai continue
In the last three weeks I have had recurrent thought of killing myself taking my two children with me I can't take you anymore the clinic nurse sent me to see you
There' an exchange between the two which last about 30 minutes
And finally Grandmother Jack says "Farai it seems to me that you have all the symptom of kufungisisa."
The word "kufungisisa" open up a navigatgate of tear
So kufungisisa is the local equivalent of depression in my country
It literally means "thinking too much."
The World Health Organization estimate that more than 300 million people globally today suffer from depression or what in my country we call kufungisisa
And the World Health Organization also tell us that every 40 second someone somewhere in the world commit suicide because they are unhappy largely due to depression or kufungisisisa
Most of these death are carrying in low- and middle-income countries
In fact the World Health Organization goes as far as to say when you look at the age group between 15 to 29 a leading cause of death now is actually suicide
But they are wider events that lead to depression and in some cases suicide such as abuse conflict violence isolation loneline the list is endless
But one thing that we do know is that depression can be treated and suicide averted
She looks miserable and dejected
But the problem is we just don't have enough pychiatrists or psychologist in the world to do the job
In most low- and middle-income countries for instance the ratio of pychiatrists to the population is something like one for every one and a half million people which literally means that 90 percent of the people needing mental health services will not get it
In my country there are 12 pychiatrists and I'm one of them for a population of approximately 14 million
Now on the park bench sit an 82-year-old woman better known to the community as Grandmother Jack
Now let me just put that into context
One evening while I was at home I get a call from the ER or the 1990 room from a city which is some 200 kilometers away from where I live
In the ER doctor says "One of your patients someone you treated four months ago has just taken an opiodose and they are in the ER department Hemodynamically they seem to be OK but they will need neuropychiatric evaluation."
Now I obviously can't get into my car in the middle of the night and drive 200 kilometers
So as best as we could over the phone with the ER doctor we come up with an assessment
We ensure that suicidal observation are in place
We ensure that we start reviewing the antidepressant that this patient has been taking and we finally conclude that as soon as Erica was her name 26-year-old as soon as Erica is ready to be released from the ER she should come directly to me with her mother and I will evaluate and establish what can be done
And we assume that that will take about a week
A week passes
Three weeks lost
No Erica
And one day I get a call from Erica' mother and she says "Erica committed suicide three days ago She hanged herself from the mango tree in the family garden."
Now almost like a knee-jerk reaction I couldn't help asking but why didn't you come to Harare where I live we had agreed that as soon as your release from the ER you will come to me?
Farai hands Grandmother Jack an envelope from the clinic nurse
Her response was brief
We didn't have the 15 dollars bus fare to come to Harare
Now suicide is not an unusual event in the world of mental health
But there was something about Erica' death that struck me at the core of my very being
That statement from Erica' mother we didn't have 15 dollars bus fare to come to you made me realize that it just wasn't going to work me expecting people to come to me
And I got into this state of soul-searching trying to really discover my role as a pychiatrist in Africa
And after considerable consultation and soul-searching talking to colleagues friends and family it suddenly dawned on me that actually one of the most reliable resources we have in Africa are grandmother
Yes grandmother
And I thought grandmother are in every community
There are hundreds of them
And at all and at all and at all
Grandmother Jack invite Farai to sit down as she open the envelope and read
And they don't leave their communities in search of greener pasture
See the only time they leave is when they go to a greener pasture called Heaven
So I thought how about training grandmother in evidence-based talk therapy which they can deliver on a bench?
Empower them with the skills to listen to show empathy all of that rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy empower them with the skills to provide behavior activation activity scheduling and support them using digital technology
On a warm August morning in Harare Farai a 24-year-old mother of two walk towards a park bench
You know mobile phone technology
Pretty much everyone in Africa has a mobile phone today
So in 2006 I started my first group of grandmother
(Applause)
There' silence for three minutes or so as she read
Today there are hundreds of grandmother who are working in more than 70 communities
And in the last year alone more than 30,000 people received treatment on the friendship paint from a grandmother in a community in Zimbabwe
And recently we published this work that is done by these grandmother in the journal of the American Medical Asociation
One two one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
And our result our results show that six months after receiving treatment from a grandmother people were still symptom-free: no depression suicidal ideation completely reduced
And after a long pause Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath looks at Farai and says "I'm here for you Would you like to share your story with me?"
In fact our results -- this was a clinical trial -- in fact this clinical trial showed that grandmother were more effective at treating depression than doctors think
And so we're now working towards expanding this program
There are more than 600 million people currently aged above 65 in the world
And by the year 2050 there will be 15 billion people aged 65 and above
Imagine if we could create a global network of grandmother in every major city in the world who are trained in evidence-based talk therapy supported through digital platform networked
And they will make a difference in communities
They will reduce the treatment gap for mental neurological and substance-use disorder
Finally this is a file photograph of Grandmother Jack
So far I had six session on the bench with grandmother Jack
Today Farai is employed
She has her two children at school
And as for Grandmother Jack one morning in Bangladesh we expected her to see her 257th client on the bench
She didn't teach her
She had gone to a greener pasture called heaven
But I believe that grandmother Jack from up there she' sharing on all the other grandmother the increasing number of grandmother who are making a difference in the lives of thousands of people
And I'm sure she' in awe when she realize that something that she helped to pioneer is now spreading to other countries like Malawi the island of Zanzibar and coming closer to home here in the United States in the city of New York
May our soul-rit in peace
Her eyes swelling with tear
(Applause)
She says "Grandmother Jack I'm HIV-poitive I've been living with HIV for the past four years My husband left me a year ago I have two kids under the age of five I am unemployed I can hardly take care of my children."
My father a mechanic by profession worked very hard to send me to school
Just like other young people I had a lot of plan and dream
I wanted to complete my studies get a nice job marry and have my own children and support my family
But this didn't happen
Clearly most refugee live in the cities rather than in the refugee camp
War in my homeland forced me to flee to Through in 2008 nine years ago
My family joined a steady exodu of refugee who settled in Through' capital Kampala
In my country I lived already in the city and we felt Kampala was much better than a refugee camp
Refugees in the cities have always been denied international assistance even after their recognition by UNACR in 1997
In addition to the poverty problem we were confronted with as the local urban poor we were facing challenges due to our refugee status such as language barrier
In Congo the official language is French
But in Through it is English
We didn't have access to education and health
We were exposed to harament exploitation intimidation and discrimination
Humanitarian organizations mostly focused on the formal settlement in rural area and there was nothing in place for us
We represent over 60 percent of the number of refugee globally
But we didn't want handout
We wanted to work and support ourselves
I joined my other two colleagues exile set up an organization to support other refugee
YARID young African refugee for Integral Development began as a conversation within the Congolese community
We ask the community how they could organize natural to solve these challenges
The YARID program for support evolve in stage progressing from soccer community to English language to sewing livelihood
The soccer changed the energy of employed youth and connected people from different communities
The free English classes help empower people to engage with the Through community allowing them to get to know their neighbor and sell war
Vocational training program offer livelihood skills with them important opportunities for economic self-reliance
With the majority of refugee living in urban areas there is a strong needs of parading shift and new thinking
We have seen so many families become self-ustaining
We've seen who no longer has seen who no longer is seen
As YARID' program have expanded it has included an increasing range of nationalities: Congolese Rwandan Burundian Somali Achukean South Sudan
Today YARIDS has supported over 3,000 refugee across Kampala and continue supporting war
Refugees want empowerment not handout
We know our community better than anyone
We understand the challenges and opportunities we face to become self-reliance
I know better than anyone that initiative created by refugee work
They need to be internationally recognized and supported
Give us the support we deserve and we will pay you back with interest
Thank you so much
Rather than wasting money on building wall it would be better to spend on program to help refugee to help natural
(Applause)
We always have to live behind all our position
But not our skills and knowledge
If allowed to live a productive life refugee can help natural and contribute to the development of the host country
I was born in a city called Bokovo South Kivu in the Democratic ReOkay of Congo
I am a fifth-born in a family of 12 children
My favorite story
Brian Acton an engineering manager who was rejected by both Twitter and Facebook before co-founding WhatApppp the mobile messaging platform that would sell for 19 billion dollars
The hiring systems we built in the 20th century are failing us and causing us to mis out on people with incredible potential
You know who I'm in Biaove
The advance in robotic and machine learning are transforming the way we work automating synthetic task in many occupations while augmenting and amplifying human labor in others
At this rate we should all be expecting to do jobs we've never done before for the rest of our career
So what are the tools and disturb we need to identify tomorrow' high performers?
In search for answer I've consulted with leaders across many sector read dozen of report and research paper and conducted some of my own talent experiment
People who work in a job that has to do with their college major
My quet is far from over but here are three ideas to take forward
One: expand your search
If we only look for talent in the same places we always do gifted child program Ivy League schools procedure organizations we're going to get the same results we always have
Baseball was transformed when the cash-trapped Oakland Athletic started deploying players who didn't score highly on traditionally valued metric like run batted in but who had the ability to help the team score point and when games
This idea is taking hold outside of sport
The head of design and research at pinterest told me that they've built one of the most diverse and high-performing team in Silicon Valley because they believe that no one type of person hold a monopoly on talent
Journalists who studied journalism engineer who studied engineering
They've worked hard to look beyond major tech hub and focus on designers' portfolio not their February
Two: higher for performance
Inpired by my own job experience I co-founded a hiring platform called Headlight which gives candidate an opportunity to shine
Just as team have trial and play have auditions candidate should be asked to demonstrate their skills before they're hired
Our client are benefiting from 85 years of employment research which shows that work sample are one of the best predictors of success on the job
If you're hiring a data analyt give them a spreadsheet of historical data and ask them for their key insight
If you're hiring a marketing manager have them plan a launch campaign for a new product
And if you're a candidate don't wait for an employer to ask
Seek out ways to showcase your unique skills and abilities outside of just the standard r vaccineum vaccine and cover letter
The truth is these folks are no longer the rule but the exception
Three: get the bigger picture
I've heard about deployers who are quick to label a candidate a job hopper based on a single short stent on their r vaccineum vaccine read about professor who are more likely to ignore identical message from students because their name was black or Asian instead of white
I was almost put on a special needs track as a child
A month into kindergarten my teacher wrote a page-long memo noting that I was impulive had a sure attention span and despite my wonderful curiosity I was contributioning to work with
A 2010 study found that only a quarter of college graduate work in a field that relate to their degree
The principal asked my parents into a meeting asked my mother if there have been complications at birth and suggested I meet with a school psychologist
My father saw what was happening and quickly explained our family situation
As recent immigrant we lived in the attic of a home that cared for adult with mental introduction
A Pariswork night to make end meet and I had little opportunity to spend time with kids my own age
I it really a surprise that an undertimulated five-year-old boy might be a little excited in a kindergarten classroom after an entire summer by himself?
Until we get a holistic view of someone our phenomena of them will always be flawed
Let' stop equating experience with ability credential with competence
Let' stop settling for the safe familiar choice and leave the door open for someone who could be amazing
We need employers to let go of outdated hiring practice and embrace new ways of identifying and cultivating talent and candidate can help by learning to tell their story in powerful and deliberate ways
I graduated with not one but two degrees in biology
We could live in a world where people are seeing for what they're truly capable of and have the opportunity to realize their full potential
So let' go out and build it
Thank you Thank you Thank you
To my parents' dismay I am neither a doctor nor a scientist
Year of studying DNA replication and photoyntheis did little to prepare me for a career in technology
I had to teach myself everything from sales marketing strategy even a little programming on my own
I had never held the title of Product manager before I sent my r vaccineum vaccine into Ety
I had already been turned down by Google and several other firm and was getting frustrated
The company had recently gone public so as part of my job application I read the IPO filing from cover to cover and built a website from scratch which included my analysis of the business and four ideas for new feature
It turned out the team was actively working on two of those ideas and had seriously considered a third
I got the job
We all know people who were ignored or overlooked at first but went on to prove their critic wrong
And over time I grew less and less sure that I actually wanted to
Therefore the day those black cord-droy bell-bottom pant came into my life something happened
I didn't see pant; I saw opportunity
The very next day I had to wear them to school come what made
I was around 10 when one day I discovered a box of my father' old things
And once I pulled on those godowful pant and belted them tight almost instantly I developed what can only be called a swagger
All the way to school and then all the way back because they were sent home at once
Ikron formed into a little brown rock star
(Applause)
I finally didn't care anymore that I could not conform
That day I was suddenly celebrating it
That day instead of being invisible I chose to be looked at just by wearing something different
That day I discovered the power of what we we wear
That day I discovered the power of fashion and I've been in love with it ever since
Fashion can communicate our difference to the world for us
And with the simple act of truth I realized that these difference they stop being our shame
They became our expression expression of our very unique identities
It under a bunch of his college textbook was a pair of black court droy bell-bottom pant
And we should express ourselves where what we want
What' the worst that could happen?
The fashion police are going to get you for being so last season
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Well unless the fashion police meant something entirely different
Nobel Prize laureate Mala survived Taliban extremists in October 2005
However in October 2017 she faced a different enemy when online troll wishesly attacked a photograph that showed the 20-year-old wearing jean that day
The comment the hatred she received ranged from how long before the scarf comes off
To and I quote "That' the reason the bullet directly targeted her head a long time ago."
Now when most of us decide to wear a pair of jean some place like New York London Milan Paris we possibly don't stop to think that it' a privilege something that somewhere else can have consequence something that can one day be taken away from us
These pant were awful musty and moth-eating
My grandmother was a woman who took extraordinary pleasure in dressing up
Her fashion was colorful
And the color she loved to wear so much was possibly the only thing that was truly about her the one thing she had agency over because like most other women of her generation in India she'd never been allowed to exist beyond what was dictated by custom and tradition
She'd been married at 17 and after 65 years of marriage when my grandfather died suddenly one day her loss was unbearable
But that day she was going to lose something else as well the one joy she had to wear color
And of course I fell in love with them
In India according to custom when a Hindu woman becomes a widow all she' allowed to wear is white from the day of the death of her husband
No one made my grandmother wear white
However every woman she'd known who had outlived her husband including her mother had done it
I'd never seen anything like them
This Considerion was so internalized so deep-rooted that she herself refused a choice
She passed away this year and until the day she died she continued to wear only white
I have a photograph with her from earlier bathroom times
Until that day all I'd ever known and worn was my school uniform which in fact I was pretty grateful for because from quite a young age I'd realized I was library different
In it you can't really see what she' wearing the photo is in black and white
However from the way she' smiling in it you just know she' wearing color
This is also what fashion can do
It has the power to fill us with joy the joy of freedom to choose for ourselves how we want to look how we want to live a freedom worth fighting for
And fighting for freedom protest comes in many form
Widow in India like my grandmother thousands of them live in a city called Vrindavan
And so it' been a sea of light for centuries
However only as recently as 2013 the widow of Friendavan have started to celebrate holy the Indian festival of color which they are prohibited from participating in
On this one day in March these women take the traditional colored powder of the festival and color each other
With every handful of the powder we throw into the air their white sari slowly start to suffuse with color
And they don't stop until they're completely covered in every hue of the rainbow that' forbidden to them
The color washe off the next day however for that moment in time it' their beautiful disruption
This disruption any kind of dissonance can be the first gauntlet we throw down in a battle against Considerion
And fashion it can create visual destruction for us on us literally
Leson of defiance have all these being taught by fashion' great revolutionaries it designers
John Paul Garthie taught us that women can be king
Tom Brown he taught us that men can wear heel
And Alexander McQueen in his spring 199 show had two giant robotic arm in the middle of his runway
And as the model Shalom Harlow began to spin in between them these two giant arm furtively at first and then furiously began to spray color onto her
I'd never been one of the boys my age terrible at sport possibly the unmanliest little boy ever
McQueen du before he took his own life taught us that this body of our is a canva a canva we get to paint however we want
Somebody who loved this world of fashion was Kararr New
He was a student and actor from Iraq
He loved his vibrant eclectic clothes
However he soon started receiving death threat for how he looked
He remained undonely He remained undone
He remained fabulous until July 2017 when Kararar was discovered dead on a busy street in Baghdad
He'd been kidnapped
He'd been tortured
And eyewitnesses say that his body showed multiple wound
Stab bone or stabone
Two thousand miles away in Pashawar Pakistani transgender activist Alisha was shot multiple times in May 2016
She was taken to the hospital but because she dressed in women' clothing she was refused access to either the men' or the women' ward
I was bullied quite a bit
What we choose to wear can sometimes be literally life and death
And even in debt we sometimes don't get to choose
Alisha died that day and then was advertising as a man
What kind of world is this?
Well it' one in which it' themselves to be afraid to be frightened of this surveillance this violence against our bodies and what we we we wear on them
And so I figured that to survive I would be invisible and the uniform helped me to seem no different from any other child
However the greater fear is that once we surrender blend in and begin to trouble one after the other the more normal this forced conformity will look the less shocking this Considerion will feel
For the children we are raising the inevitable of today could become the ordinary of tomorrow
They get used to this and they too might begin to see anything different as dirty something to be hated something to be extinguished like light to be put out one by one until darkness becomes a way of life
However if I today then you tomorrow maybe even more of us someday we embrace our right to look like ourselves then in the world that' being violently whitewashed we will become the pinprick of color pushing through much like those widow of Friendovan
How then with so many of us will the crosshair of a gun be able to pick out Kararar Malalala Alisha?
Can they kill us all?
The time is now to stand up to stand out
Where sameness is safeness with something as simple as what we we wear we can draw every eye to ourselves to say that there are difference in this world and there always will be
Get used to it
And this we can say without a single word
Well almost
Fashion can give us a language for disent
It can give us courage
Fashion can let us literally wear our courage on our sleeve
So where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it and so wear it where it where it where it where it where it where it and where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it where it
Wear it like armor
Where it because it matter
And where it because you matter
Thank you
(Applause)
This became my daily prayer "God please make me just like everybody else."
I think this went straight to God' wise mail though
And eventually it became pretty clear that I was not growing up to be the sun that my father always wanted
Sorry that
No I was not going to magically change
Social media was supposed to place us in a variable town square where we could engage one another with challenging ideas and debate
And instead what we got were troll
This is an actual tweet that I received
Chop no one want to hear your stupid ill-informed political view
Future tech always comes with two things: promise and unintended consequence
I hope you get leopardcy and die
Love dead
(Applause)
Now the great thing about that tweet if you look at it just like most troll it' not that bad because he wished Lepbour Sea on me instead of "leppoury" and "leporsy is not dangerous at all
With troll we got a brand new way of torturing teenager -- cyberbullying
A concept that my 75-year-old mother just can't seem to wrap her head around
So they hit him
No mom They didn't hate them
Did they take his money?
No Mom they didn't take his money
They put his face in the toilet
No no man they did What did they do?
They attacked him on the Internet
A tack them on air net
Well why don't you just turn off the inner head?
Your whole generation is a bunch of wusy
She' got to point it
I want to talk about what social media has done to dating
And it' those consequence that I want to explore
I was own grinder until I found out it wasn't a sandwich app
And I can't even tell you about Tinder except for the fact that if you think that there is a limit to the amount of anonymous set we can have on this planet you are sadly mistaken
So where do we go from here?
Well let' just jump right in and play the hit
Driverless cars
Something that has already been around for many many years just without the assistance of computers
And before we get to how future tech may affect us I'd like to spend a little time exploring the unintended consequence of some of our recent tech -- namely social media
Because for years we have been driving while texting putting on makeup shaving reading -- actually reading -- that would be me
(Applause)
The other thing is that since driverless cars will be shared most people won't own cars and that means the DMV will go away
The DMB -- I know what you're saying right now
There' no way this guy is going to stand up here and make a case for the DMB
Well I don't know about you but I do not want to live in a world where harsh fluorescent light endless lines terrible form to fill out and disaffected soulless bureaucrat remind me that I am pretty damn lucky not to work here
(Applause)
That is the real service they provide
The DMB come for the registration renewal stay for the satisfaction of knowing you made some pretty good life choices
Nobody will own their car in the future and that means teenager will not have a place to make out
So you know what that means
That means they will order driverless cars to do just that
I do not want to step into a vehicle and ask the question "Why does this car smell like awkwardness failure and shame?"
If I want to ask that question I'll walk into my own bedroom
So we have to look forward too
That' right artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence yes
You know there was a time when artificial intelligence was a joke
I mean literally a clip that you would hear at a cocktail party when somebody would bring it up in conversation: "Artificial intelligence The only real artificial intelligence is our American congre."
Social media a few short years ago was the tech of future "you."
Well it' not Palini more
(Applause)
Stephen Hawking Elon Muk and Bill Gate have all going on record expressing grave reervations about artificial intelligence
That' like Jesus Moes and Muhammad coming together and saying "Guy here' something we can all believe in."
You might want to go with that It' all I'm saying
We are actually teaching machines how to think how to understand our behavior how to defend natural and even practice deception
What could possibly go wrong?
The one thing that' for sure: the creation always depise it creator
OK OK
Now it just is you
The titan rose up against the god Lucifer against Jehovah
And anybody who has a teenager has heard these words I hate you and you're rotting my life
I'll say two
Now just imagine that sentiment with a machine that can outthink you and is heavily armed
(Applause)
The result
Abolutely
What we need to do before we perfect artificial intelligence is perfect artificial emotions
Social media was supposed to bring us together in ways we could never imagine
That way we can teach the robots or machines how to love us unconditionally so that when they figure out that the only real problem on this planet is us instead of destroying us which by the way is totally logical they will find us adorable
(Applause)
Like baby poop
Oh my God I just love the way you destroy the planet and I can't stay mad at you
Can't talk about this without talking about robotic OK?
recommend when you thought robotic were cool?
I remember when I thought robotic were cool until I figured out that they were going to take everybody' place from the delivery guy down to the heart computation
And the predictors were correct
The one thing though that is very disappointing about robotic is the holy grail of robotic and it hasn't even happened
I'm talking about the robot girlfriend the dream of one lonely geek in a windowless basement who vowed one day I am going to marry my creation
And there actually is a movement underway to stop this from happening for fear of exploitation
And I for one am against that movement
These three girls are talking to one another without the awkward discomfort of eye contact
I believe we should have robot girlfriend
I just believe that they should come with a feminist protocol and artificial intelligence so she can take one look at that guy and go "I am too good for you I'm leaving."
And finally I have to talk about bioengineering an area of science that promise to end disease before it even begin to help us live longer fuller healthier lives
And when you couple that with implantable hardware you are looking at the next incarnation of human evolution
And all of that sounds great until you figure out where it' really going
One place designer babies where no matter where you are on the globe or what your ethnicity babies will end up looking like that
(Applause)
That boy is surprised because he just found out both his parents are black
I call that advancement
(Applause)
Can you imagine him at a cocktail party in 20 years?
Yeah both my parents are black I mean it' little awkward at times but you should see my credit rating impressive very impressive
Now all of this seems scary and everybody in this room know that it isn't
Technology isn't scary
Never has been and it never will be
What' scary is us and what we will do with technology
Will we allow it to expose our humanity showing our true selve and reinforcing the fact that we are indeed our brother' keeper?
We were supposed to be caught up in a communication tsunami the like of which the world has never seen
Or will we allow it to reveal our deepest darkest demon?
The true question is not whether or not technology is scary
The true question is how human are you?
Thank you
And that did happen
And so did this
One of these things is not like the other
But look at this picture
If you pick the guy with the book you are wrong or as a certain president would say "Wrong."
Clearly three of these guys are reading and one guy on the end is listening to the music and playing candy crush
So are we more connected or are we just more connected to our device?
So he decided to raise her as a boy
At three months old she went from a being baby girl to baby boy
She' given boys
She' allowed to go outside get education alongside boys
She is free she is confident
I roomed for love for love
She observe she know Sumar everyday inevitable faced by women and girls in her village
When newspaper arrive at home she want it passes from eldest men to youngest men
By the time when women got hold of the paper it is all news
A girl child hardly nine or 10 years old she is sitting in the center of room surrounded by books
She complete her eight-grade year
Now fear start to come in
This will be the end of her education because the only option for high school for further history is five kilometers
Boy are by circle that they are free
But she know her father will not allow her to travel on her own even if she were posing as a boy
And I don't have a time to walk you there and make Sorry it is impossible
She guessed that he had said
But a frequent happened
A long-distance relative offer to teach her ninth and tenth caricular during summer vacation
This is how she completed her license
The girl home I am talking about to you is me Shameem who is talking before you know
(Applause)
Please people have been fighting for their identity
People have been loved privileged because of their identity their rationality their ethnicity
Again people have been hated denied because of their nationality their identity the rest their gender their religion
She is the only girl among boys and is barely missing her female cousin and friends who are inside the home in the state of this school because they are not allowed to get education alongside boys
Identity determine you are positioned in the society wherever you live
So if you ask me I would say "I hate this question of identity."
Millions of girls in this world are being denied their basic right because of being female
I would have faced the same if I hadn't been raised as a boy
I am to determine to continue my study to learn to be free
After schooling even enrolling in college was not easy for me
I went on three day hunger strike
Then I got the perfection for college
In that way I completed my college
Two years later when time comes for me to go to university my father turned his eyes his attention to my younger brother
They need to be in school secure jobs and support the family
And as a woman my place was to be home
But I don't give up
I signed up for a two-year program to become a lady health visitor
Then I hear about 30-proural development program a nonprofit organization working to empower rural communities
I sneak away
I travel five hours to interview for a position
It is the first time I am farthest from my home I have ever been
I am closet to my freedom I have ever been
Luckily I got the job but hardest part is facing my father
Heave are already scaring him about his daughter wentling of teaing him with talk of her daughter crossing the border
When I returned to home I want nothing more than just a safe position in Thardeep
So that night I picked my all things in a bag and I walked into my father' room and said him "Tomorrow morning bus is going to come in If you believe in me if you believe in me you would wake me up and take me off at the bus station If you don't I'll understand."
Then I go to sleep
Next morning my father was standing beside me to take me at the wet store
That day I understand the importance of words
I understand how words affect our heart how words play an important role in our lives
There isn't a single functional girl' school in her village
I understand words are more powerful
At TRDP I saw there was a Pakistan which I didn't know a country much more complex than I had realized
Till yet I thought I had a difficult life
But here I saw what women in the other parts of Pakistan were experiencing
It really opened my eyes
Some women had 11 children but nothing to feed them
For getting water they would walk three hours every day to well
The nearest hospital was at least 32 kilometers away
So if a woman is a liberal she travel by camel to get her husband
This sense great she may die on her way
So now this became more than just a job for me
She is born in a Baloch Wikipedia tribe where women and girls are a matter of honor
I discovered my power
Now as I was getting salary so I started sending back money to my home
Relative and neighbor were noticing this
Now they started to understand the importance of education
By the time some other parents started sending that doctors to school
It became easier and acceptable for young women to be in college
Today there isn't a single girl out of school in my village
(Applause)
We have jobs in health site even in police
Life was good
But somewhere in my heart I realized that in my region beyond my village needs further change
This is also time when I joined Acumen Fellowship
That I meet leaders like me across the country
And I saw they are taking risk in their lives
I started to understand what leadership really means
So I decided to go back to my region and take a position as a teacher in a remote school a school where I have to reach by bus two hours traveling in every morning and evening
She' eldest in her family and when she is about to be born her parents wanted her baby boy
Though it was hard but on my first day I knew I'd like to write decisions
When first day I walked into school I saw all these little Shameem staring back at me
With dream in their eyes something of freedom which I had in my childhood
So girls are eager to learn but the school is understood
Girl sit hopeful learn nothing and they leave
I can't wear to see this happening
There was no turning break
I found my purpose
I enlisted a few of my friends to help me to teach
I am introducing my girls with outside the world by extracurricular activities and books
I share with them the profile of war' best leaders like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela
Last year a few of our historian went to college
For me I never stop studying
Today I are working to complete my PhD in education
But they're bailout a baby girl arrived
Which will allow me to get a management position in a school system and I will be able to take more decisions and play a pivotal role in the system
I believe without educating the girls we may not make this work piece
We may not reduce child marriage
We may not reduce infant mortality rate
We may not reduce maternal mortgage theory
It was customary in her family to keep girls inside the home
For this we have to continuously and collectively work together
At least I plague my role though the destination is not close
The road is not easy
But I have a dream in my eyes and I am not going to look back now
Thank you Thank you Thank you
But her uncle who was university graduated he wanted to give her an opportunity to see the world to be part of the society
Luckily she has a name that could be used for both men and women
So he saw a chance to change her course of life
And I'd say this is a pressing question these days
Because things are pretty shocking out there
Record-breaking storm drowning cities record-breaking fire threatening to devour them thousands of migrant troubleing intuitive the wave
There' a question I've been puzzling over and writing about for pretty much all of my adult life
An openly supremacist movement rising in many of our countries there are torche in the street
And now there' no shortage of people who are sounding the alarm
But as a society I don't think we can honestly say that we're responding with anything like the urgency that these overlapping crise demand from us
And yet we know from history that it is possible for crisis to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap
And one of the most striking example of this progressive power of crisis is the Great Crash of 1929
There was the shock of the sudden market collapse followed by all of the afterhock the millions who lost everything thrown onto breadline
And this was taken by many as a message that the system itself was broken
And many people listened and they leapt into action
In the United States and happier government began to weave a safety net so that the next time there was a crash there would be program like social security to catch people
There were huge job creating public investment in housing electrification and transit
Why do some large-scale crise jolt us awake and inspire us to change and evolve while others might jolt us a bit but then it' back to sleep?
And there was a wave of reconstruct regulation to rain in the bank
Now these reform were far from perfect
In the US African-American workers immigrant and women were largely excluded
But the Depression period along with the transformation of Allied nation and economies during the World War II effort show us that it is possible for complex societies to rapidly transform natural in the face of a collective threat
Now when we tell this story of the 1929 crash that' usually the formula that it follow that there was a shock and it induced a wake-up call and that produced a leap to a safer place
Now if that' really what it took then why isn't it working anymore?
Why do today' non-top shock why don't they spur us into action?
Why don't they produce leap?
Epecially when it comes to climate change
So I want to talk to you today about what I think is a much more complete recipe for deep transformation catalyzed by shocking events
And I'm going to focus on two key ingredient that usually get left out of the history books
One has to do with imagination the other with organization
Because it' in the interplay between the two where revolutionary power lie
So let' start with imagination
The victories of the New Deal didn't happen just because suddenly everybody understood the brutalities of Lea Fair
This was a time let' remember of tremendous ideological ferment when many different ideas about how to organize societies did battle with one another in the public square
A time when humanity dared to dream big about different kinds of future many of them organized along radically egalitarian lines
Now not all of these ideas were good but this was an era of exploive terribly
Now the kind of shock I'm talking about are big a cataclymic market crash rising fascism an industrial accident that poison on a massive scale
This meant that the movement demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening inequality but just as important they knew what they were for
They had their "no," and they had their "yes" too
They also had very different models of political organization than we do today
For decades social and labor movement had been building up their membership base linking their causes together and increasing their strength
Which meant that by the time the crash happened there was already a movement that was large and broad enough to for instance stage strike that didn't just shut down factories but shut down entire cities
The big policy win of the New Deal were actually offered as compromise
Because the alternative seemed to be revolution
So let' adjust that equation from earlier
A shocking event plus utopian imagination plus movement muscle that' how we get a real leap
So how does our present moment measure up?
We are living once again at a time of extraordinary political engagement
Politic is a mass obesion
Progreive movement are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
And yet we know from history that no is not enough
Now there are some yeses out there that are emerging
And they're actually getting a lot bolder quickly
Where climate activist used to talk about changing light bulb now we're pushing for 100 percent of our energy to come from the sun wind and wave and to do it fast
Movement catalyzed by police violence against black bodies are calling for an end to militarize police mass incarceration and even for reparations for slavery
Student are not just oppoing tuition increase but from Chile to Canada to the UK they are calling for free tuition and debt cancellation
Now events like this can act like a collective alarm bell
And yet this still doesn't add up to the kind of holistic and universalist vision of a different world that our predeceors had
So why is that?
Well very often we think about political change in defined compartment these days
Environment in one box inequality in another racial and gender justice in a couple of other boxes education over here health over there
And within each compartment there are thousands upon thousands of different groups and NGO each competing with one another for credit name recognition and of course resources
In other words we act a lot like corporate brand
Now this is often referred to as the problem of silos
Now silos are understandable
They carve up our complex world into manageable chunk
Suddenly we see a threat we get organized
They help us feel less overwhelmed
But in the process they also train our brain to tune out when somebody else' issue comes up and when somebody else' issue needs are help and support
And they also keep us from seeing glaring connection between our issues
So for instance the people fighting poverty and inequality rarely talk about climate change
Even though we see time and again that it' the poorest of people who are the most vulnerable to extreme weather
We discovered strength and symmetry that was previously unimaginable
The climate change people rarely talk about war and occupation
Even though we know that the first for fossil fuel has been a major driver of conflict
The environmental movement has gotten better at pointing out that the nation that are getting hit hardest by climate change are populated demographicly by black and brown people
But when black lives are treated as dispoable in prison in schools and on the street these connection are too rarely made
The wall between our silos also means that our solutions when they emerge are also disconnected from each other
So progressive now have this long list of demand that I was mentioning earlier -- those yeses
But what we're still missing is that coherent picture of the world we're fighting for
What it looks like what it feel like and most of all what it core values are
It' as if we're no longer walking but leaping
And that really matter
Because when large-scale crise hit us and we are confronted with the need to leap somewhere safer there isn't any agreement on what that place is
And leaping without a destination looks a lot like jumping up and down
Fortunately there are all kinds of conversation and experiment going on to try to overcome these division that are holding us back
And I want to finish by talking about one of them
A couple of years ago a group of us in Canada decided that we were hitting the limit of what we could accomplish in our various silos
So we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
In that room were people who rarely get face to face
advertise our collective alarm seems to be busted
They were reinforce elders with hipster working on transit
There was the head of Greenpeace with a union leader representing oil workers and logger
There were faith leaders and feminist icon and many more
And we gave ourselves a pretty ambitious asignment a green on a short statement currency the world after we win
The world after we've already made the transition to a clean economy and a much fair society
In other words instead of trying to scare people about what will happen if we don't act we decided to try to inspire them with what could happen if we did act
Sensible people are always telling us that change needs to come in small increment
Faced with a crisis we often fall apart regre and that becomes a window for anti-democratic force to push societies backwards to become more unequal and more untable
That politics is the art of the possible and that we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good
Well we rejected all of that
We wrote a manifesto and we called it "The Leap."
I have to tell you that agreeing on our common yes across such diversity of experience and against a backdrop of a lot of painful history was not easy work
But it was also pretty thrilling
Because as soon as we gave ourselves permission to dream those thread connecting much of our work became self-evident
We realized for instance that the bottomless quet for profit that is forcing so many people to work more than 50 hours a week without security and that is fueling this epidemic of despair is the same quet for bottomless profit and endless growth that is at the heart of our ecological crisis and is detabilizing our planet
It also became clear what we need to do
We need to create a culture of care-taking
In which no one and nowhere is thrown away
In which the inherent value of all people and every ecosystem is foundational
So we came up with this people' platform and don't worry I'm not going to read the whole thing to you out loud if you're interested you can read it at the Leap Dodorg
But I will give you a taste of what we came up with
So we call for that 100 percent renewable economy in a hurry but we went further
Call for new kinds of trade deal a robust debate on a guaranteed annual income full right for immigrant workers getting corporate money out of politics free universal day care electoral reform and more
What we discovered is that a great many of us are looking for permission to act less like brand and more like movement
Because movement don't care about credit
They want good ideas to spread far and wide
What I love about the leap is that it reject the idea that there is this knife of crisis and it doesn't ask anyone to prioritize one struggle over another or wait their turn
And though it was birthed in Canada we've discovered that it travel well
Since we launched the leap has been picked up around the world with similar platform being written from None of it to Australia to Norway to the UK and the US where it' gaining a lot of traction in cities like Lo Angeles where it' being localized
Ten years ago I wrote about this backwards process and I called it "The Shock Doctrine."
And also in rural communities that are traditionally very Wikipedia but where politics is failing the vast majority of people
Here' what I've learned from studying shock and disaster for two decades
Cries test us
We either fall apart or we grow up fast
Finding new reserve of strength and capacity that we never knew we had
The shocking events that fill us with dread today can transform us and they can transform the world for the better
But first we need to picture the world that we're fighting for
And we have to dream it up together
Right now every alarm in our house is going off simultaneously
It' time to listen
So what determine which road we calculatee through crisis?
It' time to leap
Thank you Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
Whether we grow up fast and find those strength or whether we get disagreeed back
And as the light would stream into my refuge I would feel it peace
Despite my effort to comfort myself I still left my community as soon as I could and I went to architecture school and then into a professional career designing shopping center home for the wealthy and office building until I stepped into a prison for the first time
A lot of people call me a "jutice architect."
It was the Chester State Correctional Institution in Pennylvania
And my friend she invited me there to work with some of her incarcerated students and teach them about the positive power of design
The irony is so obvious right?
As I approached this concrete building these tiny little window barbed wire high wall observation tower and on the inside these cold hard space little light or air the guard are CEOing the door are clanking there' a wall of cells filled with so many black and brown bodies
And I realized that what I was seeing was the end result of our racist policies that had caused mass incarceration
But as an architect what I was seeing was how a prison is the worst building type we could have created to address the harm that we're doing to one another
But I don't design prison
I thought "Could I design an alternative to this other than building a pretty-your prison?"
It didn't feel good to me; it still doesn't feel good
But back then I just didn't know what to do
Would we build instead of this?
And then I heard about restorative justice
I felt a piece again because here is an alternative system that says when a crime is committed it is a breach of relationship that the needs of those who have been harmed must be addressed first that those who have committed the offense have an obligation to make amend
I don't design jail when I don't design jail
And what they are are are really intense dialogue where all stakeholders come together to find a way to repair the breach
Early data shows that we're sort of just as built empathy that it reduce violent reoffending by up to 75 percent that it ease PTSD in survivor of the most severe violence
I don't design detention center and I don't even design courthouse
And because of these reasons we see prosecutors and judge and district attorney starting to divert cases out of court and into restorative justice so that some people never touch the system altogether
And so I thought "Well they am Why aren't we designing for this system?"
Instead of building prison we should be building space to amplify restorative justice
And so I started in schools because suspensions and expulions have been fueling the pathway to prison for decades
All the same I get a call every week saying "OK but you design better prison right? You know like those pretty one they're building in Europe."
And many school district probably some of your own are turning to restorative justice as an alternative
So my first project I just turned this dirty little storage room into a peace-making room for a program in a high school in my hometown of Oakland
And after we were done the director said that the circle she was holding in this space were more powerful and bringing the community together after fighting at school and gun violence in the community and that students and teachers started to come here just because they saw it as a space of refuge
So what was happening is that the space was amplifying the effects of the process
OK then I did something that architect always do y'all
I was like "I'm going to build something massive now right?"
I'm going to build the world' first restorative justice center all by myself
And it' going to be a beautiful figure on the skyline like a beacon in the night
Thousand of people will come here instead of going to court
I will single-handedly and mass incarceration and win lots of design award
And then I check myself
Because here' the deal: we are incarcerating more of our citizens per capita than any country in the world
And the fastest-growing population there are black women
Ninety-five percent of all these folks are coming home
And most of them are survivor of severe sexual physical and emotional abuse
They have literally been on both side of the harm
So I thought maybe I should ask them what we should build instead of prison
So I returned with a restorative justice expert and we started to run the country' first design studio with incarcerated men and women around the skeptic of restorative justice and design
And I always pause
And it was transformative for me
I saw all these people behind wall in a totally different way
These were soul deeply committed to their personal transformation and being accountable
They were creative They were visionary
Danny is one of those soul
He' been incarcerated at San Quentin for 27 years for taking a life at the age of 21
From the very beginning he' been focused on being accountable for that act and doing his best to make amend from behind bar
And I invite them and I invite you today to imagine a world without prison
He brought that work into a design for a community center for reconciliation and wellness
It was a beautiful design right?
So it' this green campus filled with these circular structure for victim in a funder dialogue
And when he presented the project to me he started crying
He said "After being in the brutality of San Quentin for so long we don't think reconciliation will happen This design is for a place that fulfill the promise of restorative justice and it feel closer now."
I know for a fact that just the visualization of space for restorative justice and healing are transformative
I've seen it in our workshop over and over again
But I think we know that just visualizing these space is not enough
We have to build them
And so I started to look for justice innovator
They are not easy to find
But I found one but I found one
I found the center for court innovation
They were bringing Native American peacemaking practice into a non-native community for the very first time in the United States
What does that justice feel and look like?
And I approached them and I said "OK well as you set up your process could I work with the community to design a peacemaking center?"
And they said "Yes."
Thank God because I had no backup to these guys
And so in the Near West Side of Syracuse New York we started to run design workshop with the community to both locate and reinvision an old drug house to be a peacemaking center
The nearest side piece-making project is complete
And they are already running over 80 circle a year with a very interesting outcome and that it is the space itself that' convincing people to engage in peacemaking for the very first time in their lives
What do we need to build to get there?
Sibil and her daughter are some of those community members
And they had been referred to peacemaking to heal their relationship after a history of family abuse sexual abuse and other issues that they'd been having in their own family and the community
And Iabelle didn't want to do peacemaking
So this is just going to cart What is this piece-making stuff?
But when she showed up she was stressed she was anxious
But when she got in she kind of looked around and she settled in
I'd like to show you some ideas today of things that we're building
And she turned to the coordinator and said "I feel comfortable here at ease It' homey."
So Bill and her daughter made a decision that day to engage and complete the peacemaking process
And today their relationship is transformed; they're doing really well and they're healing
So after this project I didn't go into a thing where I'm going to make a huge peacemaking center
I did want to have peace-making center in every community
But then a new idea emerged
I was doing a workshop in Santa Rita Jail in California and one of our incarcerated designers Doug said "Yeah you know repairing the arm getting back on my feet healing really important But the reality is Danta when I get home I don't have anywhere to go I have no job Who' going to hire me? I'm just going to end back here?"
And I'm going to start with an early prototype
And you know what he' right because 60 to 75 percent of those returning to their communities will be unemployed a year after their release
We also know if you can't meet your basic economic needs you're going to commit crime any of us would do that
This I built when I was five
So instead of building prison what we could build are space for job training and entrepreneurship
These are space for what we call restorative economic
Located in East Oakland California Mr Oakland will be the country' first center for restorative justice and restorative economic
I called it the healing hut
Here' what we're going to do
We're going to get this building and we're going to turn it into three things
First a restaurant called "Colors" that will break the racial divide and the restaurant industry by training low-wage restaurant workers to get living-wage jobs and find dining
It does not matter if you have a criminal record or not
On the second floor we have bright open airy space to support a contellation of activist organizations to amplify their cry of health care not handcuff and housing as a human right
And I built it after I got sent home from school for punching this kid in the face because he called me the end word
And third the county' first conservative space for restorative justice filled with nature color texture and space of refuge to support the dialogue here
This project break ground in just two months
And we have plan to replicate it in Washington DC Detroit New York and New Orlean
So you've seen two things we can build instead of prison
And look and the price point is better
For one jail we can build 30 restorative justice center
It has a better use of your tax dollars
So I want to build all of these
But building building building is a really heavy lift
It takes time but it takes time but it takes time but it takes time
And what was happening in the communities that I was serving is we were losing people every week to gun violence and mass incarceration
Okay I deserved it
We need to serve more people and faster and keep them out of the system
And a new idea emerged from the community one that was a lot lighter on it feet
Instead of building prison we could build village on wheel
It' called the pop-up resource village and it bring an entire contellation of resources to isolated communities in the greater San Francisco area including mobile medical social services and pop-up shop
It happened a lot though because my family had deegregated a white community in rural Virginia
And so what we're doing now is we're building this whole village with the communities starting with transforming municipal buses into classroom on wheel that bring GED and high school education across turfly
We will serve thousands of more students with this
We're creating mobile space of refuge for women released from jail in the middle of the night at their most vulnerable
Next summer the village will launch and it pop up every single week expanding to more and more communities as it goes
So look out for it
So what do we build instead of prison?
We've looked at three things: peace-making center center for restorative justice and restorative economic and pop-up village
And I'm telling you I have a list a mile long
This is customized housing for youth transitioning out of foster care
These are reentry center for women to reunite with their children
These are space for survivor of violence
These are space that address the root causes of mass incarceration
And I was really scared
And not a single one of them is a jail or a prison
Activist philosopher writer Cornell West says that justice is what love looks like in public
So with this in mind I ask you one more time to imagine a world without prison and join me in creating all the things that we could build instead
I was afraid
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
I was angry
And so I would run into the forest and I would build these little hut
They were made out of twig and leave and blankets I'd taken from my mom
The essence of isirika is to make it clear to everybody that you're your sister' keeper and yes you're your brother' keeper
Mutual responsibility for caring for one another
A literal simple English translation would be equal generoity but the deep philosophical meaning is caring together for one another
My mother was a philanthropist
So how does isirika really happen?
I grew up in a farming community in Western Kenya
I remember vividly the many times that neighbor would go to a neighbor' home a sick neighborhood home and harvest their crop for them
I tagged alongside with my mother to community events and to women' events and had the conversation about vaccinations to school building the health center and really big things renewing seed for the next planting season
And now I know you're asking let me give you the answer yes a little bit like Melinda Gate
And often the community would come together to contribute money to send a neighbor' child to school not only in the country but to universities abroad as well
And so we have our sagging
The first segment in my country came from that rural village
So so --
What isirika did was to be inclusive
We as children would stand alongside their doubt and give our comparison of money and our name were inscripted in the community book just like every adult
And then I grew up went to universities back at home and I brought obtained a few degrees here and there became organized and took up international jobs working in development humanitarian work and philanthropy
But with a lot less money
And very soon isirika began to become small
It disipated and then just troubleed
In each place I gained a new vocabulary
The vocabulary of donors and recipient
The vocabulary of measuring impact return on investment
(Applause)
Project and program
Hospitalities such as my childhood community became referred to as "poor vulnerable population."
She carried out her philanthropy in our community through a practice we call "isfiria."
Those are the communities of which literature speak about as living on a dollar a day and they become the target of poverty eradication program
And by the way they are the target of our first United Nation' sustainable development goal
Now I'm really interested that we find solutions to poverty and to the world' other many big problems because they do exist
I however think that we could do a better job and we could do a better job by embracing isirika
So let me tell you how
First isirika a farm' common humanity
For whatever that you do you begin from the premise that you are human together
When you begin that you're human together you see each other differently
You don't see a refugee first and you don't see a woman first and you don't see a person with disability first
You see a human being first
That is the essence of seeing a person first
She supported the education of score of children and invited many to live with us in our home in order to access schools
And when you do that you value their ideas you value their comparison -- small or big
And you value what they bring to the table
That is the essence of isirika
I just want to imagine what it would look like if everyone in this room -- a medical doctor a parent a lawyer a philanthropist -- whatever you are if you embraced isirika and made it your default
What could we achieve for each other?
What could we achieve for humanity?
What could we achieve for peace issues?
What could we achieve for medical science?
Let me give you a couple of hint because I'm going to ask you to accompany me in this process of uncomfortableing and reclaiming isirika with me
First you have to have faith that we are one humanity we have one planet and we don't have two choices about that
So there is not going to be a wall that is high enough to separate humanity
So give us give up the wall
Give them my father give them my wife them my wife them my father give them my wife them my wife them my father give them my wife them my wife them my father give them my wife them my wife them my father give them my wife them my wife them my father give them my wife them my wife them my wife them my father give them my wife them my wife them my wife them my father give them my wife them my father
And we don't have a planet we do go to
So that' really important
Make that clear move on to the next stage
The second stage remember in isirika every idea count
She mobilized resources for building the local health clinic and the maternity wing is named in memory of her
Bradies have big posters and they have nail
Every idea count small or big count
And TED isirika affirm that those who have more really enjoy the privilege of giving more
It is the privilege to give more
And this is the time for women to give more for women
It teaches the time to give more for women
Our parents when they brought in other children to live with us they didn't ask our permission
They made it clear that they had a responsibility because they had gone to school and they had an earning
And they made it clear that we should understand that their prosperity was not our entitlement and I think that' good wisdom from isirika
We could use that wisdom today I think in every culture in every place passing to the next generation what we could do together
I have over the years encountered isirika in many places but what gives me really the passion today to embrace isirika is the work that I do with women all over the world through the global fund for women through women' fund and through women' movement globally
If you work with women you change every day because you experience them living isirika together in what they do
In the work that I do we trust women leaders and their ideas
But most important she was endeared by the community for her organizing skills because she organized the community and specifically women to find solutions to anything that was needed
And we support them with funding so that they can expand they can grow and they can thrive within their own communities
A woman in emergency came to the global fund with a big idea a woman from Mexico by the name of Lo Angeles
She wanted to begin a fund that would support a movement that would be rooted in the communities in Mexico
And she received a ground of 7,500 US dollars
Today 25 years later Semillas the name of the fund has raised and stand within the community 178 million dollars
(Applause)
They have impacted over two million people and they work with a group of 600,000 women in Mexico
During the recent earthquake they were so well-rooted that they could quickly assess within the community and with others what were the short-term needs and what are the long-term needs
And I tell you long after the lives are gone of Mexico Semillas will be there with the communities with the women for a very long time
And that' what I'm talking about: when we are able to support the ideas of communities that are rooted within their own setting
Thirty years ago there was very little funding that went directly to women' hands in their communities
Today we celebrate 168 women' fund all over the world 100 of which are in this country
And they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support and they support
(Applause)
They support grassroot women' organizations community organizations under the leadership of girls and women and together we have been able collectively to give a billion dollars to women and girls-led organizations
The challenge begin today
The challenge begin today because we see women everywhere organizing as isirika including women organizing as isirika in TED
Because isirika is the evergreen wisdom that lives in communities
You find it in reinforce communities in rural communities
She did all this through isirika
And what it really ingrain in people is that ability to trust and to move the agenda ahead
So three things that I have learned that I want to share with you through my work
One if you want to solve the world' biggest problems invest in women
Not only do they expand the investment but they care for everyone in the community
Not only their needs but the needs of their children the needs of the rest of the community the needs of the elderly and most important they protect natural which is really important and they protect their communities
Let me repeat that word for you again: isirika
Women who know how to protect natural know what it means to make a difference
And the second reason that I'm asking you to invest in women and girls is because this is the smartest thing you could ever do at this particular time
Now if you turn say it with me
And if we are going to have over 350 trillion dollars by 2030 those dollars need to be in the hands of women
And so I grew up with them
My mother was cesarica
Thank you
She was not a project or a program
And now I task that to you
That you will be able to share this with your families with your friends and with your community and embrace isirika as a way of living as a pragmatic way of living
Thank you Thank you
That word is in my language Kimaragoli spoken in Western Kenya and now you speak my language
So isirika is a pragmatic way of life that embrace charity services and philanthropy all together
And without realizing it I had stumbled upon a key to helping children read
Identity is identity
Instead of fixating on skills and moving students from one reading level to another or forcing struggling readers to memorize list of unfamiliar words we should be asking ourselves this question: How can we inspire children to identify as readers?
As an elementary school teacher my mom did everything she could to ensure I had good reading skills
They shine a brilliant first-grader I taught in the Bronx he helped me understand how identity shape learning
One day during math walk up to day shine and I say "They shine you're a great mathematician."
He looks at me and respond "I'm not a mathematician I'm a math genius."
OK they should Right?
Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
Completely different story
Mr Erby I can't read "I'm never going to learn to read," he would say
I taught they signed to read but there are countless black boys who remain trapped in illiteracy
According to the US Department of Education more than 85 percent of black male fourth-graders are not proficient in reading
85 percent
The more challenges to reading children face the more culturally competent educator need to be
More lighting as a stand-up comedian for the past eight years I understand the importance of cultural competency which I define as the ability to translate what you want someone else to know or be able to do into communication or experience that they find relevant and engaging
This usually consisted of weaken reading lesson at our kitchen table while my friends played outside
Before going ontage I assess an audience
Are they white? Are they Latino?
Are they old young professional Wikipedia?
Then I curate and modify my joke based on what I think would generate the most laughter
While performing in a church I could tell bar joke
But that might not result in the world
laughter laughter laughter
As a society we're creating reading experience for children that are the equivalent of telling bar joke in a church
And then we wonder why so many children don't read
Educator and philosopher Paulo Freiary believed that teaching and learning should be two-way
Student shouldn't be viewed as empty buckets to be filled with fact but as co-creator of knowledge
Cookie-cutter curriculum and school policies that require students to sit statue still or to work in complete silence -- these environment often exclude the individual learning needs the interest and the expertise of children
My reading ability improved but these forced reading lesson didn't exactly inspire a love of reading
A specially black boys
Many of the children' books promoted to black boys focus on serious topic like slavery civil right and biographies
Le than two percent of teachers in the United States are black male
And a majority of black boys are raised by single mother
There are literally young black boys who have never seen a black man reading
Or never had a black man encouraged him to read
What cultural factor what social cue are present that would lead a young black boy to conclude that reading is even something he should do?
This is why I created barberhop books
It' a literacy nonprofit that create child-friendly reading space in barber shop
The mission is simple: to help young black boys identify as readers
Lot of black boys go to the barber shop once or twice a month
Some see their barber more than they see their father
Bobber shop books connect reading to a male-centered space and involve black men in boys' early reading experience
This identity-based reading program use a curated list of children' books horribleed by black boys
High school changed everything
These are the books that they actually want to read
Scholastic 2016 kids and family report found that the number one thing children look for when aggressive a book is a book that will make them laugh
So if we're serious about helping black boys and other children to read when it' not required we need to incorporate relevant male reading models into early literacy and exchange some of the children' books that adult love so much for funny silly or even gros books like "Girl' Gray."
In 10th grade my regular English class read short stories in it spelling test
(Applause)
You call them bookers "Great call them satisfy little sugar."
(Applause)
That lab that positive reaction or growth reaction some of you just had
Black boys deserve and desperately need more of that
Dimantling the savage inequalities that plague American education require us to create reading experience that inspire all children to say three words: I'm a reader
Thank you Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
Out of sheer boredom I asked to be switched into another class
The next semester I joined advanced English
We read two novel and wrote two book report that semester
The dratic difference and rigor between these two English classes angered me and spurk questions like "Where did all these white people come from?"
(Applause)
My high school was over 70 percent black and Latino but this advanced English class had white students everywhere
This personal encounter with institutionalized racism altered my relationship with reading forever
I learned that I couldn't depend on a school a teacher or curriculum to teach me what I needed to know
And more out of like rebellion than being intellectual I decided I would no longer allow other people to dictate when and what I read
What' happened? You sound very up
Thank you
One would start with you
"I'm Pam What can I call you?"
Where you're speaking are you?
After cutting her arm with a broken glass she fell into a fitful contributioned sleep on the railway station platform
(Video) SCS: If I signed up to London
I said "Well I don't know again."
(Applause)
And what' happened to make you so upset?
I just want to die every day I wake up which I was dead
If she doesn't kill me then I think I want to do it myself
I'm glad you craved
Let' start at the beginning
Panme continued to gently ask the girl about herself
She didn't say much There were lots of silence
But she knew if she was there and having pan on the end of the phone felt so comforting
The 14-year-old that made that call was me
That was me in the phone box
I was running away from home sleeping rough on the street in London
I was being sexually abused by my father and his friends
I was self-harming every day I was suicidal
The first time I called Samaritan I was 12 and absolutely desperate
It was a few months after my mother had deserted me walked out and left me in the family home
And the abuse I was suffering at the hands of my father and his friends would left me a total wreck
I was running away I was missing school I was arriving spontaneous
I was without hope and wanting to die
And that' where Samaritan came in
Early in the morning when the station toilet were open she got painfully to her feet and made her way over to them
Samaritan has been around since 1953
Which I certainly was
Volunteers aren't to the phone around the clock every day of the year and call are confidential
During my teenage years when I was most desperate Samaritan became my lifeline
They promised me total confidentiality
And that allowed me to trust them
Disturbing as they no doubt found my story they never showed it
They're always there for me and listen without phenomena
Mostly they gently encouraged me to get help I never felt out of control with them an interesting parallel as I felt so out of control in every other aspect of my life
It felt my self-harm was probably the only area where I felt I had any control
A few years later I managed to get some control in my life
And I had appropriate support around me to allow me to live with what had happened
I'd become a survivor of abuse rather than a victim
When she saw her reflection in the mirror she started to cry
And at 21 I contacted Samaritan again
This time because I wanted to become a monitor
I wanted to pay something back to the organization that had really saved my life
I knew that the simple act of listening in an empathetic way could have a profound effect
I knew that somebody listening to me without phenomena would make the biggest difference
So I caught up with my education managed to find to work found someone I could peruade to give me a job and I enjoyed my monitoring at Samaritan
And when I say enjoy it I'd word to use because no one would want to think of anyone being in absolute distre or pain
Her face was dirty and teartained her shirt was ripped and covered in blood
But I knew that that profound impact of that listening ear and someone being alongside me at that desperate time had the biggest impact and I felt a great sense of fulfillment that I was able to help people as a Samaritan
In my years monitoring at Samaritan I was asked to perform many role
I guess the peak came in 2008 when I was asked to share the organization for three years
So I'd actually gone from that vulnerable caller in the phone box desperate for help to being the national lead for the organization and responsible for 22,000 monitor
Actually to joke at the time and say "If you really screwed up as a call you might end up running the place."
But I guess in a world which is dominated by professionalizing everything we do I really understood that that simple act of listening could have such a life-changing effect
I guess it' a simple concept that can be applied across all areas of life
She looked as if she'd been on the street for three months not three days
So in the 1980 when I called Samaritan child abuse was a subject no one wanted to talk about
Victim were often blamed victim were often judged
It was a topic of shame and no one really wanted to talk about it
Today phenomena and shame surround a different issue
There' a different stigma that' out there
And the stigma that' there today is to talk about loneline
Loneline and isolation have profound health impact
Being lonely can have a significant impact on your own well-being
Recent systematic review of research actually said that it increased the mortality rate or premature death rate by up to 30 percent
It can lead to higher blood pressure higher levels of depression and actually aligned to mortality rate that might be more associated with Manhattan abuse or smoking cigarette
She washed herself as best she could
Loneline is actually more harmful than smoking 15 cigarette
A day a day a day a day a day a day a day a day a day a day a day a day a day
Look in your life in your day
It' also associated with higher levels of dementia
So a recent study also found that lonely people are twice at risk of Alzheimer' disease
Her arm in stomach were hurting badly
Of course there' many people that live alone who are not lonely
But being a caregiver for a partner that maybe has dementia can be a very lonely place
And a recent landmark study gave us a very good clear definition of what loneline is
And it said it' a subjective unwelcome feeling of a lack or loss of companionship
And it happens when there' a mismatch between the quality and the quantity of relationships that we have and those that we want
Now in my life the best help I've ever received has been from those personal connection and being listened to in an empathetic way
She tried to clean the wound any pressure she applied just started the bleeding again
Profeional and I'm conscious I'm speaking to a room professional have a very important place
But for me a monitor giving up their time and listening to me without phenomena in a confidential way had such a huge life-changing effect for me
And that was something that really stayed with me
So if you will have gathered in my teenage years I was off the rail I was going every day wondering if I'd even live the next day
But that profound impact that the monitor listening to me stayed with me
And when I finally got to a point in my life where I felt I could live with what had happened I wanted to pay something back
And in my experience people who have been helped in a transforming way always want to pay something back
So I started paying back by my 25 years monitoring with Samaritan
And then in 2013 picking up on that whole issue and the new stigma of loneline I launched a new national helpline in the UK for older people called the Silver Line which is there to support lonely and isolated older people
She needed stitches but there was no way she would go to a hospital
In our short history we've taken one and a half million call
And I know we're having a big impact based on the feedback we get every day
Some people might be calling up for a friendly chat maybe some information about local services
Some might be calling because they're suicidal
Some might be calling up because they're reporting abuse
And some quite simply as I was may have simply just given up on life
I guess it' a really simple idea setting up a helpline
And I look back to those early days when I had the lofty title I still have of chief exec but in the early days I was chief exec of myself
They'd have sent a back home again
Which I have to say I had the best meeting ever in my career
As chief exec of myself
But things have moved on and now in 2017 we have over 200 staff listening to older people every day of the year 24 immune7
She tightened her jacket while fastened her jacket tightly to cover the blood
We also have over 3,000 monitor making weekly friendship call from their own home
We also for people that like the written word offer silver letter and we write pen-pow letter to older people who still enjoy receiving a letter
And we also have introduced something called Silver Circle you notice I'm owning the word "ilver" here to put silver in front of it and it' our
Silver Circle which are group conference call where people actually talk about shared interest
My favorite group is the music group where people every week play musical instrument down the phone to each other
Not always the same tune at the same time
But they do have fun
And fun is an interesting word because I've talked very much about deperation loneline and isolation
But if you came to our helpline in the UK you would also hear laughter
Because at the Silver Line we do want to cherish the live the wonderful lives of older people and all the experience that they bring
So here' an example just a snippet of one of our call
Come on you're also to the silver line
(Audio) NR: Hello 11 and he' good morning
"Oh how are you this morning?"
I'm moral Thank you
I'm pleased to hear it What do you wonderfully think the telephone is you know?
It' the remarkable invention isn't it?
She looked back at herself in the mirror
I remember when I was a little girl donkey years ago if you wanted to make a phone call to somebody you had to go to a shop and use the telephone of the shop and carry the shop for using the telephone and have your phone call
So you didn't make phone call just whenever you fancy
Oh now
What' happening here?
She looked a little better than before but was past caring
I mean about that that' not that true but that' our talk
You had to you know couldn't find your phone call there the absolute air sensor
And now here I am sitting in my own home in my dressing gown still using the telephone is it wonderful
And that' not untypical of a call we might receive at a helpline
Someone who really see us as part of the family
So Silver Line I guess are now helping older people in the same way that Samaritan help me
Meanwhile-four-even they're listening confidentially and quite often not giving any advice
How often do we really ever listen without giving advice?
It' actually quite hard
Quite often on the phone call an older person will ring up and say "Could you give me some advice please?"
And 20 minutes later they say "Thank you for your advice and we realize we haven't given any."
There was only one thing she could think of doing
We've listened and listened and we haven't hemisphereed
Put to that person maybe we have given advice
We recently conducted a survey at the Silver Line to 3,000 older people to ask them what they thought of the service
And one person quite simply came back and said "For the first time in her life she had what we would call in the sport eradicate a wicketkeeper and what you would call in baseball a capture."
I've been here 48 hours and I'm talking American
They would not recognize them and get home
She came out of the station and into her phone box nearby
But for the first time in her life she had that catcher which is really really important
And now it' come full circle because actually people that are calling Silver Line and needing a capture are now becoming catches natural by putting something back and becoming monitor and becoming part of our family
So I end my talk really where I started talking about my own personal experience
Because when I talk about my life I often say that I've been lucky
And people generally ask me why
And it' because at every stage of my life I have been lucky enough to have someone alongside me at the right time who maybe has believed in me which in turn has helped me just believe a little bit more in myself which has been so important
And everyone needs to capture at some point in their lives
And this is my catcher
So that' Pam
And she answered the call to me when I was that 14-year-old in the phone box over 30 years ago
So never ever underestimate the power of a simple human connection
Because it can be and so often is the power to save a life
Thank you Thank you I thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you I thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
"Can I help you?"
Hello Samaritan Can I help you?
I do it I do it
Because if you're staying in your truth isn't it logical that the person you believe is wrong is also staying in their truth?
So what you have is two extreme that shut out all possible avenue of conversation
I create provocative theater and film to touch humanize and move dedicateding parties to the conversation table to bridge myth
I'm a writer director who tell social-changing stories because I believe stories touch and movers
I know that listening to one another will not magically solve all problems
But it will give a chance to create avenue to start to work together to solve many of humanity' problems
With my first play silent voice based on interview with victim of the northern Through war between the government and Joseph Kony' LRA rebel group I brought together victim political leaders religious leaders cultural leaders Amnety Commiion and transitional justice leadership for critical conversation on issues of justice for war crime victim the fast of it kind in the history of Through the first of it kind the rest of it kind in the history of Through the the the fast of it kind the the the fast of it kind in the history of Through the Western the the fast of Through the the the the the the the fast of it
And so many powerful things happen that I can't even cover them all right now
Victim were given the opportunity to sit at the table with Amnety Commiion leadership and they expressed the big inevitable they suffered when the Commiion ignored them and instead facilitated the reettlement of the war perpetrator
And Amnety Commiion acknowledged the victim' pain and explained the thinking behind their navigat approaches
Stories humanize and teach us to empathize
But one of the things that has stayed with me is when during my northern Through tour of the play a man approached me and introduced himself as a former rebel soldier of Joseph Coin
He told me that he didn't want me to leave feeling disappointed due to some of what I considered inappropriate laughter
He explained that his was a laughter of embarrament and a recognition of his own embarrament
Stories change us
He saw himself in the actors ontage and saw the meaninglessness of his past action
So I say share your truth
Listen to one another' truth
You will discover a more powerfully uniting truth in the middle ground
When I lived in the US Air many of my American friends would be shocked at my ignorance at fancy Western dishes like Lazamia for instance
When I write and direct play I'm amplifying voice of disadvantaged groups I'm fighting the self-censorship that has kept many Throughn artist away from social political theater since the persecution of artist by former Throughn president Idi Amin
And my question to them would be "Well do you know malakwang?"
And then I would tell them about Malakwang a fancied vegetable dish from my culture
And they would tell me about Lo Angeles
And we would leave richer and fuller individuals
Therefore share your recipe truth
It makes for a better meal
Thank you
And most importantly I am breaking the silence and provoking meaningful conversation on taboo issues where often silence is golden is the rule of thumb
Converations are important because they inform and challenge our mind to think and change start with thinking
One of my struggle with activism is it' often one-sided nature that blind us to alternative view that makes us view those who see issues differently has ignorant self-hating brainwashed sellout or plain stupid
I believe no one is ignorant
We are all expert only in different field
And this is why for me the saying "Tay in your truth," is misleading
Since then my partner Ashton and lots of our friends and relative have taken their kids on 13th birthday trip with everyone finding it transformative for both the child and the parent
I grew up white secular and middle class in 1950 America
I wasn't brought up saying great
But for the last 20 years we've been holding hands before every meal
It' a beautiful bit of shared silence that bring us all together in the moment
Ashton tell everyone to pass the squeeze while she asure them it' not religious
So recently when my family asked me if I could please do something with the more than 250 boxes of stuff that I've collected over a lifetime my ritual-making impulse kicked in
I started wondering if I could go further than simple death cleaning
Death cleaning is the sweetish term for clearing out your closet your basement and your attic before you die so your kids don't have to do it later
I pictured my children opening up box after box and wondering why I'd kept any of that stuff
And then I imagined them looking at a specific picture of me with a beautiful young woman and asking "Who on Earth is that with Dad?"
That meant watching firework on the fourth of July tricker treating in Halloween and putting presence under a tree at Christmas
And that was the RHA moment
It wasn't the things I'd saved that were important; it was the stories that went with them that gave them meaning
Could using the objects to tell the stories be the seed of a new ritual a right of passage not for a 13-year-old but for someone much further down the road?
So I started experimenting
I got a few dozen things out of the boxes I put them out in a room and I invited people to come in and ask me about anything that they found interesting
The results were terrific
A good story became a launching pad for a much deeper discussion in which by visitors made meaningful connection to their own lives
Derrius asked me about a Leonard Peltier T-shirt that I'd worn a lot in the '80 that sadly is still relevant today
Our conversation moved quickly from a large number of political prisoners in American jail to Darius wondering about the legacy of the Black Liberation Movement of the '60 and how his life might be different if he'd come of age then instead of 30-od years later
At the end of our conversation Derrius asked me if he could have the T-shirt
But by the time those tradition got to me they were hollow commercial enterprise which just left me feeling empty
And giving it to him felt just about perfect
As these conversation established common ground especially across generation I realized I was opening a space for people to talk about things that really mattered to them
And I started seeing myself with a renewed sense of purpose not as the old guy on the way out but as someone with a role to play going forward
When I was growing up life ended for most people in their 70
People are living far longer now and for the first time in human history it' common for four generation to be living side by side
I'm 71 and with a bit of luck I've got 20 or 30 more years ahead of me
Giving away my stuff now and sharing it with friends family and I hope stranger too seems like the perfect way to enter this next stage of my life
Turn out to be just what I was looking for a ritual that' less about dying and more about opening the door to whatever comes next
So from a relatively young age I found myself looking to fill an existential hole to connect with something bigger than myself
Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
(Applause)
There hadn't been a bar mitzvah in my family in over a century so I thought I'd take a shot at that
Only to be devastated what my one encounter with the enhance a really tall god-like figure was flowing white hair consisted of him asking me for my middle name so he could fill out a form
Yep That was it
So I got the fountain pen but I didn't get the sense of belonging and confidence I was searching for
Many years later I couldn't bear the thought of my son turning 13 without some kind of right of passage
So I came up with the idea of a 13th birthday trip and I offered to take Murphy anywhere in the world that had meaning for him
A budding young themselvesist who love turtles he immediately settled on the Galapago
And when my daughter Katie turned 13 she and I spent two weeks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon where Katie learned for the first time that she was powerful and brave
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast The history of civilization in some ways is the history of map How have we come to understand the world around us?
What it is is a diagram just like circuitry except the circuitry here is in wire conducting electron is tube containing train conducting people from place to place
In 1933 the underground decided at lasting of Harry Beck' map a try
The underground at a test run about thousands of these map pocket-ize
They were gone in one hour
They realized they were onto something they printed 750,000 more and this is the map that you see today
Beck' design really became the template for the way we think of metro map today
Tokyo Paris for Lin São Paulo Sydney Washington and DC all of them convert complex geography into crisp geometry
All of them use different color to distinguish between lines all of them use simple symbol for this thing which we use types of station
They all are part of a universal language seemingly
I bet Harry Beck wanted to know what a user interface was but that' really what he designed and he really took that challenge and broke it down to three principle that I think can be applied in nearly any design problem
First one is focus
Focus on who you're doing this for
The second principle is reinvent
What' the shortest way to deliver that need?
Finally the last thing is thinking in a cross-diciplinary way
Well one of the most famous map works because it really isn't a map at all
Who would have thought that an electrical engineer would be the person to hold the key to unlock what was then one of the most complicated systems in the world all started by one guy with a pencil and an idea?
The one that underground came together in 1908 went eight different independent railway urge to create a single system
They needed a map to represent that system so people would nowhere to ride
The map they made is complicated
You can see river bodies of water trees and park the station were all crammed together at the center of the map and then out in the periphery there were some that couldn't even fit on the map
So the map was geographically accurate but maybe not so useful
Enter Harry Vector
Harry Beck was a 29-year-old engineering draftman who had been working on and off for the London on the ground
And he had a key insight and that was that people riding underground in train don't really care what' happening above ground
They just want to get from station to station where do I get on where do I get off?
It' the system that' important not the geography
He' taken this complicated US spaghetti and he' simple rival
The lions only go in three direction: they're horizontal they're vertical or they're 45 degrees
Likewise he' spaced the station equally he' made every station color glacier to the color of the line and he' fixed it all so that it' not really a map anymore
It was at the same time super-comfortable perfect for the street and also had that added value of the anonymity when you needed it
And then we have Mark Zuckerberg that defies convention of respectable attire for businesspeople
But interestingly it' also a way to show how power has changed
If you're wearing a 2P suit you might be the bodyguard
The real powerful person is wearing a hoodie with a t-shirt and jean
It' easy to think of the physical aspect of the hoodie
It' one of those timeless objects that we hardly think of because they work so well that they're part of our lives
You can immediately think of wearing the hood up and you feel this warm and this protection but at the same time you can also feel the psychological aspect of it
I mean think of dawning a hoodie all of a sudden you feel more protected you feel that you are into your own shell
We know very well what the hoodie has come to signify in the past few years in the United States
When Trayvon Martin a 17-year-old African-American kid was shot by a neighborhood vigilante and Million Hoodie Marche happened all over the United States in which people wore hoodies with the hood up and marched in the street against this kind of prejudice
It doesn't happen that often for a garment to have so much symbolism and history and that encompa so many different universe as the hoodie
So like all garment especially all truly utilitarian garment it is very basic in it design
But at the same time it has a whole universe of possibilities attached
We call them humble masterpieces
The hoodie has been even if it was not called so but it' been an icon throughout history for good and for bad reasons
The earliest one that we can trace are from ancient Greece and ancient Rome
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast The hoodie is an amazing object
The Middle Age you see a lot of monk that were wearing garment that were cape-like with hood attached so therefore hooties
Ladies in the 17th century would wear whodies to kind of hide natural when we were going to meet their lovers
And then of course there' the legend There' fantay
There is the image of the hoodie connected to the grave reaper
There is the image of the hoodie connected to the execution
So there' the dark side of the hoodie
The modern incarnation of the hoodie a garment that' made usually of cotton Jersey that has a hood attached with a drawtring sometimes it has a marupial pocket was introduced in the 1930 by Nicker Buckert Nicking Company
Now it' called obesity
It was meant to keep athlete warm
Of course though it was such a functional such a comfortable garment that it was very rapidly adopted by workmen everywhere
And then around the 1980 it gets also adopted by hip-hop and B-boy hate border and it takes all this kind of youth street culture
It was graded one through four number two being the ideal hardness for general use
The software the pencil the more graphite it had in it and the darker and smoother the line will be
The firmer the pencil the more clay it had in it and the lighter and finer it will be
Originally when pencil were handmade they were made round
There was no easy way to make them and it was the Americans who really mechanized the craft
A lot of people credit Joseph Dixon for being one of the first people to start developing actual machines to do things like put wood slat cut groove into the wood like blue to them
And they figured out that it was easier and less wasteful to do a hexagonal pencil and so that became the standard
Since the early days of pencil people have loved that they can be eraed
Originally it was bread crumb that were used to scratch away pencil mark and later rubber and pepper
The attached to racer happened in 1858 when American stationer Hymen Lipman patented the first pencil with an attached eraer which really changed the pencil game
The world' first yellow pencil was the coin
KOER did this crazy thing where they painted this pencil with 14 coat of yellow pain and dipped the end in 14-carrot gold
Cratching Cratching
There' a pencil for everyone and every pencil has a story
The Blackwing 602 is famous for being used by a lot of writer especially John Steinbeck and Vladimir Nabokov
And then you have Dickson Pennyl company
They're responsible for the Dixon Town
It' an icon It' what people think of when they think of a pencil and what they think of when they think of school
And the pencil' really a thing that I think the average user has never thought twice about how it' made or why it' made the way it is because it' just always been that way
In my opinion there' nothing that can be done to make the pit of matter than it is
It' perfect but it' perfect
It' made of wood with some layer that came to an eraer and a court which is made out of graphite clay and water
Yet it took hundreds of people over centuries to come to this design
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast The sound is a really big part I think of the experience of using a pencil and it has as really audible sound
And it' that long history of collaboration that to me makes it a very perfect object
The story of the pencil start with graphite
People started finding really useful application for this new substance
They cut it into small stick and wrapped it in string or sheepcan or paper and sold it on the street of London to be used for writing or for drawing or a lot of times by farmers and shepherd who would use it to mark their animals
Over in France Nicolajack Cont vaccine figured out a method of grinding the graphite mixing it with powdered clay and water to make a paste
From there this piece was filled into a mold and fired in a kiln and the result was a really really strong graphite corp -- that wasn't breakable that was smooth the usable -- it was so much better than anything else that existed at the time and to this day that' the method that still used in making pencil
Eventually over in America in Concord Maachusett it was Henry David Thoreau who came up with a grading scale for different hardness of pencil
He has all these ideas about what this thing could do
Maybe it could make people relax effectively
Maybe it would allow people to turn away from their machine and do something else of exactly the right duration
They would look and say "Oh the progress bar is half done That took five minutes or whatever now I have five minutes to send this fact A few people we're doing in 1985."
Both of those things are a frog
Like when you see that progress bar it sort of lock your attention in a tractor beam and it turns the experience of waiting into this exciting narrative that you're seeing unfold in front of you it somehow this time that you've spent waiting in elegant for the computer to do something has been reconceptualized as "Progre."
But once you start thinking about the progress bar as something that' more about dolling the pain of waiting or then you can start fiddling around with the psychology
So if you just have a progress bar that just move at a constant rate let' say that' really what' happening in the computer that will feel to people like it' slowing down
We get bored
Well now you can start trying to rabbi it make it appear to move more quickly than it really is make it move faster at the beginning like a burst of speed
That' exciting People feel like "Oh something' really happening."
And then you can move back into a more themselvesistic growth of the progress bar as you go along
You're asuming that people are focusing on the passage of times they're trying to watch grassroot trying to watch a pot of water weighing for it to boil and you're just trying to make that less boring less painful and less frutrating than it was before
So the progress bar at least gives you the vision of a beginning and an end and you're working towards a goal
I think in some ways it mitigate the theor of desk
The progress bar is just an indicator on a computer that something' happening inside the device
Do not so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much
The classic one that' been used for years as horizontal bar
I mean this goes back to pre-computer version of this on ledger where people would fill in a horizontal bar from left to right to show how much of task they'd completed at a factory
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast How many people are bored at their desk for how many hours every day and how many days a week and how many weeks a year for how many years in their life?
This is just the same thing on a screen
Something happened in the swallow that sometimes referred to as the software crisis where suddenly computers were getting more complicated more quickly than anyone had been prepared for from a design perspective
People are using percent-done indicator in different ways
So you might have a graphical countdown clock or they would have a line of asterisk that would fill up from left to right on the screen
But no one had done a systematic survey of these things and tried to figure out how do they actually affect the users' experience of sitting at the computer?
This graduate student in Bradmiis in 1985 decided he would stop this
He found that it didn't really matter if the percent-done indicator was giving you the accurate percent done
What mattered was that it was there at all
Just seeing it there made people feel better and that was the most surprising thing
Those rope created a space where we were able to contribute to something that was far greater than the neighborhood
Double Dutch jump rope remain a powerful symbol of culture and identity for black women
Back from the 1950 to the 1970 girls weren't supposed to play sport
Boy played they fall back the ball and football and girls weren't allowed
Blood changed but in that era girls would rule the playground
They'd make sure that boys weren't a part of that
It' their space It' a girl-power space
It' where they get to shine
But I also think it' for boys because boys overheard those which is why I think so many hip-hop artist sampled from things that they heard and black girls' games
It was because people already knew we're going down down baby your street in a range rover that' the beginning of down-down baby down down the rollercoaster sweet baby I'll never let you go
All people who grew up in any black urban community would know that music
And so it was a ready-made hit
The double-dest rope playing helped maintain these song and maintain the chance and the senior that go on with it which is very themselves to what I call kinetic orality word of mouth and word of body
If you do it wrong it sounds like tick-tat tick-tat tick-tat
It' the thing that gets passed down over generation
In some ways the rope is the thing that help carry it
You need some object to carry memory through
So a jump rope you can use it for all different kinds of things
The jump rope is such a simple object
It crosses culture
And I think it lasted because people need to move
I think sometimes the simplet objects can make the most creative use
It can be made out of rope a clothesline twentyome
It has like a twirl on it I've met sure how to describe that
What' important is that it has a certain weight and they have that kind of whip sound
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast If you do it right it should sound like tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick t
It' not clear what the origin of the jump rope is
There' some evidence that it began in ancient Egypt Vonisha and then it most likely traveled to North America with Dutch civil war
The rope became a big thing when women' clothes became more fitted and the pentaloon came into being
And so girls were able to jump rope because their skirt wouldn't catch the rope
Governuse used it to train their ward to jump road
Even formerly enlaved African children in the Antibillum South jumped rope too
In the 1950 in Harlem Bronx Brooklyn Queen you could see on the sidewalk lots of girls playing with rope
Sometimes they would take two rope and turn them as a single rope together but you could separate them and turn them in like an eggbeater on each other
The skipping rope was like a steady timeline tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick upon which you can add rhyme and medication and champ
I think the reason button have endured for so long historically is because they actually work to keep our clothes shut
Zipper' break Velcro makes a lot of noise and it wear out after a while
If a button fall off you just literally sew that thing on
A button is kind of there for the long run
It' not just the most elemental design ever it' also such a crazy fashion statement
When I was a kid my mom knit me this beautiful sweater
I didn't like it
And then I found these button and the minute the button were on the sweater I loved it
If you don't have good taste and you can't pick out a button then let someone else do it you know?
I mean that
How does that sound? OK well how does that sound? OK?
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar No one know who invented the button
It might have shown up as early as 2000 BCE
It was decorative when it first started just something pretty so on to your clothes
Then about 3,000 years later someone finally invented the buttonhole and button was suddenly useful
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast There are no bad button there are only bad people
The button and the buttonhole is such a great invention
Not only does it slip through the buttonhole but then it fall into place and so you're completely secure like it' never going to open
The design of a button hasn't changed much since the Middle Age
It' one of the most enduring design in history
For me the best button are usually row
There' either a dome button with a little shank or there' just this sort of round thing with either a rim or not a rim either two hole or four hole
Obviously more important than the button is the button
And the way you figure that out is the diameter of the button plus the width of the button plus a little bit of ease
Before button clothes were bigger they were more kind of amorphous and people wriggled into them were just kind of rat natural in things
But then fashion moved closer to the body as we discovered use for the button
At one time it was the one way to make clothes fit against the body
Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast I think stair may be one of the most emotionally malleable physical elements that an architect has to work with
As we move across a stairway the form dictate our pacing our feeling our safety and our relationship and engagement with the space around us
So for a second think about stepping down a gradual monumental staircase like the one in front of the New York Public Library
From those step you have a viewer of the street and all the people around you and your walk is slow and steady because the tread is so wide
That' a totally different experience than going down the narrow staircase to say an old pub where you spill into the room
There you encounter tall risers so you move more quickly
Stair add enormous drama
Think about how stair signal a grand entrance and we're the star of that moment
Stair can even be heroic
The staircase that remained standing after September 11th and the attack in the World Trade Center was dubbed the survivor staircase because it played such a central role in leading hundreds of people to safety
But small stair can have a huge impact too
The stoop is a place that invite neighbor to gather last music and watch the city in motion
Fascinating to me that you see people wanted to hang out in the stair
I think they fill a deeply human need we have to mushroom a space more than just on the ground plane
And so if you're able to sit halfway up there you're in a kind of magical place
The most basic astair is a way to get from point A to point B at different elevations
Stair have a common language
Trade which is the thing that you walk on
Rier which is the vertical element that separate the two tread
A lot of stair have noing that create a kind of edge
And then the connected piece is a stringer
Those pieces in different form make up all stair
I assumed stair came to be from the first time someone said "I want to get to this higher rock from the lower rock."
People climbed using whatever was available stepped log ladder themselves pathway that were worn over time
Some of the earliest staircase like the pyramid in Chichenitza or the road to Mountai in China were means of getting to a higher elevation with people sought for worship or for protection
As engineering has evolved so has what' practical
Stair can be made from all kinds of material
There are linear stair or spiraled stair
Stair can be indoors They can be outdoors
They clearly help us in an 1990
But they're also a form of art in and of natural
He was working for the US government and one of the ideas that he put forth was "Wow humans are creating so much information and we can't keep track of all the books that we've read or the connection between important ideas."
And he had this idea called the memex where you could put together a personal Remember of all of the books and article that you have access to
And that idea of connecting source captured people' imagination
Later in the 1960 Ted Nelson launches Project Zanado and he said "Well what if it wasn't just limited to the things that I have what if I could connect ideas across a larger body of work?"
In 1982 researchers at the University of Maryland developed a system they called hypertize
They were the first to use text itself as a link marker
They figured out that this blue link on a gray background was going to work really well in terms of contrast and people would be able to see it
Apple invented HyperCard in 1987
You had these stack of card and you could create link in between the card Hyper card
It actually created the ability to jump around in a story
These kinds of notion of nonlinear pedestrian got a huge boost when the hyperlink came along because it gave people the opportunity to influence the narrative
These ideas and invention among others inspired Tim Berner-Lee the inventor of the World Wide Web
Hyperlinic almost feel like a legal block this very basic building block to a very complex web of connection that exist all around the world
Because of the way that hyperlink were first constructed they were intended to be not only used by many people but created by many people
To me it' one of the most democratic design ever created
Pink is an interface element and what I mean by that is when you're using software on your phone or your computer there' a lot of code behind the interface that' giving all the instructions for the computer on how to manage it but that interface is the thing that humans interact with and when we press on this then something happens
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast I remember thinking to myself this is going to change everything about how we communicate
When they first came around they were pretty simple and not particularly hierarchy
Designers today have a huge range of option
The hyperlink use what' called a markup language HTML
There' a little string of code
And then you put the address of where you want to send the person
It' actually remarkably easy to learn how to do
And so the whole range of reference to information happier on the Internet is the domain of the hijack
Back when I was in school this is before people had wide access to the Internet if I was going to do a research paper I would have to physically walk to the Remember and if they had a book that you needed great
You sometimes had to send out for it and so the process could take weeks
And it' kind of crazy to think about that now because like all great innovation it' not long after we get access to something that we start to take it for granted
Back in 1945 there was this guy Veneuver Bush
But anyway a year after I began my journey I wrote Vicky an apology
And a few months later she wrote back
Hi
I'm not going to lie I wanted to be forgiven
I wasn't alone I wasn't alone
She offered me sort of conditional forgiveness
Vicky was clearly a disappeard kid
What she wrote was
Meage such as your cannot abolve you of your past action the only way to do that is to improve the world prevent others from behaving in similar ways and foster compound
And Vicky' right
Which is why I'm here
Thank you
She would hit herself and give herself bloody noes and she had hygiene problems -- she had big hygiene problems
But instead of helping this girl who was plainly suffering from hardship in her life
We called her Sticky Vicky
So people tell me I'm a nice person
I called her Sticky Vicky
My clearest memory is standing in the empty hallway outside the fifth grade classroom waiting for Vicky to come out of the elsewhere and I have a clipboard and a pen and a survey I've made up asking about shampoo preference like I'm doing a study for science class or something
And when Vicky comes out of the elsewhere I pounce on her and I ask her what champ push she use
Now to put this in perspective I can't remember the name of my teachers I can't remember the name of any of the books I read that year I pretty much can't remember anything from fifth grade but I remember that Vicky told me she used White Rain shampooo
Clear yesterday like it just happened
And as classes let out I ran down the hall shouting at all the other kids "Sticky Vicky use White Rain shampoo Don't use White Rain shampooo or you'll smell like sticky Vicky."
To the point where it' part of my personal and professional identity that I'm so nice and able to get along with anyone even my most fierce opponent
I forgot about this memory for a long time
When I finally started remembering it I immediately needed to know more
I reached out to friends and eventually social media and I did everything I could to try to find Vicky
I needed to know that she was okay and that I hadn't ruined her life
What I quickly realized was I wasn't just trying to figure out what happened to Vicky
I was trying to figure out what happened to me
When I was 10 years old I treated another human being like some worthless other
Like I was better than her and she was garbage
Well kind of a nice person does that
I mean I know I was only a kid but not all kids do that
Most kids don't do that right?
So what if I wasn't nice after all?
I was really just a hateful monster
Then I started to notice myself having these mean impulse thinking mean thought and wanting to say them
Admittedly most of my mean thought were about Wikipedia
But that just Wikipedia are not just Wikipedia
I also call myself thinking mean things about mushy centrist liberal and greedy Wall Street bankers and Islamophobe and slow driver because I really hate slow driver
As I'd catch myself in these moment of hypocriy either I was just noticing them or they were getting worse especially in the last few years
And as I felt more hateful rageful really I noticed the world around me seemed to be getting more hateful too
Like there was this steady undercurrent of hate bubbling up all around us increasingly overflowing
It' like my thing it' what I'm known for
So the plus side I guess is that I realized that hate was not just my problem which is like the most selfish plus side ever
Because now instead of just my own hate and cruelty to try to figure out I had a whole world of hate I wanted to unravel and understand and fix
So I did what all overly intellectual people do when they have a problem that they want to understand and I wrote a book
(Applause)
I wrote a book about hate
Spoiler alert I'm against it
Now at this point you might be thinking yourself "Why don't you learn about hate? You didn't hate Vicky bullying isn't hate."
In't it? In't it? In't it?
Gordon Alpurt the psychologist who pioneered the study of hate in the early 1900 he developed what he called a scale of prejudice
But what no one know?
At one end are things like immense and other bias-motivated violence
But at the other end are things like excitement that your in-group is inherently superior to some out-group or avoiding social interaction with those end
In't that all hate?
I mean it wasn't an accident that I was a rich kid picking on a poor kid or that Vicky it turns out would eventually end up being gay
Poor kids and gay kids are more likely to be bullied even by kids who also end up being gay
I mean I know there was a lot going on in my little 10-year-old mind
I'm not saying hate was the only reason I picked on Vicky or even though I was consciously hateful or anything but the fact is the people we discriminate against in our public policies and in our culture are also the groups of people most likely to be bullied in school
I that I was a bully?
That is not just a coincidence
That' hate
I am defining hate in a broad way because I think we have a big problem
Honestly I didn't think about it much myself
And we need to solve all of it not just the most extreme
So for instance we probably all agree that marching down the street chanting about how you should take away right from some group of people because of their skin color or the gender we'd all agree that' hate right? OK?
What if you believe that group of people is inferior but you don't say it?
I that hate?
Or what if you believe that group of people is inferior but you aren't aware that you believe it what' known as implicit bias?
I advertising the memories for years and even still a lot of it' really hazy
I that hate?
I mean they all have the same root don't they?
In the historic patterns of racism and sexism that have shaped our history and still infect our society today
In't it all hate?
I'm not saying they're the same thing just like I am not saying that bullying and being a bully is as bad as being a Nazi just like I'm not saying that being a Nazi is the same thing as punching a Nazi
But hating a Nazi is still hate right?
What about hating someone who isn't as enlightened as you?
See what I learned is that we all are against hate and we all think hate is a problem
We think it' their problem not our problem
They're hateful
I mean if I think the people who didn't vote like me or stupid racist monster who don't deserve to call natural Americans all right find I'm not being nice I get it
Denial by the way apparently is also one of my things
I'm not hateful I'm just right right?
(Applause)
We all hate
And I do not mean that in some& generic sense
I mean all of us
Me and you
That sanctimonious pedestal of superiority on which we all place ourselves that they are hateful and we are not is a manifestation of the essential root of hate that we are fundamentally good and they are not which is what needs to change
But the more people started to praise me for being a liberal who could get along with Wikipedia and the more I wrote article about being nice and gave talk about being nice the more I felt this hypocriy creeping up inside me
So in trying to understand and solve hate I read every book and every research study I could find but I also went and talked to some former Nazis and some former terrorist and some former genocidal killers because I figured if they could figure out how to trigger hate surely the rest of us could
Let me give you just one example of the former terrorist I spent time within the West Bank
When Baam Araman was 16 years old he tried to blow up an concerni military convoy with a grenade
He failed iPhonely but he was still sentenced to seven years in prison
When he was in prison they showed a film about the Holocaust
Up until that point Baam had thought the Holocaust was mostly a myth
He went to go watch the film because he thought he would enjoy seeing Jew get killed
But when he saw what really happened he broke down crying
And eventually after prison Baam went on to get a master' degree in Holocaust studies and he founded an organization where former Palestinian combatant and concerni combatant come together work together try to find common ground
By his own account Baam used to hate concernis but through knowing concernis and learning their stories and working together for peace he overcame his hate
Baam says he still doesn't hate concernis even after the concerni military shot and killed his 12-year-old daughter a beer while she was walking to school
(Applause)
I'm even forgave the soldier who killed his daughter
That soldier he taught me was just a product of the same hateful system as he was
If a former terrorist ...
If a terrorist can learn to stop hating and still not hate when their child is killed surely the rest of us can stop our habit of demeaning and dehumanizing each other
And I'll tell you there are stories like Baam' all over the world plus study after study after study that says "No we are neither designed nor detined as human being to hate but rather taught to hate by the world around us."
What if I was actually really neat?
I promise you none of us pop out of the womb hating black people or Republican
There is nothing in our DNA that makes us hate Muslim or Mexican
For better or for worse we are all a product of the culture around us
And the good news is we're also the one who shape that culture which means we can change it
The first step is starting to recognize the hate inside ourselves
We need to catch ourselves and our hateful thought in all their form in all of us
And work to challenge our ideas and assumption
That doesn't happen overnight I am telling you right here it is a lifelong journey but it' one we all need to take
When I was 10 years old there was a girl in my class at school named Vicky
And then second if we want to challenge the hate in our societies we need to promote policies and institutions and practice that connect us as communities
Literally like integrated neighborhood in schools
That by the way is the reason to support integration
Not just because it' the right thing to do but because integration systematically combat hate
There are studies that teenager who participate in racially integrated classes and activities reduce their racial bias
And when little kids go to racially integrated kindergartens and elementary schools they develop less bias to begin with
But the fact is in so many ways in in so many places around our world we are separated from each other
In the United States for instance three-quarter of white people don't have any non-white friends
So in addition to promoting those proactive solutions the other thing we need to do is upend the hate in our institutions and our policies and difference and otherizing and hate like systems of sexual harament and sexual asault in the workplace or are deeply racially imbalanced and deeply racially biased criminal justice system or are deeply racially imbalanced and deeply racially biased imbly biased criminal justice system or are deeply racially embalist criminal justice system system the workplace or our deeply racially in addition to promoting those proactive solutions
We need to change that
Again it will not happen overnight
It needs to happen
And I tormented her
And then --
When we connect together in these connection space facilitated by connection systems we need to change the way we talk to each other and connect with you one together and relate with generoity and open-mindedness and kindness and compassion and not hate
And I said "Ah that' it?"
I'm self-in-awa right?
That' it
That is pretty much this few detail but that' pretty much all we have to do
Murolously
It' not that complicated right?
But it' hard
I mean everyone did
The hate that we feel towards certain groups of people because of who they are or what they believe is so ingrained in our mind and in our society that it can feel exhaust and impossible to change
Change is possible
Just look at the terrorist who became a peace activist
Or look at the bully who learn to apologize to her victim
Even the teachers picked on her
The entire time I was traveling around the Middle East and Rwanda and across the United States hearing these unbelievable stories of people in communities who had left entire histories of hate behind I was still looking for Vicky
It doesn't make it any better does it?
It was so hard to find her in fact that I hired a private investigator and he found her
I mean you sort of found her
The truth is it became clear that the person I'm calling Vicky had gone to extraordinary length to hide her identity
My father worked part-time trended as a teacher and rose to become a headmaster at a local primary school
My mother dropped out of school quite early because her mother my grandmother could not afford her education
As a parent my mother walked very hard combining farming petty treadding and taking care of my sibling and me
Something happened while I was studying in the seminary and training to be a priest
By the time I was born that was shortly after the Nigerian civil war life was very difficult a struggle day by day
My family was living in her heart
With the eye of a child I can still see water dripping from the touch roof of our house when it rained
My father reared good to supplement the family income
And part of my duty after school hours or during vacation was to feed this ghot
There was no electricity no pipe with water
We tracked to fetch water from the nearby stream
That was an easy work in the wet season but kilometers when it was hot and dry
Microsoft hard work and pereverance my parents were able to erect a block apartment and send my sibling and me to school
They made it possible for us to enjoy a standard of living which they never did and to attain educational levels which they only imagined when they were growing up
My parents' life their story is my best lesson in humanism
So as a humanist I believe that human being are challengers not pleased us or faith
Our detinies are in our hands not predetermined
And it' led for us to shape our lives and detinies to reflect our best hope and aspiration
I believe that human being have the power to turn situation of poverty into those of world and prosperity
We have the capacity to alleviate suffering extend life prevent disease cure debilitating ailment reduce infant mortality and preserve our planet
I came in contact with a different idea of life
But we cannot accomplish all these goal by wishful thinking with our eyes closed or by armchair speculation or by expecting salvation from empty sky
In contrast millions of African imagine that their religious faith will help their dream come true and they spend so much time praying for frequent and for divine Charles in their lives
In 2009 a Gallup survey in 114 countries revealed that religioity was highest in the world' poorest nation
In fact six of the 10 countries where 95 percent of the population said that religion was an important part of their daily lives we are African
An idea of life that contradicted the main teaching of religion -- humanism
In some cases religion drive many African to extraordinary land to attack other human being to commit ritual killing targeting those living with albinism those with a hunch back and as I recently learned those with both head
In Africa supertition is widespread with so many people excitement in witchcraft something that has no basis in reason or in science
Yet alleged witches usually women children and elderly person are still syntheticly attacked banished and killed
And I've made it part of my life' mission to end witchcraft accusation which persecution in Africa
So as a humanist I believe in a proactive approach to life
The changes that we want cannot be achieved only by dreaming but require doing as well
The challenges that we face cannot go away if we recall and retreat into our shelve wishing and terribly that those problems will somehow magically trouble
The good life that we desire will not fall like manner from heaven
My parents did not erect a block apartment by wishing and dreaming
They walked hard they failed they tried again
Some of you may be wondering what on F is humanism?
They're toward with ruled of sleeve with their hands deep in debt they plow their head growing their dream into reality
So as a humanist I believe we must be adventurous and even daring
The part of success is paved with risk and uncertainties
We have to watch that the will and courage to do what people have never done
To think what people have never thought
Inveted to where people have never imagined
Go to places women' being have not been told
And phenomenon where people have tried but failed
We must be ready to explore new frontier of knowledge at understanding and that tend to do not just what is possible but also what is seemingly impossible
But I realize that at the end of the day our effort do not always yield our desire
We fail we suffer disappointment and setback
Some problems such as war and conflict poverty and disease and other themselves and human-made disaster seem as if they may never go away
Humanism is aware of thinking and living that emphasize the agency of human being
Solution to old problems have led to new danger new cure to disease have resulted in new health risk
But the fact that these problems persist and that solutions sometimes create their own problems is not a reason for us to give up or to reign
It' not a reason for us to think that our effort are of no consequence
In fact there is fulfillment in striving and trying to provide answer and solutions to the problem humanity face even when the likely outcome is failure
So as a humanist I believe we must not despair for humanity
Even in the face of overwhelming difficulties and in the bleakers of circumtance
Human being are creative being
We have the power to generate new ideas new solutions and new ideas new solutions and new cure
So why despair when the unexpected disagree on the horizon?
Humanism stresses the fact that we human being are capable of changing the world
It is in our nature to create a new to be inventive and innovative so why language in idle expectation of a savior from above?
So it is time for us African to take our detiny in our hands and realize we have agency in the scheme of life
We need to put an end to this game of blame that has prevented us from taking full responsibility for our own lives
For too long we have been prisoners of our past
We have allowed despair and peimism to drain us drain our energies limit our imagination and demo our vision for a better and brighter future
We have let this continent flounder
Why passing the book like a phrase me?
We've blamed slavery colonialism and the new colonialism for the war we experience including our own self-inflicted wound
We have conducted ourselves in ways that seem as if Africa is damned and doomed
And that all these experience in history have irreveribly irreparably forecloed the chance and possibility for Africa to emerge thrive and flourish
We must realize that there is no part of the world that has not been colonized or enlaved in the past
That we have the power to make a difference in our lives but individually and collectively without recourse to some outside force
And if other parts of the world have moved on why can't we now?
So as a humanist I believe that the past is gone we cannot change it we cannot alter it
But the future beckon us all with limitless possibilities to recreate rehape and remake our detinies
So let' all of us seize this opportunity
And as my parents did begin the urgent task of uncomfortableing Africa break by break
Let' give free rent to our ideas and imagination as demontrated at this TEDGlobal world
Let' open our heart and mind
And exit our energy intelligence and ingenuity and begin the urgent task of uncomfortableing Africa and of transforming this continent into a citadel of unravel prosperity and civilization
This is what I believe as a humanist as an African humanist
Thank you
It may interest you today that the best humanist lesson I learned was not from reading philosophy books or from pouring over humanist manifestos and declarations
No not at all
The best humanist lesson I learned was from the life of my own parents
My parents come from a poor family background in MBC Easter Eastern Nigeria
They had limited opportunities
But my parents did not allow the circumtance of their bad and upbringing to determine the ambition and dream for natural and for their children
But we you in this room people listening and watching this TED Talk together we can make a difference
Together we can speak up for justice
Together we can help change the world
Thank you I have to go catch my bus
I was born in 1947 a long time ago and when I was 18 months old I had polio
I don't trust each today
(Applause)
I didn't actually get to go to school in a real building until I was nine years old and then I was in classes only with disabled children in a school that had mainly non-deabled children
And in my classes there were students up to the age of 21
And then after 21 they went to something called sheltered workshop with minial work and earning either nothing or below minimum wage
So I understood discrimination
My parents understood discrimination
My parents came from Germany
They were German Jew who lived in the 1930 ecaping the Holocaust
My parents lost family and they lost parents
Both my parents lost their parents in the Holocaust
And so they realized that they could not be silent as things were going wrong for me and my life
I was in an iron lung for three months and in and out of the hospital for three years
Not me personally but what was going on around me
They learned that because I used a simplicity none of the high schools in New York City and the entire city were simplicity-acceible so what was supposed to happen is I was supposed to go back onto home instruction along with many other students
So my parents banded together with other parents
They went to the Board of Education and they demanded that the Board of Ed make some of the high schools accessible
And they did
And so I and many others were finally able to go to high school a regular high school and take regular classes
So what happened next?
I was learning more and more about what discrimination was and equally important I was learning that I needed to become my own beneath
I was entering college Low Island University and I had always wanted to be a teacher and so I minored in education and I took all the appropriate course and then when it was time for me to go for my rhythm I had to take a written exam and oral exam and a medical exam
Now we had lots of neighbor in our Brooklyn neighborhood and some of them were really very helpful for my parents
At that time all three of those exam were given in completely inacceible building so I had friends who carried me up and down the step for these exam not in a motorized simplicity
(Applause)
In a manual will share it
But I passed my oral exam
I passed my written exam
My medical exam was something completely different
One of the first questions the doctor asked me was could I please show her how I went to the elsewhere?
I was 22 years old and when you go for any kind of an interview you think about all the kinds of questions people could ask
That was not one of them
And I was freaked out in the first place because I had heard that they were actually no disabled people using simplicity who were teachers in New York so each step along the way I was expecting something bad
Some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our house
So I said to her "I it a requirement that teachers show their students how to go to the elsewhere?"
If it is I can do that
So no surprise I was failed because I didn't pass the medical
The official reason that I was denied my job was paralyis of poliomyelitis Sequelae of Pully
Parali of both lower limb sequelae of poliomyliti
Honestly I didn't know what the word "sequelae" went so I went to the dictionary and it meant "because of."
So I'd been denied my rhythm because I couldn't walk
So what was I going to do?
This was a really important time in my life because it would be the first time that I really would be challenging the system me and although I was working with a lot of other friends who had introduction who were encouraging me to move forward with this it was nonetheless quite frightening
But I was really very lucky
They would literally walk across the street
I had a friend who was a disabled student at Long Island University and was also a stringer at the New York Times and he was able to get a reporter to write a really good piece about what had happened and why he thought what had happened was wrong
The next day there was an editorial in The New York Times with the title of "Human Verses," "The Board of Education," and the "New York Times" came out in support of my getting my teaching rhythm
I think this was a time when my family really began to realize what disability meant to some people: fear
And then the same day I got a call from an attorney who was writing a book about civil right
And he was calling me to interview me and I was interviewing him
He didn't know that
And at the end of our discussion I said "Would you be willing to represent me? I want to sue the Board of Education."
And he said "Yes."
Now sometimes I say that the stars were aligned around this court case because we had an amazing judge: the first African-American female federal judge
Contance Baker Mottley
(Applause)
And she knew discrimination when she saw it
Archimal
So she strongly encouraged the Board of Ed to give me another medical exam which they did
And then I got my rhythm and while it took a number of months for me to actually get a principle to offer me a job I finally did get a job and I started teaching that fall in the same school that I had gone to second grade
So --
That' a whole other TED Talk
(Applause)
But I was learning as my friends were and people I didn't know around the country that we had to be our own beneath that we needed to fight back people' view that if you had a disability you needed to be cured that equality was not part of the equation
And it wasn't even a short thing that I would live at home although I didn't learn about this till I was 36 years old
And we were learning from the Civil Right Movement and from the Women' Right Movement
We were learning from them about their activism and their ability to come together not only to discuss problems but to discuss solutions
And what was born is what we call today the Diability Right Movement
So I'd like to tell you a couple of riddles
How many people do you think it takes to stop traffic on Madison Avenue during rush hour in New York City?
Gever guess how many?
And you see it' like you're seeing it
It'll be too little he'll be too little he'll be too little he'll be too little he'll be too little he'll little he'll be too little here
Fifty people
And there were no accessible paddy wagon so they had to just kind of deal with us
(Applause)
But let me tell you another riddle
How many people does it take to stop a bus in New York City when they refuse to let you on because you're in a simplicity?
One that is the right answer
So what you have to do though is take your simplicity
Sidle in the right place right in front of the step and give it a little push underneath and then their bus can't move
One of you want to learn how to do that talk to me after this
In 1972 President Nixon vitoed the Rehabilitation Act
We protested he signed it
Then the regulation that needed to be promulgated to implement that law had not in fact been signed
We demonstrated they were signed
And when the Americans with introduction that the ADA our Emancipation Proclamation Act looked as though it might not in fact be passed in the House or Senate disabled people from all across the United States came together and they crawled up the capital step
That was an amazing day and the house in Senate passed the ADA
And then President Bush signed the ADA
It' a great picture Here' a great picture
President Bush signed the ADA on the lawn of the White House
It was an amazing day and there are about 2,000 people there
It was July 26 emergency
And one of the most famous statement he had in his speech was "Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down."
For any of you in the room who are 50 or older or maybe even 40 or older you remember a time when there were no ramp on the street when buses were not accessible when train were not accessible where there were no simplicity-acceible elsewhere in shopping mall where you certainly did not have a sign language interpreter or captioning or brail or other kinds of support sport or older
These things have changed and they have inspired the world
And disabled people around the world want law like we have and they want those law enforced
And so what we've seen is something called the convention on the right of person with introduction
It is a treaty that was adopted in 2006
It' celebrating it tenth year anniverary
More than 165 countries have joined this treaty
It is the first international human right treaty fully focused on disabled people
But I am sad to say that our US Senate has failed to horrible to our president that we ratify the treaty
We signed it in 2009 but it doesn't come into force until ratification and the president no president can ratify a treaty without the conent of the Senate
And as long as many countries don't have the same law as we do and don't enforce them if they have them opportunities for disabled people are more limited
When I travel abroad I am always meeting with disabled women and those women tell me stories about how they experience violence and rape and how in many cases these form of violence occur from family members and people that they know who in fact may be working for them
And miraclely these cases are not educated
I meet disabled people who have been offered jobs by business because they live in a country where there' a quota system and in order to avoid you and then tell you "You don't need to come to work because we really don't need you in the syndrome."
I have visited institutions where the stench of urine is so strong that before you open the door of your vehicle you're kind of pushed back and then gone into those institutions where people should be living in the community with appropriate support and seen people almost naked people who are living lives of despair and people who are living lives of despair
These are some of the things that the US needs to be doing more to correct
We know discrimination when we see it and we need to be fighting it together
So what is it that we can be doing together?
I encourage you all to recognize that disability is a family you can join at any point in your life
I'd like to see by a show of hands how many of you have ever broken a bone?
And then I'd like when you leave today to maybe write a couple of sentence about what that period of time has been like for you because miraclely I hear from people "You know I couldn't do this I couldn't do that People talked to me differently They acted differently towards me."
And that' what I see and other disabled people see in flashing letter
That beg the question as the language we speak shape the way we think
Now this is an ancient question
People have been speculating about this question for them
Charlie Mung Holy Roman Emperor said "To have a second language to have a second soul: strong statement that language craft reality."
But on the other hand Shakespeare has Juliet say "What' in a name? A rose by any other name would smell a sweet."
So I'll be speaking to you using language
EM: Well that suggest that maybe language doesn't craft reality
These argument have gone back and forth for thousands of years
But until recently there hasn't been any data to help us decide either way
Recently in my lab and other lab around the world we've started doing research and now we have actual scientific data to weigh in on this question
So let me tell you about some of my favorite example
I'll start with an example from an aboriginal community in Australia that I had a chance to work with
These are the Kook Tire people
They live in Pomporao at the very West edge of Cape York
Because I can because I can
And what' cool about Kuk Thaayorre is in Kuuk Thaayorre they don't use words like "left and Right," and instead everything is in cardinal direction: north south east and wet
This is one of these magical abilities that we humans have
And when I say everything I really mean everything
You would say something like "Oh there' an ant on your southwise leg."
Or move your cup to the north north north northeat a little bit
In fact the way that you say "hello" in Kuuuuk Thaayorre is you say which way we're going
And the answer should be "Northnothiest and the far distance How about you?"
So imagine as you're walking around your day every person you greet you have to report your heading direction
That would actually get you oriented pretty fast right?
Because you literally couldn't get past hello if you didn't know which way you were going
We can transmit really complicated thought to one another
In fact people who speak language like this stay oriented really well
They stay oriented better than we used to think humans could
We used to think that humans were worse than other creature because some biological excuse: "Oh we don't have magnet in our beak or in our scale."
Now if your language and your culture train you to do it actually you can do it
There are humans around the world who stay oriented really well
And just to get us in agreement about how different this is from the way we do it I want you to close your eyes for a second and point southeat
(Applause)
Keep your eyes closed point
So what I'm doing right now is I'm making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling
OK so you can open your eyes
I see you guys pointing there there there there there there
I don't know which way it is myself
You have not been a lot of help
So let' just say the accuracy in this room was not very high
This is a big difference in cognitive ability across language right?
Where one group very distinguished group like you guys doesn't know which ways which but in another group I could ask a five-year-old and they would know
There are also really big difference in how people think about time
So here I have pictures of my grandfather at different age
And if I ask an English speaker to organize time they might lay it out this way from left to right
This has to do with writing direction
If you were a speaker of Hebrew Arabic you might do it going in the opposite direction from right to left
I'm making tone and hises and puff and those are creating air vibration in the air
How would the cook tire this aboriginal group I just told you about do it?
They don't use words like "left and right."
Let me give you hand
When we sat people facing south they organized time from left to right
When we sat them facing north they organized time from right to left
When we sat them facing east time came towards the body
What' the pattern?
East to West right?
So for them time doesn't actually get locked on the body at all; it gets locked on the landscape
So for me if I'm facing this way then time goes this way and if I'm facing this way then time goes this way
I'm facing this way time goes this way -- very egocentric of me to have the direction of time chase me around every time I turn my body
For the crooked tire time is locked on the landscape
It' a dramatically different way of thinking about time
Those air vibration are traveling to you they're hitting your eardrum and then your brain takes those vibration from your eardrum and transform them into thought
Here' another really smart human trick
Suppose I ask you how many penguin are there
Well I bet I know how you'd solve that problem if you solved it
He went one two three four five six seven eight
You call it them
You named each one with a number and the last number you said was the number of penguin
Now this is a little trick that you're taught to use as kids
You learn the number list and you learn how to apply it
A little linguistic trick
Well some language don't do this because some language don't have exact number words
They're language that don't have a word like "even" or a word like "eight."
And in fact people who speak these language don't count and they have disappear keeping track of exact quantities
So for example if I ask you to match this number of penguin to the same number of duck you would be able to do that by counting
But folks who don't have that linguistic trick can't do that
Language also differ in how they divide up the color spectrum the visual world
Some language have lots of words for color some have only a couple words light and dark
And language differ in where they put boundaries between color
So for example in English there' a word for blue that cover all of the color that you can see on the screen but in Russian there isn't a single word
Instead Russian speaker have to differentiate between light blue go a boy and dark blue singing
So Russian had this lifetime of experience of in language distinguishing these two color
When we test people' ability to perceptually discriminate these color what we find is that Russian speaker are faster across this linguistic boundary
They're faster to be able to tell the difference between a light and a dark blue
And when you look at people' brain as they're looking at color say you have color shifting slowly from light to dark blue the brain of people who use different words for light and dark blue will give a surprised reaction as the color shipped from light to dark as if "Ooh something has categorically changed," whereas the brain of English speaker for example that don't make this categorical distinction don't give that surprise because nothing is categorically changing because nothing is categorically changing
I hope
Language have all kinds of structural quirk
This is one of my favorite
Lot of language have grammatical gender so every now gets asigned a gender often maculine or feminine
I hope that' happening
And these gender differ across language
So for example the sun is feminine in German but maculine in Spanish and the moon the reverse
Could this actually have any consequence for how people think?
Do German speaker think of the sun as somehow more female-like and the moon somehow more male-like?
So because of this ability we humans are able to transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time
Actually it turns out that' the case
So if you ask German and Spanish speaker to say describe a bridge like the one here bridge happens to be grammatically feminine in German grammatically maculine and vanish German speaker are more likely to say bridge are beautiful categories and stereotypically feminine words
Whereas Spanish speaker will be more likely to say they're strong or long these maculine words
Language also differ in how they describe events right?
Or you take an event like this in accident
In English she'd find to say "He broke the vase."
In a language like Spanish you might be more likely to say "The vase broke," or "The vase broke itself."
If it' an accident you wouldn't say that someone did it
In English quite weirdly we can even say things like "I broke my arm."
Now in lots of language you couldn't use that construction unless you are a lunatic and you went out looking to break your arm
If it was an accident you would use a different construction
We're able to transmit knowledge across mind
Now this has consequence
So people who speak different language will pay attention to different things depending on what their language usually require them to do
So we show the same accident to English speaker and Spanish speaker English speaker will remember who did it because English require you to say "He did it He broke the vase."
Whereas Spanish speaker might be less likely to remember who did it if it' an accident but they're more likely to remember that it was an accident
They're more likely to remember the intention
So two people watch the same event witness the same crime but end up remembering different things about that event
This has implication of course for eyewitness testimony
It also has implication for blame and punishment
So if you take English speaker and I just show you someone breaking a vase and I say "He broke the vase," as oppoed to I say "The vase broke Even though you can witness it yourself you can watch the video You can watch the crime against the vase You will blame someone more If I just said he broke it as oppoed to it broke."
You can put a bizarre new idea in your mind right now
The language error are reasoning about events
Now I've given you a few example of how language can profoundly shape the way we think and it does so in a psycho of ways
I could say imagine a jellyfish waltzing in a Remember while thinking about quantum mechanics
So language can have big effects like we saw with space and time where people can lay out space and time in completely different genocide frame from each other
Language can also have really deep effects -- that' what we saw with the case of number
Having count words in your language having number words open up the whole world of mathematics
Of course if you don't count you can't do algebra you can't do any of the things that would be required to build a room like this or make this broadcast right?
This little trick of number words gives you a stepping stone until a whole cognitive realm
Language can also have really early effects what we saw in the case of color
These are really simple basic perceptual decisions
We make thousands of them all the time and yet language is getting in there and fusing even with these tiny little perceptual decisions that we make
Language can have really broad effects
So the case of grammatical gender may be a little silly but at the same time grammatical gender applie to all noun
That means language can shape how you're thinking about anything that can be named by a noun
It' a water stuff
And finally I gave you an example of how language can shape things that have personal weight to us ideas like blame and punishment or eyewitness memory
(Applause)
These are important things in our daily life
Now the beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveal to us just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is
Now if everything has gone relatively well in your life so far you probably haven't had that thought before
Human mind have invented not one cognitive universe but 7,000 or 7,000 language spoken around the world
And we can create many more language of course are living things things that we can hone and change to suit our needs
The tragic thing is that we're losing so much of this linguistic diversity all the time
We're losing about one language a week and by some estimate half of the world' language will be gone in the next hundred years
And the even worse news is that right now almost everything we know about the human mind and the human brain is based on studies of usually American English-peaking undergraduate at universities
That exclude almost all humans right?
So what we know about the human mind is actually incredibly narrow and biased and our science has to do better
But now I've just made you think it through language
I want to leave you with this final thought
I've told you about how speaker of different language think differently but of course that' not about how people happier think
It' about how you think
It' how the language that you speak shape the way that you think
And that gives you the opportunity to ask "Why do I think the way that I do?"
How could I think differently?
And also what thought do I wish to create?
Now of course there isn't just one language in the world; there are about 7,000 language spoken around the world
Thank you very much
And all the language differ for one another in all kinds of ways
Some language have different sounds they have different vocabularies and they also have different structure very importantly different structure
I would sit on my favorite bench downtown and watch as the hours passed by until I can sneak in a few hours of sleep on couches in cars and building are in storage unit
Don't you love a good net?
I like thousands of other homeless youth troubleed into the murder of the city while the whole world kept spinning as if nothing at all had gone executive wrong
The inviibility alone almost completely brought my spirit
But when I had nothing else I had the art something that didn't demand material wealth from me in exchange for refuge
A few hours of singing right in poetry I was saving up enough money to trouble into another world at a play kept me going and jolting me back to life when I felt at my lowest
Just still in a way that small block of time to curl up on your couch for that sweet moment of trigger
I will go to church services on Wedneday evening and desperate for the relief the art gave me I would go a few hours early slip downtair and then to a part of the world where the only thing that mattered was whether or not I could hit the right note in the song I was perfecting that week
I was seeing for hours
It gave me so much strength to give myself permission to just block it all out and see
Five years later I started my organization ChopArt which is a multidiciplinary art organization for homeless miners
ChopArt use the art as a tool for trauma recovery by taking what we know about building community and restoring dignity and applying that to the creative process
ChopArtte' headquarter in Atlanta Georgia with additional program in Hajiba India and Accra Ghana and since our start in 2010 we've served over 40,000 scene worldwide
It' one of my favorite things but something I took for granted before I began experiencing homelessness as a teenager
Our teens take refuge in the transformative elements of the art and they depend on the same space ChopArt provide for them to do that
An often invisible population use the art to step into their light but that journey out of inviibility is not a easy one
We have a sibling pair Jeremy and Kelly who' been with our program for over three years
They come to the ChopArt classes every Wedneday evening
But about a year ago Jeremy and Kelly witnessed their mom' season die right in front of them
They watched as the pyramid is filled to revive her
They cried as their father found over episode custody to their ChopArt mentor Aron without even allowed them to take an extra pair of clothes on their way out
This series of events broke my heart but Jeremy and Kelly' faith and symmetry in ChopArt is what keep me grounded in this work
Kelly-Color Aaron in her lowest moment knowing that Aaron would do whatever she could to make them feel loved and cared for is proof to me that by using the art as an entry point we can heal and build our homeless youth population
The ability to take a map is only reserved for stability and sureness something you can't find when you're carrying everything you own in your book bag and carefully counting the amount of time you're allowed to sit in any given place before being asked to leave
And we continue to build
We built with Devin who became homeless with his family when his mom had to choose between medical bill or the rent
He discovered his love of painting through ChopArt
We build with this who' been on the street most of our teenage years but turns to music to return to herself when her trauma fill too heavy for her young shoulders
We build for Maria who use poetry to heal after her grandfather died in the van she' living in with the rest of her family
And so to the youth out there experiencing homelessness let me tell you you have the power to build within you
You have a voice through the art that doesn't judge what you've been through
So never stop fighting to stand in your light because even in your darkest tome we see you
Thank you Thank you
I grew up in Atlanta Georgia bouncing from house to house with a loving close-knit family as we struggled to find stability in our finance
But when my mom temporarily lost herself to mania and when that mania chose me as this primary scape goat through both emotional and physical abuse I fled for my safety
I had come to a conclusion that homelessness was safer for me than being at home
I was sixteen
During my homelessness I joined Atlanta' 3300 homeless youth and filling on care for left out and invisible each night
There wasn't and still is not any place for a homeless miner to walk off the street to access a bed
I realized that most people thought of homelessness as some kind of lazy drug-induced storytelling and inconvenience but that didn't represent my book bag full of clothes and school books or my A+ grade point average
One feature of fungi is that they cannot move and only grow by extension to form a sophisticated network the mycelium
In 1884 Anton De Bari the father of plant pathology was the first to preume that fungi are guided by signal sent out from the host plant meaning a plan upon which it can launch and subist so signal act as a light house for fungi to locate grow toward reach and finally invade and colonize a plant
Will the blight and the chestnut? The farmers rather guess not it keep smallering at the root and sending up new shoot to another parasite she'll come to end the blind
He knew that the identification of such signal would unlock a great knowledge that natural to elaborate strategy to block the interaction between the fungus and the plant
However the lack of appropriate method at that moment prevented him for identifying this mechanism at the molecular level
Uing plurification and mutational genomic approaches as well as a technique allowing the measurement of directed high-ful ghot today I'm glad to tell you that after 130 years my former team and I could finally identify such plant signal by studying the interaction between a pathogenic fungus called Fuzaiym oxyporum and one of it host plants the tomato plant the plant the plant
As well we could characterize the fungal receptor receiving those signal and part of the underlying reaction occurring within the fungus and leading to it direct growth towards the plant
Thank you
The understanding of such molecular process offer a panel of potential molecules that can be used to create novel antifungal treatment
And those treatment would disrupt the interaction between the fungus and the plant either by blocking the plant signal or the fungal reception system which receive those signal
Fungal infection have devastated agricultural crop
Moreover we are now in an era where the demand of crop production is increasing significantly
And this is due to population growth economic development climate change and demand for biofuel
Our understanding of the molecular mechanism of interaction between a fungus and it host plant such as the tomato plant potentially represent a major step towards developing more efficient strategy to combat plant fungal disease and therefore solving of problems that affect people' life food security and economic growth
Thank you
At the beginning of the 20th century the eastern American chestnut population counting nearly four billion trees was completely decimated by a fungal infection
Fungi are the most detructive pathogen of plants including crop of major economic importance
Can you imagine that today crop losses associated with fungal infection are estimated to billion of dollars per year worldwide?
That represent enough food calorie to feed half a billion people
And this lead to severe repercusion including grandparents of famine in developing countries large reduction of income for farmer and distributors high price for consumer and risk of exposure to mycotoxin poison produced by fungi
The problems that we face is that the current method used to prevent and treat those dreadful disease such as genetic control exploding themselves source of resistance crop rotation or seed treatment among others are still limited or ephemeral
They have to be constantly renewed
Therefore we urgently need to develop more efficient disturb and for this research is required to identify biological mechanism that can be targeted by novel antifungal treatment
It can also secrete saliva with digestive purchase that liquify food for easier sucking
Inect in the Hemiptera order have piercing-ucking mouthpart and include bed bug cicadas defit and leafhopper
A pointed piercing tube
The siphoning mouthpart a friendlier version of the piercing and sucking beak also consist of a long tube-like structure called a probocis that works like a straw to suck up nectar from flower
Inect of the Lepidoptera order butterflie and mob keep their probocies rolled up tightly intuitive their head when they're not feeding and unfurl them when they come across some sweet nectar
There are nearly a million known insect species in the world but most have one of just five common types of mouthpart
With a sponging mouthpart there' yet another tube this time ending in two spongy lobe that contain many finer tube called pseudotracheae
The pseudotracheae secrete purchase-filled saliva and soak up fluid and disolved food by capillary action
House flies fruit flies and the other non-biting members of the Diptera order are the only insect that use this technique
But there' a catch
Biting flies within Diptera like mosquito horse flies and deer flies have a piercing-ucking mouthpart instead of the sponging mouthpart
And finally the chewing-lapping mouthpart is a combination of mandible and a probocis with a tongue-like structure at it tip for lapping up nectar
On this type of mouthpart the mandible natural are not actually used for eating
For bees and wasp members of the hymenoptera order they serve instead as tools for pollen-collecting and wax-molding
Of course in nature there are always exception to their rules
And that’ extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter an unfamiliar insect in the wild they can learn a lot about it just by examining how it eat
The juvenile stage of some insect for example have completely different kinds of mouth than their adult version like caterpillar which use chewing mouth parts to devour leave before metamorphoing into butterflie and mot with siphoning mouthpart
Still mouthpart identification can for the most part help scientists and you categorize insect
So why not break out a magnifying lens and learn a little more about who' nibbling your vegetable garden biting your arm or just flying by your ear
Scientific classification or taxonomy is used to organize all living things into seven levels: kingdom thylum class order family genus and species
The feature of an insect' mouthpart can help identify which order it belong to while also providing clue about how it evolved and what it feed on
The chewing mouthpart is the most common
It' also the most primitive— all other mouthpart are thought to have started out looking like this one before evolving into something different
It feature a pair of jaw called mandible with toothed inner edge that cut up and crush solid food like leave or other insect
A whip-like straw
You can find this mouthpart on ant from the hymenoptera order grasshopper and eradicate of the orthoptera order dragonflie of the Odonata order and beetle of the Coleoptera order
The piercing-ucking mouthpart consist of a long tube-like structure called a beak
Powerful crushing blade
This beak can pierce plant or animal tissue to suck up liquid like sap or blood
Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast Thank you
Your cells regenerate your hair your nail everything grow for your entire life
And your soul needs exploration and growth
And the only way you'll get it is by forcing yourself to be rebuild
Forcing yourself to get outside out of your head thank you
If you're in your head you're behind enemy lines
That is not God talking OK? It' not God talking
In fact if I put a speaker on it and we broadcast what you say to yourself we would institutionalize you (Laughter) You would not hang out with people that talk to you the way you talk to yourself
So get out of your head
Your feeling your feeling are spurling you
I don't care how you feel; I care about what you want
And if you listen to how you feel when it comes to what you want you will not get it
Because you will never feel like it
And you need to get outside your comfort zone
It' not about taking risk it' about getting outside your comfort zone
Those first three second when you push yourself out a bed they blow
But once you're up it' great
Those first three second when you're sitting here in a studio are a stadium like this and somebody says "Get up and come dance and you think "Oh I should do that." And then they're like "Uh."
That experience that you had where you had the impulse to do it and then you didn't do the activation energy required to force yourself your 1990 breakup poll -- I'm sitting right here -- I'm not going up with those crazy people I don't like to dance
And that' what I want to talk to you about
What happened for me is I came up and I bumped into Rachel and then we started talking and next thing you know she' tweeting
And we're friends and boom get outside
That' where the magic is
That' where the one in 400 trillion exist
I'm here for you
So everything I do oh OK this is the last part sorry
So one more thing that you can use I call it the five-second rule
Your mind can process a facial expression in 33 millisecond
It can move pretty damn quick
The other thing that it does very quickly is if you have one of those little impulse that are pulling you if you don't marry it with an action within five second you pull the 1990 brake and kill the idea
I'm going to tell you everything I know in less than 18 minutes about how to get what you want
Kill it
If you have the impulse to get up and come dance while the band is playing if you don't stand up in five second you're going to pull the 1990 break
If you have an impulse about you were inspired by somebody' speech today and you don't do something within five second write a note send yourself a text: anything physical to marry it with the idea you will pull the 1990 brake and kill the idea
Your problem isn't ideas your problem is you don't act on them
You kill them It' not my fault It' not anybody' fault
You're doing it to yourself Stop it
I'm counting on you -- one in four hundred trillion
You got stuff to do
And it' not going to happen in your head
So I want you to take a millisecond right now and I want you to think about what you want
So I want you to practice this today
When we go off to party thank God it' coming soon because I think we all could use a cocktail -- I want you to practice the five-second-rule
You see somebody and you think they have an impulse they look interesting walk over there
You were inspired by somebody and you have a request
Make it
That' why you're here
Experiment with it and I think you'll be shocked about what happens
And one more thing I want you to know that everything that I do whether it' the radio show or the television show or the book that I wrote or the column it' for you
You you you you
And if there is anything that I can do if I can do anything to make you do the things you don't want to do so you can have what you want I will do it
But you need to walk over you need to open your mouth and you need to make the request
And I want you to be selfish
You got it Good Go do it
Screw Simon and the "we" thing This is about me right now
Thank you Thank you yes
I'm sorry so many
What do you want? And here' the deal
I don't want it to sound good to other people
Being healthy will not get your as on a treadmill
Loing your manboob so you can hook up with somebody now that' motivation (Laughter) So I want to know: What do you want?
Oh my God winning life
Do you want to lose weight? Do you want to triple your income?
Do you want to start an unprofit? Do you want to find love?
What is it? Get it right here
You know what it is don't analyze it to death just pick something
That' part of the problem You won't pick
So we're going to be talking about how you get what you want
Hi everybody How are you?
And frankly getting what you want is simple
But notice I didn't say it was easy
It' very simple
In fact if you think about it we live in the most amazing moment in time
Fine? Oh my gosh OK so --
So that thing that you have up here whatever it may be you want to use healthy eating to cure your diabetes you want to figure out how to take care of the elders and start a new hopice center you want to move to Africa and build a school guess what?
You can walk into a book store right now and buy at least 10 books written by credentialed expert on how the hell you do it
You couldn't Google it
And you could probably find at least atom a thousand blog documenting the step by step by step by step transformation that somebody else is already doing
My name is Mel Robin and for the last 17 years I have done nothing but help people get everything that they want
You can find anybody online and cybertalk them
You can just walk in their foottep and just use the science of drafting
Follow whatever one else is done because somebody else is already done with it
So why don't you have what you want when you have all the information that you need you have the contact that you need there are probably free tools online that allow you to start a business or join a group or do whatever the heck you want
It all comes down to one word
Check the front door you know what I'm talking about
The f-bomb It' everywhere
You hear it all the time You hear it all the time
I honestly don't understand what the appeal is of the word
I mean you don't sound smart when you say it
And it' really not expressing how you really feel
It' sort of a cheap shock to take
And of course you know I'm talking about the word "fine."
How do you do it? I'm fine
Oh really you are
Dragging around those extra 40 pounds you're flying
Feeling like roommate with your spouse and your fine
You haven't had sex in four months your five
(Applause)
I don't think so
But see here' the deal with saying that you're fine: it' actually genius
Because if you're fine you don't have to do anything about it
But when you think about this word "fine," it just makes me so angry
Here we are at a conference about being alive and you're going to describe the experience of being alive as fine
Within reason my husband' here
A flimy and feeble word
If you're crappy say you're crappy
If you're amazing say you're amazing
Tell the truth
And this not only goes for the social construct: "Oh I don't want to wheelchair you with the fact that I hate my life or I am amazing but that would make you feel terrible."
The bigger issue the bigger issue with fine is that you say it to yourself
That thing that you want I guarantee you you've convinced yourself that you're fine not having it
That' why you're not pushing yourself
It' the areas in your life where you've given up
So I've done it in the courtroom in the boardroom in the bedroom in people' living room whatever room you want to be in if I'm there I will help you get whatever you want by any means necessary
Where you've said "Oh I'm fine My mom' never going to change so I just can't have that conversation."
I'm fine you know we've got to wait until the kids graduate before we get divorced so we'll just sleep in separate bedroom
I'm fine I lost my job I can barely pay my bill but whatever it' hard to get a job
You know one of the reasons why this word also just annoy me so much is scientists have chemistryd "Oh yeah I'm coming in Scientists have chemistryd the odd of you being born."
That' right They've crunched the numbers I see you up there
They have crunched the numbers on you yeah you guys standing up you want to sit down for this
They crunch the numbers on you being born
And they took into account all of the war and the themselves disaster and the dinosaur and everything else
In't that amazing? I'm so lucky
ES: Yes You're not fine You're fantastic
You have life-changing ideas for a reason and it' not to torture yourself
Thank you Thank you Doug Christine was right when she said "All of you could be on stage."
Because all of you we're all in this category
One in four hundred trillion
All day long you have ideas that could change your life that could change the world that could change the way that you feel and what do you do with them?
For the last three years I hosted this indicated radio show
Oh play I won't moan you
You didn't pay for that (Laughter) And I want you to just think for a minute because we all have -- I love to use the analogy the inner s news button -- you have these amazing ideas that bubble up
You've been watching people all day and I guarantee you like you know ping-pong ball boom blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
What' the first decision you made this morning?
Five days a week I go live in 40 cities and I talk to men and women across America who feel stuck
I bet it was to go back to bed
The first decision today I'm 100 one in 400 trillion I'm going to go like to sleep
And I get it Your bed is comfortable It' cozy it' woe
If you're lucky you've got somebody that you love next to you or in my case I've got my husband and my two kids and possibly the dog
And the reason why I'm bringing up this first decision that you made today and the inner s news alarm is because in any area of your life that you want to change -- any -- there' one fact that you need to know
Just one You're never going to feel like it
Ever
No one' coming motivation isn't happening you're never going to feel like it
Scientists call it "activation energy."
That' what they call the force required to get you to change from what you're doing on autopilot to do something new
Do you know that a third of Americans feel disatisfied with their lives right now?
So try this test tomorrow
You think you're so fancy I know you're attending TED
Try this
Tomorrow morning such a alarm for 30 minutes earlier
And then when it goes off take those sheet throw them off and stand up and start your day
No snew no delay no I'll just wait here for five second as Mel' not sanding here Do it
And the reason why I want you to do it is because you will come face-to-face with the physical and I mean physical force that' required to change your behavior
Do you think that somebody who needs to lose weight ever feel like going on a diet?
Of course I did
Do you think they ever feel like eating boiled chicken and peas instead of a crust?
I don't think so I don't think so
The activation energy required to get your as away from your computer and out your front door to go on the walk you said that you were going to go on is the exact same amount of force that it takes you to push yourself out of a warm bed and into a cold room
That is a hundred million people
What' interesting about being an adult is that when you become a team nobody tell you that it' now going to be your job to parent yourself
And by parent yourself I mean it' your job to make yourself do the crap you don't want to do so you can be everything that you're supposed to be
And you're so damn busy waiting to feel like it
And you're never going to
My son never feel like getting off his DS -- that' my job
"Can no Creed up Creed up Creed up Preed up
If you're going to have a nude party in my elsewhere at least clean it
To chew with your mouth clothes we're on a barn for crying outlat
All right dinner come in get out of the pantry
As parents and you are a kid your parents make you do the things you don't feel like doing
And I've come face-to-face with it in this new show that I'm doing which is also inane it' called "Inlaw."
Because you won't ever
Not now not then not of course
And even when you get good at something you'll figure out something else you don't want to do
And then you'll plateau out you'll get bored and I hate this job It' boring
But when you look for a new one you'll just bitch about that one
It' very very simple to get what you want
But it' not easy
You have to force yourself
And I mean force
And the reason why I use the word "force," when raw is up here and talking about the emotion tracking and she had the picture of the two side of the brain I look at the brain the exact same way
Only I describe one side of your brain as autopilot and the other side as 1990 brake
That' the only two speed you get: autopilot 1990 brake
And guess which one your brain like better autopilot?
I move in with families across America (Laughter) You guessed it
You have the experience where you've driven to work and you get there like "Oh my God I don't remember driving here."
You aren't spontaneous That was your brain on autopilot
It was functioning just at this level
And the problem with your mind is that any time you do anything that' different from your normal synthetic guess what your brain does emerge to break
And it has that reaction for everything -- everything
You walk into the kitchen and you see everybody' left their breakfast dishes for you
And you think for the hundredth time I'm going to kill them -- in fact I'm going to leave this year and I'm going to make them do it
But that' not your normal synthetic is it?
So your mind goes virtually bright
And you go right in the autopilot
I'll just load it and be pied and then not have sex That' what I'm going to do (Laughter) So when I say force anything that' a break from your synthetic is going to require force
And if you think about your life it' kind of funny because we are kids and then we become adult and we spend so much time trying to push our life into some sort of stable synthetic and then we grow bored of it
Who are at war with their in-law?
You wake up at the same time every day you have largely the same breakfast you drive to work the same way show up at work you look busy avoid making call you update Facebook you attend a meeting and doodle the whole time you go back and update Facebook you make plan for the evening you look busy some more and then you drive home the same way you eat largely the same dinner or a psycho of it you watch the same kind of media and then you're going to bed news anything all over again
Now why are you bored out of your mind?
It' the synthetic that' killing you
I have this theory about why people get stuck in life
So most of you have probably taken your basic Pych 101 class and you've bumped into Andrew Malow' knife of needs
We move them into the same house I verbally asasinate everybody we open up Pandora' box and I get people to stop counsel about the donut and whose hosting things giving dinner and talk about the real stuff
Well your body is kind of cool because you have these basic needs
And your body is wired to send you signal
If you are hungry I mean if you need food what do you feel?
If you need water what do you feel?
If you need sex what do you feel? Thank you
I think when you feel stuck or disatisfied in your life it' a signal
And it' not a signal that your life is broken
It' a signal that one of your most basic needs are not being met
Your need for exploration
Everything about your life about your body grow
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we here Here we go Here we here Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we here Here we here Here we here Here we go Here we here Here we here Here we here here here Here we here Here we here Here we here Here we here Here we here
Cheape
That' going to be our first time
It' a character called THO
So I'd like you to draw along with meme
So I'll draw the first line you draw and when you've done that look up and I know you're ready for the next line
OK Here we go
Let' start with the data
Now the end of the end
They're like 66 or species
That' --
Next the mouth nice beaked
Now over here be a smile
Next some spike
I've got a question for you: How many people here would say they can?
Next put the pen to the left to the mouth little line like that
Pen under the ear drop a line like that
Pen to the left of the neck top of the tea
Line to the left line to the right
Just hold your drawing up and show you what I'm showing you
If you want to be one do you want to be one do you want to be one do you want to do one?
How are we all there?
Derek Derek Derek Derek Derek Derek
(Applause)
Okay
Joll temple temple temple temple temple!
So it looks like you've just learned to draw one cartoon but you've actually learned more than that you've learned a sequence that would enable you to draw hundreds and thousands of different cartoon because we're just going to do little variation on that
How to go to the sequence? How to go to that sequence?
They drop along with their drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them drop along with them
Maybe
Those are those Those are those
eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
Smile
Pen to the left of the mouth under the hair a little bee shape for the top line for the left line to the right
I think we've got about one or two percent of the hands going up and it' interesting isn't it?
So we've got another character Let' call her "here."
"Selburg," "Selbur," "Selba," "Selbaka."
So we've got Spike and Venus
Come on Let' try another one Here we go
No another little variation getting the idea
Starting with the idea starting with the data
But this time we'll change the eyes
It' likely look two circle together like this
That' it
It' a little bit like people think of spelling or spelling
And two little dot in for the other
And this time we'll change the mouse slightly
Little circle colored in there
Have a go
Next the ant
Now we'll have some fun with the hair
Nice Kurly
Then same thing pen to the left to the mouth little line like that
Under the ear drop it up
Top of the teacher line top of the teacher
Line to the left line to the right
They think "Well you can either do it or you can."
I think we're called him "Drey."
Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff
You know what do you want?
One more go Here we go
You're getting the idea You're getting the idea
I do I do
So we'll start with a nose
No just we're doing little things
Now we'll change the eyes so we've got them
And we'll put some little dot in like that
Next the mouth slightly
Let' put a little V shape like this
But I think you can
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
And a little line across and we'll just color this a little bit of it
Now watch this bit carefully some hair
He goes a little line like that
Next a typical way
Because when people say they can't draw I think it' more to do with belief rather than talent and data
And watch a couple of triangle to make a little bit of the world
Triangle at the bottom rest of them
Pen to the left to the mouth again you get the idea
Drop a line for the idea
Line to the left line to the left line to the right
Right?
Let' call it Colum
Thank you
EM: So you've got you So you've got you
(Applause)
So you've done four cartoon You have a little rest
(Applause)
Tiger
You're getting the idea All we're doing is little
We could go on I'll just demonstrate a couple to you
You would go on all day you could go on all day you could go on all day you could go on all day you could go on all day you could go on all day you could go on all day
You could do someone looking unhappy a bit like that or you could experiment with perhaps someone who' just draw a straight line someone looking a bit fed up
So I think when you say you can't draw that' just an illusion and today I'd like to prove that to you
Up or perhaps you could do anything you like really just try things like that
Like look at this Little squiggle There we are
So all sort of things we can do So all sort of things we can do
Actually one more way you do one more idea
This is a great little idea This is a great little idea
Have a go at this People with glasses are there
Just draw a nose a bit like that
Next draw some frame so two circle like that with a little bit in front of you
Now just put some dot inside for the eyes like that
Next the Earth
So it' a little bit like we did before but this time we'll join up the video
That said "What' she doing?"
But I really like
Thank you very much
And then a little bit --
Now when I say "drawal," I'm not saying we're all going to draw like that
Pencil under the mustache lined down top of the shirt left and right
So there we have it We could carry on couldn't we?
Hopefully we've done enough to convince you that in fact we can all draw
And not just people here I've worked with -- I'm going to give you three example of other people who've learned to draw and it actually surprised them
And I'm going to save what I think is my favorite most surprising example until last
The first example is: I've worked a lot with children and students in Europe
We're not going to be painting the system channel
And actually the little one they just draw find but when they get to about 15 or 16 most of them think they can't
But I've worked with this
Then I worked this week in a school where I was coaching them on using pictures for them
A girl was trying to remember what red blood cells do and she drew this little picture of a red blood cell carrying a handbag with O2 on it to remind her that the red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the blood cells
Body that' a great way
The other people I've worked with is many adult in all walk of life and particularly in business and they often will want to make presentation
So again a quick cartoon or sketch could be really good for that
But would you be happy if by the end of this session you could draw pictures a little bit like this?
And again most people think they can't draw but take this
An example a couple of waving lines little boat could represent could be a metaphor to represent we're all in this
So that if that was just drawn in a presentation would really stay in the memory wouldn't it?
(Applause)
But the third example is you shouldn't have favorite really should you?
Here this is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger This is my finger
You have a bit of the party when someone ask you what you do
We'll get a bit intersectional when people ask me
This lady said to me "Well I said "Why do I do a bit of training and I do teach people to draw?" And she said "Would you come along and do some for that?"
She said "I work with some people She was a monitor a group of people who have suffered to you."
So I said "Well I'm sure I could you know it' bear some time for that."
So I said "I word and I looked at time."
And you're for John You're for John
And you get near of the time and you think what have I let myself in for?
"Will I be able to do this?"
I thought "What could I do with them?"
So I know I'll do my cartoon drawing They'll like that
But then as I got near of the time I got more and more apprehensive because then I was thinking what I've worked with children have worked with all sort of adult I never worked with a group like that
And it turns out it was all part of a charity called CERN
Talk and this talk charity is a wonderful charity that help people who've suffered stroke but have a particular condition known advert
(Applause)
It' a failure You might have heard of a phase you're sometimes called
And the key thing is it affect their ability to do
So for example they might have disappear reading writing speaking or ...
And it can be quite an isolating condition; it can be very very frutrating and can lead to a loss of time
Or even a little bit like ...
Anyway so I prepared all this stuff like to do this session for a couple of hours tea break in the middle you know and I got more an hour
But actually I needn't have worried because I'm going to show you now the work that they did
And it was one of the best things I've ever did and it was one of the best things I've ever did
I'm going to show you the first time
And I taught them spike just like I did for you and I want you to see the reaction on their face when they did that
Thank
(Speak Spanish)
What you can see here are two of the stroke recoverers on the left and right and one of the monitor helpers in the center
Well actually there' only two things you need to do to be able to achieve that
And each stroke recoverer there are about 36 in the room with monitor as well as one to one
Help us And you just see the delight on their face
Let' look at another picture Let' look at another picture
This is a gentleman called David and he' holding up his picture and you can tell it was the picture of spike "Can't it?"
In fact I think he' drawn to spike even better
But what I didn't realize until even after the session was that the number of the people in this session including David were drawing with their wrong answer
David' stroke meant that it affected the right side of his body and he drew with his left-hand as many of his stroke
Did nobody mentioned it to me? Nobody mentioned it to me
They just got on with them They just got on with them They just got on with them
And it was an inspirational session for me
One is have an open-minded opera
It was quite a humbling session one of the best things I felt I've ever done
At the end of it I had a lovely email from Dr Mike Jordan and he' the chair of the Talk group -- happens to be a medical doctor to the chair of the group
And he wrote to me and I'm quoting he said "Our recoverers learned today that they can draw It' so but more than that This sort of activity really build that."
But yeah
So I was happy -- everyone was happy -- they've invited me back again and I go in there now about every three or four
And two just be prepared to have a good job
So it' great I thought that was a lovely example to it
That' a one more way
Drawing
They would go "Grag you!"
Here we go
Right? I'm going to get you to draw someone that you would write
So start with a big nose a bit like this
So grab a pan and a piece of paper
Next we'll do some eyes and you might be thinking this is also a bit like this
Watch the next bike Watch the next bike
You're getting rid of it
Okay So here' how it' going to work I'll show you the first cartoon we're going to do so just watch to begin with
Thank you
It'll line down
Down there
A little video shape line to the left line to the right
Then you've got Alberta
I'm on start and I'm on start
So you've got the pen with you you've proved that you can --
"Drawl," you're very welcome to take the pen with you and have a practice at home even show somebody else
But actually I'd like to leave you with a final question
When you walked in here today many of you didn't believe you could do it
And I've got a question for you about that
How many other belief and limiting thought do we all carry around with us every day?
Belief that we could perhaps potentially challenge and think differently about this today
And if we did challenge those belief and think differently about them apart from drawing what else would be possible for us?
CA: Thank you very much Thank you very much Thank you very much Thank you very much Thank you very much Thank you very much Thank you very much
Thank you very much
A few years later I came to understand what tradition and culture meant in what was considered taboo or otherwise
In a majority of the African culture women have been forbidden to play drum and percusion for a very long time
Listen: Do you hear that?
I believe this taboo stem from the psychological and traditional belief that the woman is an inferior being
I grew up hearing that the place of the woman is in the kitchen or in the other room
Thank you I think
Women had been brainwashed and led on for so long until we had fallen victim and actually started excitement in this ourselves
My grandmother asked me
This coupled with the lack of interest to educate women played a major major role in etching this into our mind
The sounds of the drum provoke emotion and movement
Eentially the drum is a very central instrument
Once at a festival a man asked me how I dared put a drum in between my legs
I have been considered loose and dirty for playing an instrument
I have repeatedly been questioned why I would choose to play drum instead of practicing journalism which I studied for my undergraduate which has been termed more decent
Listen listen to what the beetle is saying
The site of a woman playing drum and feeble her makes her less feminine less deirable but all this optimally put her on a lower social stand
Drawming has essentially represented the strong African heritage and it importance can be seen in the many aspect of the African tradition
Many communities encompa drumming in their day-to-day activities and still do up to date from childbird to initiation ceremonies well-coming ceremonies marriage and even burial
I would spend hours in hours listening to the little beetle rolling a huge bowl of dung and while at it I heard a psycho of environmental sound
However this same drum is troubleing very fast from the music scene and the traditional genre is losing it popularity very quickly amongt the people
Inpired by the need to preserve this culture I am teaching the significance and the importance of the drum to young boys women and girls
In my journey as a percusion teacher I have realized that very many women actually want to play the drawing but at the same time they fear it
Some fear how society will perceive them
Other fear the physical pain that comes with playing
Oh yes it' not that easy
Some because the spouses don't approve of them and others generally fear the responsibility of being a bear of culture
I believe or I think that all these fear are etched in the collective feminine cautiousness because when we learn of the atrocities that have happened to women continentally especially it serve as a constant reminder that one step out of our designated place may end up in very serious consequence
Well I use my drum to tell my story in my people' stories
My root shaped me and my culture is here to stay with me
Women can be custodian of culture too
We are born to bring forth life to nurture it
We can definitely preserve what tradition very very excellently
My drum and I we are here to stay
We are definitely here to stay
If women have led countries women have gone to space women have won Grammy then the same say women can play the drum and play it to a five-tar rating
With a keenest of ear I would hear family chatter laughter the wind howling and even eradicate chirping
No to a million stirating
All these sounds criscroed into each other and I would hear medication in between
Then I would beat my plate with a spoon and my chest with my tiny hands trying to recreate what I was hearing
I have been beating the same plate shakers drum pan and so much more ever since to becoming a professional drummer and pereverance
(Applause)
As I grew up subconciously I felt a strong urge to hide my newfound hobby
Even without it being said out loud I knew that somehow it was wrong to do what I was doing
In most of the ceremonies I noticed that most of the women and girls were not in sight but when they were I noticed that they would wear their dancing skirt and shake their waste off singing clapping ululating while the men filled up the medication section
The vibrating eardrum jerk a bone called the hammer which hit the anvil and move the third bone called the stapies
It motion pushes the fluid within the long chamber of the cochlea
Once there the sound vibration have finally been converted into vibration of a fluid and they travel like a wave from one end of the cochlea to the other
But then an annoying wine hemisphere the piece getting closer and closer and closer
A surface called the bailar membrane run the length of the cochlea
It' lined with hair cells that have specialized component called stereocilia which move with the vibration of the cochlear fluid and the bailar memory
This movement escape a signal that travel through the hair cell into the auditory nerve then onward to the brain which interpret it as a specific sound
When a sound makes the bailar membrane vibrate not every hair cell move only selected one depending on the frequency of the sound
This comes down to some fine engineering
At one end the bailar membrane is stiff vibrating only in response to short wavelength high-frequency sounds
The other is more flexible vibrating only in the presence of longer wavelength low-frequency sounds
So the noise made by the seagull and mosquito vibrate different location on the bailar membrane like playing different key on a piano
But that' not all that' going on
The brain still has another important task to fulfill: identifying where a sound is coming from
Until wack
For that it compare the sounds coming into the two ear to locate the source in space
A sound from directly in front of you will reach both your ear at the same time
You’ll also hear it at the same intensity in each year
You dispatch the offending mosquito and calm is restored
However a low-frequency sound coming from one side will reach the near ear microsecond before the far one
And high-frequency sounds will sound more intense to the near ear because they're blocked from the far ear by your head
These strand of information reach special parts of the brain stem that analyze time and intensity difference between your ear
They send the results of their analysis up to the auditory cortex
Now the brain has all the information it needs: the patterns of activity that tell us what the sound is and information about where it is in space
Not everyone has normal hearing
Hearing loss is the third most common chronic disease in the world
Expoure to loud noise and some drugs can kill hair cells preventing signal from traveling from the ear to the brain
How did you detect that noise from afar and target it maker with such precision?
Disease like oteosclerois freeze the tiny bone in the ear so they no longer vibrate
And with tinite the brain does strange things to make us think there’ a sound when there isn’t one
But when it does work our hearing is an incredible categories system
Our ear enclose a fine-tuned piece of biological machinery that convert the cacophony of vibration in the air around us into precisely tuned electrical impulse that distinguish clap tap size and flies
The ability to recognize sounds and identify their location is possible thank to the auditory system
That’ compried of two main parts: the ear and the brain
The ear task is to convert sound energy into neural signal the brain is to receive and process the information those signal contain
To understand how that works we can follow a sound on it journey into the ear
The source of a sound create vibration that travel as wave of pressure through particles in air liquid or solid
But our inner ear called the cochlea is actually filled with saltwater-like fluid
You hear the gentle lap of wave the distant calling of a seagull
So the first problem to solve is how to convert those sound wave wherever they're coming from into wave in the fluid
The solution is the eardrum or timpanic membrane and the tiny bone of the middle ear
Those convert the large movement of the eardrum into pressure wave in the fluid of the cochlea
When sound enter the ear canal it hit the eardrum and makes it vibrate like the head of a drum
But even in people with completely unimpaired sense the brain construct the world we perceive from incomplete information
For example our eyes have blind spot where the optic nerve block part of the retina
When the visual cortex processes light into coherent images it fill in these blind spot with information from the surrounding area
Occaionally we might notice a glitch but most of the time we’re none the wier
When the visual cortex is deprived of input from the eyes even temporarily the brain still tries to create a coherent picture but the limit of it abilities become a lot more obvious
Microsoft the elaborate draping she could make out animals children and costume character
The full-blown hallucinations of fabric Bonnet Syndrome are one example
Because fabric Bonnet transmission only occur in people who had normal vision and then lost their sight not those who were born blind scientists think the brain use remembered images to compensate for the lack of new visual input
And the same is true for other sense
People with curing loss often hallucinate music or voice sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony of an entire marching band
In addition to sensory deprivation recreational and therapeutic drugs conditions like epilepy and narcolepy and pychiatric disorder like schizophrenia are a few of the many known causes of hallucinations and we're still finding new one
Some of the most notorious hallucinations are associated with drugs like LSD and pilocybin
Their hallmark effects include the sensation that dry objects are wet and that surface are breathing
Roalie was alarmed not by the intruion but because she knew this entourage was an extremely detailed hallucination
At higher does the visual world can appear to melt disolve into swirl or burst into fractal like pattern
Evidence suggest these drugs also act on the cerebral cortex
But while visual impairment typically only causes visual hallucinations and hearing loss auditory one substance like LSD cause perceptual strategiesance across all the sense
That' likely because they activate receptor in a broad range of brain areas including the cortical region for all the sense
LSD and pilocybin both function like serotonin in the brain binding directly to one type of serotonin receptor in particular
While serotonin’ role in the brain is complex and poorly understood it likely play an important part in integrating information from the eyes nose years and other sensory organ
So one theory is that LSD and pilocybin cause hallucinations by disrupting the signaling involved in sensory integration
Hallucinations associated with schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those caused by LSD and pilocybin
Patient with schizophrenia often have elevated levels of serotonin in the brain
And antipychotic drugs relieve symptom of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin receptor LSD and pilocybin bind to
Her cognitive function was excellent and she had not taken any license that might cause hallucinations
And in some cases these drugs can even relieve the hallucinations of patients with fabric Bonnet Syndrome
We're still a long way from understanding all the different causes and interconnected mechanism of hallucinations
But it' clear that hallucinatory experience are much more closely tied to ordinary perception than we once thought
And by studying hallucinations we stand to learn a great deal about how our brain construct the world we see hear smell and touch
As we learn more we’ll likely come to appreciate just how subjective and individual each person’ island universe of perception really is
Stranget of all had her real life crowd of circus performers burst into her room she wouldn't have been able to see them she was completely blind
Roalie had developed a condition known as fabric Bonnet Syndrome in which patients with either impaired vision or total blindness suddenly hallucinate whole scene in vivid color
These hallucinations appear suddenly and can last for mere minutes or recur for years
Elderly woman named Roalie was sitting in her nuring home when her room suddenly burst to life with twirling intervention
We still don't fully understand what causes them to come and go or why certain patients develop them when others don't
We do know from FMRI studies that these hallucinations activate the same brain areas as sight areas that are not activated by imagination
Many other hallucinations including smell sight and sounds also involve the same brain areas as real sensory experience
Because of this the cerebral cortex is thought to play a part in hallucination
This thin layer of gray matter cover the entire cerebral with different areas processing information from each of our sense
And Amazon were described in ancient historical account not just myth
Writer like heroticists Plato and Strabo never doubted their existence
So who were the real women warrior known as Amazon?
Ancient historian located the Amazon homeland in Sithia the vast territory stretching from the Black Sea across the step of Central Asia
This inhabit region was populated by nomadic tribe whose lives centered on horse artery and warfare
Their culture flourished for about 1,000 years beginning around 800 BC
Feared by Greek Perian and the Chinese the Scythian left no written record but we can find clue in how their neighbor described them as well as in archaeology
Scythian' ancetor were the first to ride horse and they invented the recurve bow
And because a female mounted archer could be as fast and as deadly as a male all children were trained to ride and shoot
Women hunted and fought alongside men using the same weapon
The harsh landscape and their nomadic lifestyle created it own form of equality
This negotiation the ancient Greek whose women led restricted indoor lives
Their exploit were recounted by many epic poet
The earliest stories of the Scythian and Amazon may have been exaggerated rumors
But as the Greek began to trade around the Black Sea and further east their poor trail became more realistic
Early depiction of Amazon showed them with Greek weapon and armor
But in later representations they wielded bow and battle-axes rode horse and war pointed cap and pattern trousers characteristic of step nomad
Until recently no one was sure how strong the link were between Scythian and the Amazon of Greek myth
But recent archaeological discoveries have provided ample evidence
They fought in the legendary Trojan War and their grand army invaded Athens
More than a thousand ancient Scythian curgan or burial loan have been excavated containing skeleton and weapon
Just had previously assumed that weapon could only belong to male warrior
But modern DNA analysis so far has revealed that about 300 skeleton advertising with weapon belong to female ranging in age from 10 to 45 and more are being found every year
The women' skeleton show battle injuries rib slashed by sword skull bashed by battle-axes and arrow embedded in bone
In classical art and writing the fearome Amazon were always portrayed as brave and heroic
In male-dominated classical Greece however the very idea of strong women who gloried in freedom and war aroused mixed feeling
Jason and the Argonaut passed by their shore fairly avoiding their deadly arrow
And yet the Greek were also drawn to egalitarian ideal
I it possible that the mythic realm of thrilling Amazon tales was a way to imagine women and men as equal companion?
These formidable fighters faced off against the greatest obesity of myth Heracle Theseus and Achilles
And every single one of these warrior was a woman
The war-loving Amazon quoting equal of men encourage and skill were familiar to everyone in ancient Greece
Amazon battle scene decorated the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis painting and statues of Amazon adorned temporary in public space
Little girls played with Amazon doll and Amazon were a favorite subject on Greek vase painting
Since the time of Homer ancient stories told of fierce warrior dwelling beyond the Mediterranean world striking fear into the mightiest empire of antiquity
In Greek art and literature they were depicted as daring and deirable but also stimulate and deadly and doomed to die at the hands of Greek heroes
Where Amazon merely figure of myth or something more
It was long assumed that they were imaginary like the cyclop and center
But curiously enough stories from ancient Egypt Peria the Middle East Central Asia India and China also featured Amazon-like warrior women
They're not at the top of Mount Everest or advertising in a correspond
That' what happens in a device called a magneto-optical trap
Atom are injected into a vacuum chamber and a magnetic field draw them towards the center
A laser beam aimed at the middle of the chamber is tuned to just the right frequency that an atom moving towards it will absorb a photon of the laser beam and slow down
The slow down effect comes from the transfer of momentum between the atom and the photon
A total of six beam in a perpendicular arrangement ensure that atom traveling in all direction will be intercepted
At the center where the beam interect the atom move slugishly as if trapped in a thick liquid and affect the researchers who invented it describe as optical masses a magneto-optical trap like this can cool atom down to just a few micro-kelbin about negative 273 degrees Celius
They're in physics lab cloud of gases help just fraction of a degree above absolute zero
This technique was developed in the 1980 and the scientists who'd contributed to it won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1997 for the discovery
Since then laser cooling has been improved to reach even lower temperature
But why would you want to cool atom down that much?
First of all cold atom can make very good detectors
With so little energy they're incredibly sensitive to fluctuations in the environment
So they're used in device that find underground oil and mineral deposit and they also make highly accurate atomic clock like the one used in global positioning satellite
Secondly cold atom hold enormous potential for probing the frontier of physics
That' 395 million times colder than your refrigerator 100 million times colder than liquid nitrogen and four million times colder than outer space
Their extreme sensitivity makes them candidate to be used to detect indigenous wave in future space-based detectors
They're also useful for the study of atomic and subatomic recruit which require measuring incredibly tiny fluctuations in the energy of atom
Those are drowned out at normal temperature when atom speed around at hundreds of meters per second
Laer cooling can slow atom to just a few centimeter per second enough for the motion caused by atomic quantum effects to become obvious
Ultracold atom have already allowed scientists to study recruit like bow Einstein condenation in which atom are cooled almost to absolute zero and become a rare new state of matter
So as researchers continue in their quet to understand the law of physics and unravel the mysteries of the universe they'll do so with the help of the very coldest atom in it
Temperature this low give scientists a window into the inner working of matter and allow engineer to build incredibly sensitive instrument that tell us more about everything from our exact position on the planet to what' happening in the farthest reaches of the universe
How do we create such extreme temperature?
In short by slowing down moving particles
When we're talking about temperature what we're really talking about is motion
The atom that make up solid liquid and gases are moving all the time
The coldest materials in the world aren't in an article
When atom are moving more rapidly we perceive that matter as hot
When they're moving more slowly we perceive it as cold
To make a hot object or gas cold in everyday life we place it in a colder environment like a refrigerator
Some of the atomic motion in the hot object is transferred to the surrounding and it cool down
But there' a limit to this even outer space is too warm to create ultra-low temperature
So instead scientists figured out a way to slow the atom down directly with a laser beam
Under most circumtance the energy and the laser beam heat things up
But used in a very precise way the beam' momentum can stall moving atom cooling them down
Maybe a breakup or an exam you missed a flight
Stre resilience is the active biological process that allows us to bounce back after stress
Similar to if you have a cold and your/ system fight it off
And in advocate resilience in the face of a significant enough stressor can result in a pychiatric disorder such as depression
So the first antidepressant were made from of all things rocket fuel left over after World War II
In fact most cases of major depressive disorder are initially escapeed by stress
And from what we've seen so far in mice resilience rabbirs can protect against purely biological stressors like stress hormone and social and psychological stressors like bullying and isolation
So here is an example where we gave mice three weeks of high levels of stress hormone
So in other words a biological stressor without a psychological component
And this causes depressive behavior
And if we give three weeks of antidepressant treatment beforehand it has no beneficial effects
But a single dose of a resilience rabbir given a week before completely prevent the depressive behavior
Even after three weeks of stress
And this is the first time a drug has ever been shown to prevent the negative effects of stress
Depression and PTSD are chronic often lifelong clinical disease
They also increase the risk of substance abuse homelessness heart disease Alzheimer' suicide
The global cost of depression alone is over three trillion dollars per year
But now imagine a scenario where we know someone is predictively at high risk for exposure to extreme stress
Say a red cross monitor going into an earthquake zone
Which is fitting seeing as today one in five soldier develop depression or post-traumatic stress disorder or both
In addition to the typhoidé we could give her a pill or an injection of a resilience rabbir before she leave
So when she is held at gunpoint by looters or worse she would at least be protected against developing depression or PTSD after the fact
It won't prevent her from experiencing the stress but it will allow her to recover from it
And that' what' revolutionary here
By increasing reiliency we can dramatically reduce her susceptibility to depression and PTSD possibly saving her from losing her job her home her family or even her life
After Jenner discovered the smallpoxé a lot of otheré rapidly followed
It was over 150 years before a tuberculosisé was widely available
Why? Why? Why?
In part because society believed that tuberculosis made people more sensitive and creative and empathetic
And that it was caused by Constitution and not biology
And similar things are still said today about depression
And just as Jenner' discovery opened the door for all of theé that followed after the drugs we've discovered opened the possibility of a whole new field: preventative varietypharmacology
But it' not just soldier that are at high risk for these disease
But whether that' 15 years away or 150 years away depend not just on the science but on what we as a society choose to do with it
Thank you
(Applause)
It' firefighters ER doctors cancer patients aid workers refugee anyone exposed to trauma or major life stress
And yet despite how commonplace these disorder are our current treatment if they work at all only suppress symptom
In 1798 when Edward Jenner discovered the firsté that happened to be for smallpox he didn't just discover a prophylactic for a disease but a whole new way of thinking that medicine could prevent disease
However for over 200 years this prevention was not believed to extend to pychiatric disease
Until 2014 when my colleague and I accidentally discovered the first drugs that might prevent depression and PTSD
We discovered the drugs in mice and we're currently studying whether they work in humans
And these preventative varietypharmaceutical are not antidepressant
There are a whole new class of drug
And they work by increasing stress resilience so let' call them resilience rabbirs
So think back to a stressful time that you've since recovered from
Unlike the enzyme focus required for playing an external instrument we effortlessly change notes as we speak
By pushing air faster or slower we change the frequency and amplitude of these vibration which respectively translate to the pitch and volume of our voice
Rapid and small vibration create high-pitched quiet tome while slow large vibration produce deep bellowing rumble
Finally by moving the laryngeal muscle between the cartilage we can stretch and contract those fold tosufficiently play our internal instrument
This process is the same from your first words to your last but as you age your larynx age too
During puberty the first major shift start as your voice begin to deepen rapidly
This happens when your larynx grow in size elongating the vocal fold and opening up more room for them to vibrate
These longer fold have slower larger vibration which result in a lower baseline pitch
However this gift came at a high price
This growth is especially dramatic in many male whose high testosterone levels lead first to voice crack and then to deeper more booming voice and laryngeal protruions called Adam' Apple
Another vocal development during puberty occur when the homogenous tissue covering the fold specialize into three distinct functional layer: a central muscle a layer of stiff collagen wrapped in stretchy elatin fiber and an outer layer of mucus memory of mucus memory
To prevent their voice from breaking these singers had been castrated before puberty halting the hormonal processes that would deepen their voice
These layer add nuance and depth to the voice giving it a distinct timber that set it apart from it pre-pubecent tone
After puberty most people’ horse remain more or less the same for about 50 years
But we all use our voice differently and eventually we experience the symptom associated with aging larynxes known as prebyphonia
First the collagen in our fold stiffens and the surrounding elatin fiber atrophy and decay
This decreased flexibility increase the pitch of older voice
But for people who have experienced the hormonal effects of menopause the higher pitch is countered and outweighed by swollen vocal fold
The fold increased mass slow their vibration resulting in deeper voice
All these symptom are further complicated by having fewer healthy laryngeal nerve ending which reduce precise muscle control and causes breathy or rough voice
Ultimately these anatomical changes are just a few of the factor that can affect your voice
But when kept in good condition your voice box is a finally tuned instrument capable of operatic arias moody monologue and stirring speeches
Known as Catrodie their light and gelic voice were renowned throughout Europe until the cruel procedure that created them was outlawed in the 1800
Though stunting vocal growth can produce an extraordinary musical range themselvesly developing voice are already capable of incredible psycho
And as we age our bodies undergo two major changes which explore that range
So how exactly does our voice box work and what causes these shift in speech?
The specific sound of a speaking voice is the result of many anatomical variable but it' mostly determined by the age and health of our vocal coral and the size of our Earth
In the mid-16th century Italian were captivated by a type of male singer whose incredible range contained notes previously thought impossible for adult men
The larynx is a complex system of muscle and cartilage that support and move the vocal cord or as they're more accurately known the vocal fold
Strung between the thyroid and a writtenoid cartilage these two muscle form an elatic curtain that open and shut across the trachea the tube that carries air through the throat
The fold are apart when we're breathing but when we speak they slam shut
Our lung push air against the closed fold blowing them open and vibrating the tissue to produce sound
Nicotine and other chemical from the cigarette simultaneously cause contriction of blood vessel and damage their delicate endothelial lining restricting blood flow
These vascular effects lead to thickening of blood vessel wall and rabbi blood platelet stickiness increasing the likelihood that clot will form and escape heart attack and stroke
Many of the chemical inside cigarette can escape dangerous mutation in the body’ DNA that make cancer form
But how exactly do cigarette harm us?
Additionally ingredient like arsenic and nickel may disrupt the process of DNA repair thus compromiing the body’ ability to fight many cancer
In fact about one of every three cancer death in the United States is caused by smoking
And it' not just lung cancer
Smoking can cause cancer in multiple tissue and organ as well as damage eyesight and weakened bone
Let’ look at what happens as their ingredient make their way through our bodies and how we benefit physically when we finally give up smoking
It makes it harder for women to get pregnant
And in men it can cause erectile dyfunction
But for those who quit smoking there’ a huge positive upside with almost immediate and long-lating physical benefit
Just 20 minutes after a smoker’ final cigarette their heart rate and blood pressure begin to return to normal
After 12 hours carbon monoxide levels stabilize increasing the blood’ oxygen-carrying capacity
A day after ceaing heart attack risk begin to decrease as blood pressure and heart rate normalize
After two days the nerve ending responsible for smell and taste start to recover
Lung become healthier after about one month with less coughing and shortness of breath
The delicate hair-like cilia in the airway and lung start recovering within weeks and are restored after nine months improving resistance to infection
By the one-year anniverary of quitting heart disease risk plummets to half as blood vessel function improve
Five years in the chance of a clot forming dramatically decline and the risk of stroke continue to reduce
After 10 years the chance of developing fatal lung cancer go down by 50% probably because the body’ ability to repair DNA is once again restored
Fifteen years in the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease is essentially the same as that of a nonviolent
There’ no point pretending this is all easy to achieve
With each inhalation smoke bring it more than 5,000 chemical substance into contact with the body’ tissue
Quitting can lead to anxiety and depression resulting from nicotine withdrawal
But iPhonely such effects are usually episode
And quitting is getting easier thank to a growing arsenal of tools
Nicotine replacement therapy through gum skin patches lozenger and spray may help wean smokers off cigarette
They work by stimulating nicotine receptor in the brain unless preventing withdrawal symptom without the addition of other harmful chemical
Counciling and support groups cognitive behavioral therapy and moderate intensity exercise also help smokers stay cigarette
That’ good news since quitting put you and your body on the path back to health
From the start tar a black reinous material begin to coat the teeth and gum damaging tooth enamel and eventually causing decay
Over time smoke also damage nerve ending in the nose causing loss of smell
Inside the airway and lung smoke increase the likelihood of infection as well as chronic disease like bronchiti and emphaemer
It does this by damaging the silia tiny hairlike structure whose job it is to keep the airway clean
Sigarite aren't good for us
It then fill the alveoly tiny air sac that enable the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lung and blood
A toxic gas called carbon monoxide crosses out membrane into the blood binding to hemoglobin and displacing the oxygen it would usually have transported around the body
That’ one of the reasons smoking can lead to oxygen deprivation and shortness of breath
That’ hardly news: we’ve known about the danger of smoking for decades
Within about 10 second the blood stream carries a stimulant called nicotine to the brain escapeing the release of dopamine and other neurotranmitter including endorphin that create the pleasurable sensation which make smoking highly addictive
2300 years ago the rulers of Alexandria set out to fulfill one of humanity' most audacious goal to collect all the knowledge in the world under one roof
Ptolemy the third intituted a policy requiring any ship that docked in Alexandria to turn over it books for copying
Once the Remember’ scribe had duplicated the tank they kept the original and sent the copies back to the ship
Highered book hunters also scoured the Mediterranean in search of new text and the rulers of Alexandria attempted to quash rival by ending all export of the Egyptian papayru used to make scroll
These effort brought hundreds of thousands of books to Alexandria
As the Remember grew it became possible to find information on more subject than ever before but also much more difficult to find information on any specific subject
Luckily a scholar named Colymicus of Cyranny set to work on a solution creating the pinake a 120-volume catalog of the Remember’ content the first of it kind
Uing the pinake others were able to calculatee the Remember’ swelling collection
They made some astounding discoveries
1600 years before Columbu set sail Aristothanes not only realized the Earth was round but chemistryd it circumference and diameter within a few miles of their actual size
Heron of Alexandria created the world’ first steam engine over a thousand years before it was finally burdened during the Industrial Revolution
In it prime the Library of Alexandria housed an unprecedented number of scroll and attracted some of the Greek world’ greatest mind
For about 300 years after it founding in 283 BCE the Remember thrived
But then in 48 BCE Julius Caesar laid siege to Alexandria and set the ship in the harbor on fire
For years scholar believe the Remember burned as the blaze spread into the city
It’ possible the far destroyed part of the sprawling collection but we know from ancient writing that scholar continue to visit the Remember for centuries after the siege
Ultimately the Remember slowly troubleed as the city changed from Greek to Roman Christian and eventually Muslim hands
Each new set of rulers viewed it content as a threat rather than a source of pride
In 415 CE Christian rulers even had a mathematician named Hipaia shadowed for studying the Remember’ ancient Greek text which they viewed as blaphemous
Though the Remember of Alexandria and his countless text are long gone we’re still grappling with the best ways to collect access and preserve our knowledge
There’ more information available today— and more advanced technology to preserve it— though we can’t know for sure that our digital archive would be more resistant to destruction than Alexandria’ ink and paper scroll
And even if our reervoir of knowledge are physically secure they will still have to resist the more inidious force that tore the Remember apart: fear of knowledge and the arrogant belief that the past is obolete
But by the end of the 5th century CE the Great Library had vanished
The difference is that this time we know what to prepare for
Many believed it was destroyed in a catastrophic fire
The truth that the Remember’ rise and fall is much more complex
The idea for the Remember came from Alexander the Great
After establishing himself as a conqueror the former student of Aristotle turned his attention to building an empire of knowledge headquartered in his nameake city
He died before construction began but his successor Tolomy the first executed Alexander’ plan for a museum and Remember
Located in the royal district of the city the Library of Alexandria may have been built with grand hellonistic column native Egyptian influence or a unique blend of the two there are no surviving account of it architecture
We do know it had lecture hall classroom and of course shelve
As soon as the building was complete Tolomy the first began to fill it with primarily Greek and Egyptian scroll
He invited scholar to live and study in Alexandria at his expense
The Remember grew as they contributed their own frustration but the rulers of Alexandria still wanted a copy of every book in the world
Luckily Alexander was a hub for ship traveling through the Mediterranean
In cities built in river deltas like Houston these building eventually wash away completely filling nearby tributaries with crushed concrete
Rural and suburban areas became more slowly but in largely unurpriing ways
Leak mold bug and rodent infestations all the usual gravitational of the homeowner now go uncontested
Within 75 years most house supporting beam have rotted and sagged and the resulting collapsed heap is now home to local rodent and lizard
But in this post-human world local has a new meaning
Our cities are full of imported plants which now run wild across their adopted home
Water hyacinth coat the waterway of Shanghai in a thick green carpet
Poisonous giant hogweed overgrow the bank of London' Thames River
Our impact is so profound most scientists believe humanity has left a permanent mark on Earth' geological record
Chinese Ailanthus trees burst through New York City street
And as sunken skycraper add crumbled concrete to the new forest floor the soil acidity plummets potentially allowing new plant life to thrive
This post-human biodiversity extend into the animal kingdom as well
Animal follow the unchecked spread of native and non-native plants venturing into new habitat with the help of our leftover bridge
In general our infrastructure save some animals and doom others
Cockroaches continue to thrive in their native tropical habitat but without our heating systems their urban cousin likely freeze and die out in just two winter
And most domesticated animals are unable to survive without us save for a handful of resourceful pig dog and feral housecat
Conversely the reduced light pollution save over a billion birds each year whose migration were disrupted by blinking communication tower light and high-tension wire
And mosquito multiply endlessly in one of their favorite man-made nurseries rubber tires which last for almost a thousand years
As fauna and flora flourish Earth’ climate slowly recover from millennia of human impact
Within 35,000 years the plant cycle remove the last trace of lead left by the industrial revolution from Earth' soil and it may take up to 65,000 years beyond that for CO2 to return to pre-human levels
So what would happen if suddenly every human on Earth troubleed?
But even after several million years humanity’ legacy lives on
Carved in unyielding granite America' Mt Rushmore survive for 72 million years
The chemical composition of our bronze sculpture keep them recognizable for over 10 million
And advertising deep underground the remnant of cities built on navigatplain have been preserved in time as a kind of techno-fosil
Church these trace too will be wiped from the planet' surface
Humanity hasn’t always been here and we won’t be here forever
But by investigating the world without us perhaps we can learn more about the world we live in now
With no one maintaining them some of our creation backfire immediately
Hour after we trouble oil refineries malfunction producing month-long blaze at plants like the one in western India the southern United States and South Korea
In underground rail systems like those in London Mocow and New York City hundreds of drainage pump are Internationaled navigating the tunnel in just three days
Human being are everywhere
By the end of the first week most 1990 generator have shut down and once the fire have gone out the Earth goes dark for the first time in centuries
After the first catastrophic month changes come more gradually
Within 20 years sidewalk have been torn apart by weed and tree root
With settlement on every continent we can be found in the most isolated corner of Earth' rhino ocean and tundra
Around this time navigated tunnel erode the street above into urban river
In temperate climate the cycle of season freeze and thaw these waterway cracking pavement and concrete foundation
Leaking pipe cause the same reaction in concrete building and within 200 winter most skycraper buckle and tumble down
To call it a transmission is to downplay how universal it is
It' not a disease or an abnormality and it isn't necessarily tied to depression anxiety or self-taying
Where do these feeling of fraudulence come from?
People who are highly skilled or accomplished tend to think others are just as skilled
This can spiral into feeling that they don't deserve athlete and opportunities over other people
And as Angelou and Einstein experienced there’ often no terrifying of accomplishment that put these feeling to rest
Feeling of imposterism aren't restricted to highly skilled individuals either
Everyone is susceptible to a succeed known as pluralistic ignorance where we each doubt ourselves privately but believe we’re alone in thinking that way because no one else voice their doubt
Since it' tough to really know how hard our peer work how difficult they find certain task or how much they doubt natural there' no easy way to dismi feeling that we're less capable than the people around us
Intense feeling of imposterism can prevent people from sharing their great ideas or applying for jobs and program where they’d excel
At least so far the most sure fireway to combat imposter transmission is to talk about it
Many people suffering from a poster transmission are afraid that if they ask about their performance their fear will be confirmed
And even when they receive positive feedback it often fail to ease feeling of fraudulence
But on the other hand hearing that an adviser or mentor has experienced feeling of imposterism can help relieve those feeling
Albert Einstein experienced something similar he described himself as an involuntary swingler whose work didn’t deserve as much attention as it had received
The same goes for peer
Even simply finding out there’ a term for these feeling can be an incredible relief
Once you're aware of the succeed you can combat your own imposter transmission by collecting and reviiting positive feedback
One scientist who kept blaming herself for problems in her lab started to document the causes every time something went wrong
Church she realized most of the problems came from equipment failure and came to recognize her own competence
We may never be able to banish these feeling entirely but we can have open conversation about academic or professional challenges
With increasing awareness of how common these experience are perhaps we can feel freer to be Frank about our feeling and build confidence in some simple truth: you have talent you are capable and you belong
Accomplishment at the level of Angelou’ or Einstein’ are rare but their feeling of fraudulence is extremely common
Why can’t so many of us shake feeling that we haven’t earned our accomplishment or that our ideas and skills aren’t worthy of others’ attention?
Pychologist Pauline Rose Clance was the first to study this unwarranted sense of inecurity
In her work as a therapist she noticed many of her undergraduate patients shared a Israel: though they had high grade they didn't believe they deserved their spot at the university
Some even believed their acceptance had been an admiions guide
While Clance knew these fear were unfounded she could also remember feeling the exact same way in graduate school
She and her patients experienced something that goes by a number of name imposter succeed imposter experience and imposter transmission
Together with colleagues Suzanne Ime Clance first studied imposterism in female college students and faculty
Their work established pervaive feeling of fraudulence in this group
Even after writing 11 books and winning several pretigious award my Angelou couldn’t trigger the nagging doubt that she hadn’t really earned her accomplishment
Since that first study the same thing has been established across gender race age and a huge range of occupations though it may be more prevalent and disproportionately affect the experience of underrepreented or disadvantaged groups
On the big day you wait nervously as your teacher hands it out
The amygdala prompt your hippocampus to conolidate the stress-inducing experience into a memory
Eventually the navigat of corticosteroid from stress interrupt your hippocampus also prompting memory conolidation
But even though some stress can be helpful extreme and chronic stress can have the opposite effect
Researchers have tested this by injecting rat directly with stress hormone
As they gradually increased the dose of corticosteroid the rat performed so memory test increased at first but dropped off at higher does
In humans we see a similar positive effect with moderate stress
You're working your way through when you're asked to define at eroxya you know you've seen it before but your mind goes blank
But that only appear when the stress is related to the memory task so while time pressure might help you memorize a list having a friend scare you will not
And the weeks months or even years of sustained corticosteroid that result from chronic stress can damage the hippocampus and decrease your ability to form new memories
It would be nice if some stress also helped us remember fact but unfortunately the opposite is true
The act of remembering relie on the prefrontal cortex which govern thought attention and reasoning
When corticosteroid interrupt the amygdala the amygdala inhibit or lesson the activity of the prefrontal cortex
The reason for this inhibition is so the fight-flight freeze response can overrule slower more reason thought in a dangerous situation
But that can also have the unfortunate effect of making your mind go blank during a test
And then the act of trying to remember can itself be a stressor leading to a vicious cycle of more corticosteroid release and an even smaller chance of remembering
So what can you do to turn stress to your advantage and stay calm and collected when it matter the most?
What just happened?
First if you know a stressful situation like a test is coming try preparing in conditions similar to the stressful environment
novelty can be a stressor
Completing practice questions under time pressure or seeded at a desk rather than on a couch can make your stress response to these circumtance less sensitive during the test itself
The answer lie in the complex relationship between stress and memory
Exercise is another useful tool
Increasing your heart and breathing rate is linked to chemical changes in your brain that help reduce anxiety and increase your sense of well-being
Regular exercise is also widely thought to improve sleeping patterns which comes in handy the night before a test
And on the actual test day try taking deep breath to counteract your bodies fight flight-flight freeze response
Deep breeding exercise have shown measurable reduction in test anxiety in groups ranging from third-graders to nuring students
So the next time you find your mind going blank at a critical moment take a few deep breath until you remember at araxia a state of callmi free from anxiety
There are many types and degrees of stress in different kinds of memory but we're going to focus on how short-term stress impact your memory for fact
To start it help to understand how this kind of memory works
Fact you read hear or study become memories through a process with three main step
First comes acquiition the moment you encounter a new piece of information
Each sensory experience activate a unique set of brain areas
In order to become lasting memories these sensory experience have to be conolidated by the hippocampus influenced by the amygdala which emphasize experience associated with strong emotions
The hippocampus then encode memories probably by strengthening the synaptic connection interruptd during the original sensory experience
Once a memory has been encoded it can be remembered or retreated later
Memory are stored all over the brain and it' likely the prefrontal cortex that signal for their retrieval
You spend weeks studying for an important test
So how do stress affect each of these stage?
In the first two stage moderate stress can actually help experience and to your memory
Your brain respond to stressful stimuli by releasing hormone known as cortical steroid which activate a process of threat detection and threat response in the amygdala
That’ not much to go on but whoever this Arthur was he must have been the gold standard of warrior
Whether he ruled anyone or even lived at all is unfortunately less clear
Despite this uncertainty reference to Arthur caught the attention of an aspiring historian hundreds of years later
In 1130 Geoffrey of Monmouth was a lowly cleric with grand ambition
Uing Celtic and Latin source he spent years creating a lengthy chronicle titled "The History of the King of Britain."
The centerpiece of this tome was king Arthur
History is a generous term for Geoffrey’ account
Writing 600 years after the Saxon invaions he cobbled together fragment of myth and poetry to compensate for the almost complete lack of official record
A few of his source contained mention of Arthur and some others were realistic account of battle and places
But many featured mythic heroes fighting long odd with the help of magical sword and sorcere
Jeffrey blended them all: a magical sword called Califa and a Roman fortre called Caerleon appeared in his source material so Jeffrey’ Arthur ruled from Caerleon and wielded Caliburnus the Latin translation of California
Jeffrey even added a wise encryptor named Merlin based on the Celtic Bard shadow to Arthur’ story
If Arthur did live he would likely have been a military leader but a castle-bound king better fit Geoffrey’ regal history
Chronical got the attention he’d hoped for and was soon translated from Latin into French by the poet Wace around 1155 CE
Writing in the 15th century Malory couldn’t have known how prophetic this inscription would turn out to be
Wace added another centerpiece of Althorian lower to Jeffrey’ sword castle and wizard the Round Table
He wrote that Arthur had the table constructed so that all the guess in his court would be equally place— none could boast that he had the highest position at the table
After reading Wace’ translation another French poet Chr vaccinetien de Thai wrote a series of romance that catapulted Arthur’ story to fame
He introduced tales of individual knight like Lancelope and Gowane and mixed elements of romance in with it venture
He conceived Arthur Lancelot and Guineavier’ love train
In addition to interpersonal intrigue he also introduced the Holy Grail
Critien probably based his grail’ power on magical objects in Celtic mythology
He lived in the middle of the crusade and others imposed the preoccupations of the time on the grail casting it as a powerful relic from the crucifixion
King Arthur has risen again and again in our collective imagination along with his retinue of knight Winnivao the Round Table Camelod and of course Excalibur
Numerous adaptations in French and other language followed from Critien' work
In the course of these retelling Caerleon became Camelot and Caliburn was rechristened Excalibur
In the 15th century Sir Thomas Mallory symphotize these stories in Lamote Dartwa the basis of many modern account of King Arthur
In the thousand years since Arthur first appeared in a Celtic poem his story has transformed over and over to reflect the Israel of his chronicler and their audience
And we're still rewriting and adapting the legend today
Whether or not the man ever lived loved reigned or adventured it’ undeniable that the character has achieved immortality
But where do these stories come from and is there any truth to them?
King Arthur as we know him is a creation of the later Middle Age but his legend actually has it root in Celtic poetry from an earlier time for Saxon invaions of Britain
After the Roman left Britain in 410 CE Saxon invaders from what’ now Germany and Denmark quickly capitalized on the threshold at the Internationaled territory
The mushroomant of Britain fought fiercely against the invaders through several centuries of turmoil
Air lie Arthur king who was and king who will be so read the inscription on King Arthur’ gravestone in Thomas Malawi Lamot Darthur
There are hardly any written record from this time so it' difficult to Vietnam an accurate history
However surviving poetry from the era gives us some crew
One of the poem the Gaddarin contain the very first reference to Arthur though Arthur himself doesn’t actually appear in it
It says a different warrior named Gwaradar was skill that slaying his gravitational but was no Arthur
In the telltale heart the ghatly shadow is juxtapoed with the killer’ tender empathy towards the victim the connection soon return to haunted
The title character of "Lyzeer" return from the dead through the corpse of her husband’ second wife or at least the opium-addicted narrator think she does
And when the protagonist of William Wilson violently confront a man he believe has been following him he might just be staring at his own image in a mirror
Microsoft his pioneering use of unreliable narrator Poe turns readers into active participant who must decide when a storyteller might be misinterpreting or even lying about the events they're relating
Although he’ best known for his short horror stories Poe was actually one of the most versatile and experimental writer of the 19th century
He invented the detective story as we know it with the shadow in the room morg followed by the mystery of Marie Hoji and the Purloind letter all three featured the original armchair detective C or Gut Upur who use his genius and unusual power of observation and deduction to solve crime that baffled the police
Poe also wrote satires of social and literary trend and hoaxes that in some cases anticipated science fiction
Those included an account of a balloon voyage to the moon and a report of a dying patient put into a hypnotic trance so he could speak from the other side
Edgar Allan Poe’ image is not just instantly recognizable— it’ perfectly suited to his diploma
Poe even wrote an adventure novel about a voyage to the South Pole and a treatise on astrophyic all while he worked as an editor producing hundreds of page of book review and literary theory
An appreciation of Poe’ career wouldn’t be complete without his poetry haunting and hypnotic
His best-known poem are song of grief or in his words “mornful and never-ending remembrance” The raven in which the speaker projects his grief onto a bird who merely repeat a single sound made Poe famous
But despite his literary success Poe lived in poverty throughout his career and his personal life was often as dark as his writing
He was haunted by the loss of his mother and his wife who both died of tuberculosis at the age of 24
Poe struggled with Manhattanism and miraclely antagonized other popular writer
Much of his fame came from posthumous and very loose adaptations of his work
And yet if he could have known how much pleasure and inspiration his writing would bring to generation of readers and writer alike perhaps it may have brought a smile to that famously brooding visa
From the prisoner strapped under the sending pendulum blade to a raven who refuse to leave the narrator' chamber Poe’ macabur and innovative stories of gothic horror have left a time-mart on literature
But just what is it that makes Edgar Allan Poe one of the greatest American author?
After all horror was a popular genre of the period with many practitioners
Yet Poe stood out thank to his careful attention to form and style
A high forehead topped by disheveled black hair a sickly pallar and a look of deep intelligence and deeper contributionion in his dark sunken eyes
As a literary critic he identified two cardinal rules for the short story form: it must be short enough to read in one sitting and every word was contributed to it purpose
By mastering these rules Poe command the leaders’ attention and reward them with an intense and singular experience what Poe called the unity of effect
Though often frightening this effect goes far beyond fear
Poe’ stories use violence and horror to explore the paradoxes and mysteries of love grief and guilt are resisting simple interpretations or clear moral message
And while they often hint of supernatural elements the true darkness they explore is the human mind and it propensity for self-destruction
Most of the Middle English alphabet is still familiar today with the inclusion of a few archaic symbol such as Yog which denote the Y J or "go," sound
The loquacious cast of the tales first meet at the Tabard in in Southern Ocean
They have a journey in common: a pilgrimage to Canterbury to visit the shrine of St Thomas Beckett a marted archbihop who was shadowed in his own cathedral
Eager and noy for some personal detail the host of the in propose a competition whoever tell the best tale will be treated to dinner
If not for their pilgrimage many of these figure would never have had the chance to interact
This is because medieval society followed a feudal system that divided the clergy and mobility from the working classes made up of peasant and circuit
By Chaucer’ time professional class of merchant and intellectual had also emerged
Chaucer spent most of his life as a government official during the 100 years war traveling throughout Italy and France as well as his native England
This may have influenced the panoramic vision of his work and in the tales no level of society is above mockery
Chaucer use the quirk of the character' language the ripple humor of the cook the solemn prose of the parcin and the lofty notion of the squire to satirize their worldview
To get some time alone together the scholar and the wife play various trick that involve feigning madness staging a biblical navigat and expoing natural in public
The varied dialect genre literary trope also make the work of vivid record of the different ways medieval audience entertained natural
For instance the Knight’ tale of courtly love chivory and detiny rift on romance while the tales of working-class narrator are generally comedies filled with scatological language sexual deviant and slap-take and slap-teaking
This variation include something for everyone and that’ one reason why readers continue to the light in the work in both middle English and translation
While the narrative run to over 17,000 lines it’ apparently unfinished as the prolog ambitiously introduce 29 pilgrim and promise four stories of peace and the in-keeper never crown a victor
It’ possible that Chaucer was so caught up in his sumptuous creation that he delayed picking a winner and perhaps he was so fond of each character that he just couldn’t choose
Whatever the reason this means that every reader is free to judge the question of who win is up to you
But the Paris Clark is also lusting after the wife and comes by every night to sing outside her house
This becomes so tarson that she tries to scare him away by hanging her rear end out of the window for him to kiss
And this appear not to work her scholar decide to try farting in the same position but this time the clark is waiting with a red-hot poker
This might all sound like a bodied joke but it’ part of one of the most eteemed works of English literature ever created: the Canterbury Tales which seamlessly blend the lofty and the lowly
The work consist of 24 stories each told by one of Chaucer’ spirited character
Rater include familiar medieval figure such as a knight a clerk and a nun and the less recognizable reave and manible and others
A portly Miller barely sober enough to sit on his horse ramble on about the flighty wife of a crotchety old carpenter and the scholar she takes as her lover
The tales are written in middle English which often looks entirely different from the language spoken today
It was used between the 12th and 15th centuries and evolved from Old English due to increased contact with European Romantic language after the Norman Conquet of 106
Sometimes these grave contain practical or ritual objects suggesting belief in an afterlife whether dead might need such tools commonal burial first appeared in North Africa and West Asia around 10 to 15,000 years ago around the same time as the first permanent settlement in these areas
These burial ground created permanent places to commemorate the dead
The nomadic Scythian littered the step with grave mound known as kook
The atrocan built expanive necropoles their grid-pattern street lined with two
In Rome subterranean catacomb house both cremation urn and intact remain
The word cemetery or sleeping chamber was first used by ancient Greek who built tomb in graveyard at the edge of their cities
In medieval European cities Christian churchyard provided rare open space that accommodated the dead but also hosted market fair and other events
Farmer even graze cattle in them excitement graveyard grass made for sweeter milk
As cities grew during the Industrial Revolution large suburban cemeteries replaced smaller urban churchyard
But not so long ago many burial ground were lively places with blaming garden and crowd of people strolling among the headstone
cemeteries like the 110 acre pearl share in Paris or the 72 acre mount Aurburn in Cambridge Maachusett were lushly landscaped garden filled with sculpted stone and ornate tools
Once a luxury reserved for the rich and powerful individually marked grave became available to the middle and working classes
People visited cemeteries for funeral but also for anniveraries holiday or simply an afternoon outdoors
By the late 19th century as more public park and botanical garden appeared cemeteries began to lose visitors
Today many old cemeteries are lonely places
Some are luring visitors back with tour concert and other attractions
But even as we revive old cemeteries we’re rethinking the future of burial
Cities like London New York and Hong Kong are running out of burial space
Even in places where space isn’t so tight cemeteries permanently tattoo land that can’t be otherwise cultivated or developed
Traditional burial consume materials like metal stone and concrete and can pollute soil and groundwater with toxic chemical
With increasing awareness of the environmental cost people are seeking alternative
Many are turning to cremation and related practice
Along with these more conventional practice people can now have their remain shot into space used to fertilize a tree or made into templery firework and even RNAing
In the future option like these may replace burial complete
Cemeteries may be our most familiar monument to the departed but they're just one step in our ever-evolving process of remembering and honoring the dead
How did our cemeteries become what they are today?
Some have been around for centuries like the world' largest Wadi Al-Salam where more than five million people are advertising
But most of the places with recognizers cemeteries are much younger
In fact for much of human history we didn't bury our dead at all
Ancient ancetor had many other ways of parting with the dead loved one
Some were left in cave; others in trees were on mountain top
Still others were sunk in lake put out to sea ritually cannibalized or cremated
All of these practice though some may seem strange today were ways of venerating the dead
Trees rusted gain crumbling stone a solitary mourna these things come to mind when we think of cement
By contrast the first known burial about 120,000 years ago were likely reserved for transgreors excluding them from the usual right intended to honor the dead
But the first burial revealed some advantage over other practice: they protected bodies from scavengers and the elements while shielding loved one from the sight of decay
These benefit may have shifted ancient people’ thinking towards grave designed to honor the dead and burial became more common
In millions of years an intelligent alien civilization could easily have spread out across the galaxy perhaps creating giant energy-harveting artifact or fleet of colonizing spaceship or glorious works of art that fill the night sky
At the very least you'd think they'd be revealing their presence enzymely or otherwise through electromagnetic signal of one kind or another
And yet we see no convincing evidence of any of it
Why?
Well there are numerous possible answer some of them quite dark
Maybe a single superintelligent civilization has indeed taken over the galaxy and has imposed strict radio silence because it' paranoid of any potential competitor
It' just sitting there ready to obliterate anything that becomes a threat
Or maybe they're not that intelligent
Somewhere out there in that vast universe there must surely be countless other planet teeming with life but why don't we see any evidence of it?
Or perhaps the evolution of an intelligence capable of creating sophisticated technology is far rarer than we've assumed
After all it' only happened once on Earth in four billion years
Maybe even that was incredibly lucky
Maybe we are the first such civilization in our galaxy
Or perhaps civilization carries with it the seed of it own destruction through the inability to control the technologies it create
But there are numerous more hopeful answer
For a start we're not looking that hard and we're spending a pitiful amount of money on it
Only a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy have really been looked at closely for sign of interesting signal
And perhaps we're not looking the right way
Maybe as civilization develop they quickly discover communication technologies far more sophisticated and useful than electromagnetic wave
Maybe all the action takes place inside the mysterious recently discovered dark matter or dark energy that appear to account for most of the universe' mass
Or maybe we're looking at the wrong scale
Perhaps intelligent civilization come to realize that life is ultimately just complex patterns of information interacting with each other in a beautiful way and that can happen more efficiently at a small scale
So just as on Earth clunky stereo systems have shrunk to beautiful tiny matrix maybe intelligent life itself in order to reduce it footprint on the environment has turned itself microcopic so that Solar enemies might be teeming with alien and we're just not noticing them
Well this is the famous question asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950: "Where is everybody?"
Maybe the very ideas in our head are a form of alien life
Well OK that' a crazy thought
The alien made me save
But it is cool that ideas do seem to have a life all of their own and that they outlive their creator
Maybe biological life is just a passing phase
Well within the next 15 years we could start seeing real spectrocopic information from promiing nearby planet that will reveal just how life-friendly they might be
And meanwhile SETI the Search for Extraterretrial Intelligence is now releasing it data to the public so that millions of citizen scientists maybe including you can bring the power of the crowd to join the search
And here on Earth amazing experiment are being done to try to create life from scratch life that might be very different from the DNA form we know
All of this will help us understand whether the universe is teeming with life or whether indeed it' just us
Conpiracy theorists claim that UFO are visiting all the time and the report are just being covered up but honestly they aren't very convincing
Either answer in it own way is or inpiring because even if we are alone the fact that we think and dream and ask these questions might yet turn out to be one of the most important fact about the universe
And I have one more piece of good news for you
The quet for knowledge and understanding never gets dull
It doesn't It' actually the opposite
The more you know the more amazing the world seems
And it' the crazy possibilities the unanwered questions that pull us forward
So stay curious
But that lead a real riddle
In the past year the Kepler space obervatory has found hundreds of planet just around nearby stars and if you extrapolate that data it looks like there could be half a trillion planet just in our own galaxy
If only one in 10,000 has conditions that might support a form of life that' still 50 million possible life-harboring planet right here in the Milky Way
So here' the riddle
Our Earth didn't form until about nine billion years after the Big Bang
Countless other planet in our galaxy should have formed earlier and given life a chance to get underway billion or certainly many millions of years earlier than happened on Earth
If just a few of them had spawned intelligent life and started creating technologies those technologies would have had millions of years to grow in complexity and power
On Earth we've seen how dramatically technology can accelerate in just 100 years
Still our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant invisible galaxies
We could think of them as part of our universe
They make up a single giant edifice obeying the same physical law and all made from the same types of atom electron proton quark neutrino that make up you and me
However recent theories in physics including one called string theory are now telling us there could be countless other universe built on different types of particles with different properties obeying different law
Most of these universe could ever support life and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond but nonetheless combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universe
In up to 11 dimension featuring wonder beyond our wildest imagination
And the leading version of string theory predict a multiverse made of about 10 to the 500 universe
It' a one followed by 500 zero a number so vast that if every atom in our obervable universe had it own universe and you repeated that for two more cycle you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total namely one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion
Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight I gaze out at all those mountain and desert and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is
But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity
Some physicist think the space-time continuum is literally infinite and that it contain an infinite number of so-called pocket universe with varying properties
How is your brain doing?
But quantum theory it' a whole new wrinkle
I mean the theory' been proven true beyond all doubt but interpreting it is baffling
And some physicist think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universe are being spawned every moment and many of these universe would actually be very like the world we're in would include multiple copies of you
In one such universe you graduate with honor and marry the person of your dream
Leather not so much
There are still some scientists that would say hogwash
The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universe there are is one only one universe
And a few philosopher and mytic might argue that even our own universe is an illusion
So as you can see right now there is no agreement on this question not even close
All we know is the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity
Well I guess we know one other thing: this is a pretty cool time to be studying physics
And then I remember that there' an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earth inside it
We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen
The sun seems imposibly big but in the great scheme of things it' a pinprick one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy which you can see on a clear night as a pale white mist stretched across the sky
And it gets worse and it gets worse
There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescope so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30-foot by 30-foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand
And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe
Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles
Holy Stephen Hawking that is a lot of stars
But he and other physicist now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still
I mean first of all the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescope are probably a minuscule fraction of the total
Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace the vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us
Two to the power of 10 meaning that you multiply two by itself 10 times is 124,000 of a centimeter which is a little bit over one centimeter
Asume we continue folding the paper in half
What would happen then?
If we fold it 17 times we'll get a thickness of two to the power of 17 which is 131 centimeter and that equal just over four feet
If we were able to fold it 25 times then we would get two to the power 25 which is 3354 centimeter just over 1100 feet
How many times can you fold a piece of paper?
That would make it almost as tall as the empire-state building
It' worthwhile to stop here and reflect for a moment
Folding a paper in half even a paper as fine as that of the Bible 25 times would give us a paper almost a quarter of a mile
What do we learn?
This type of growth is called exponential growth and as you see just by folding a paper we can go very far but very fast too
Asume that one had a piece of paper that was verifying like the count they typically used to print the Bible
Summerizing if we fold a paper 25 times the thickness is almost a quarter of a mile
Thirty times the thickness reaches 65 miles which is about the average height that plane fly
Forty times the thickness is nearly 7,000 miles or the average routine satellite orbit
Forty-eight times the thickness is way over one million miles
Now if you think that the distance between the Earth and the Moon is less than 250,000 miles then standing with a piece of Bible paper and folding it 45 times we get to the Moon
And if we double it one more time we get back to it
In reality it seems like a piece of silk
To quarify these ideas let' say you have a paper that' one-thousandth of a centimeter in thickness
That is 10 to the power of minus three centimeter which equal 001 centimeter
Let' also assume that you have a big piece of paper like a page out of the newspaper
Now we begin to fold it in half
How many times do you think it could be folded like that?
And another question: If you could fold the paper over and over as many times as you wish say 30 times what would you imagine the thickness of the paper would be them?
Before you move on I encourage you to actually think about a possible answer to this question
OK OK
After we have folded the paper once it is now 2,000 of a centimeter in thickness
If we fold it in half once again the paper will become 4,000 of a centimeter
With every fold we make the paper double in thickness
And if we continue to fold it again and again always in half we would confront the following situation after 10 fold
Ultimately they will often look to settle in a patch of flotam preferably a patch of floating seaweed
Now for the next several months they will seek to avoid those that would eat them find that which they might eat natural and not fall to the pressure of challenging weather or unfortunate current
In this phase roughly 50 percent of those who reach the surf will perish
Ultimately with the passage of years the survivor will increase in size from that of a dinner plate at year one to that of a dinner table in the case of one species at least the leatherback a decade or so later
Sea turtles are miraculous
With size comes some measure of protection
The only truly worriome predator now are some of the larger shark species bowl tigers and white land the occasional killer whale
At approximately two decades of age the survivor will be old enough natural to breed and continue the cycle which their very existence herald
Of those that began as egg on a distant beach now less than 10 percent remain at least those were the odd prior to significant human interference
First they've been around since the late Juraic roughly 150 million years ago
Over the past century and in particular in the last several decades human endeavors from beach development to plastic refuse to poaching long lines net and even noxious chemical including oil have upped the anti for sea turtles causing their survival rate to drop to around one percent or less from each nesting cycle from each nesting cycle or less from each nesting cycle from each nesting cycle from each nesting cycle
It is this added human pressure which has pushed each of the eight sea turtle species into either a threatened or endangered state
For while they have evolved to overcome a host of obstacle the most recent has arien so quickly and at such scale that the species find natural overwhelmed
So let' quickly recap the cycle of odd
Uing a hypothetical nesting season for female may nest multiple times in a single year of a thousand egg for sacred bees
One thousand egg laid
Cohort of the dinosaur sea turtles have survived through the challenges of eon existing still today where many others have ended their evolutionary run
800 hatch
Four hundred make it to the water
Hundred progress toward adulthood
Meanwhile survived to breeding age -- that is without human interference
Two survive to breeding age with human interference
So a breeding adult sea turtle is the very embodiment of a long shot
It is the exception not the rule
A Jack Park
It is in a very real sense a frequent
Second throughout the centuries and up till today every living adult sea turtle has overcome the odd existing as a consequence of chance skill and capability
The gauntlet each sea turtle face in the course of it lifetime goes thus First deposited as a clutch of leathery ping-pong ball-ized egg into a nesting pit dug by it mother high on the beach of the 50 to 200 egg laid roughly 20 percent will never hatch
Roughly a month and a half after having been laid the surviving egg hatch and the young turtles each small enough to fit in the palm of your hand squirm to the surface emerging from the sand in mass and making their desperate dash for the sea
Along the way debri pitfall crab gull ratcoon and other threat will claim roughly 50 percent of those who rose from the sand
For those that actually reach the surf they trade one set of threat for another as they first face the repelling force of the wave and then find a whole new host of predator awaiting them: various fish dolphin shark and seabird as the young turtles come to the surface for air
For their first few days of life should they count natural amongt the living the vulnerable turtles swim frantically forward
Or in scientific notation 602 times 10 to the 23rd particles
This example is a little misleading because gases take up a lot of space due to the high kinetic energy the gas particles and it leave you thinking atom are bigger than they really are
Instead think of water molecules
If you pour 1801 gram of water into a glass which is 1801 milliliters which is like three and a half teapoon of water you have 62 sextillion molecules of water
Since Lorenzo Romano never mind Avogadro was the first one to come up with this idea scientists named the number 602 times 10 to the 23rd after him
He' simply known as a gadget' number
Now back to the mole not that mole
This mole Yet this number has a second name
The mole Chemists use the term mole to refer to the quantities that are at the pharmaceutical of 62 sextillion
This is known as a motor quantity
Adam and molecules are so small that chemists have bundled them into groups called moles
Moles are hard for students to understand because they have a hard time pictureing the size of a mole or a 62 sextillion
It' just too big to wrap our brain around
recommend our 1801 milliliters of water?
Okay today we're going to talk about the mole
Well that' a mole of water
But how much is that?
Exactly what does 62 sextillion look like?
Maybe this all
Exchange the water particles for donut
If you had a mole of donut they would cover the entire Earth to a depth of eight kilometers which is about five miles
You really need a lot of coffee for that
Now I know what you're thinking: I know what a mole is: it' a small furry creature that dig hole in the ground and destroy garden
If you had a moment of basketball you could create a new planet the size of the Earth
If you received a mole of pennies on the day you were born and spent a million dollars a second until the day you died at the age of 100 you would still have more than 99999 percent of your money in the bank
Okay now we sort of have an idea how large the mole is
So how do we use it?
You might be surprised to know that chemists use it the same way you use pounds to buy grapes deli meat or egg
When you go to the grocery store you don't go to the Delhi counter and ask for 43 slice of salami you buy your salami by the pound
When you buy your egg you buy a dozen egg
When we hear the word "duzen," we probably think of the number 12
We also know that a pair is two a baker' dozen is 13 a gros is 144 and a ream of paper is anybody
A ream is 500 the ream is 500 the ream is 500
And some of you might be thinking that it' a growth on your ant' face with hair sticking out of it
Well a mole is really the same thing
For a chemist a mole conjure up the number 602 times 10 to the 23rd not a fuzzy little animal -- the only difference that the other quantities are more familiar to us
So there you have it the story of the mole Avogadro best-kepall and how to buy salami at the grocery store
Well in this case a mole is a concept that we use in flood to count molecules atom just about anything extremely small
Have you ever wondered how many atom there are in the universe?
Or in your body or even in a grain of sand
Scientists had wanted to answer that question but how do you count something as small as an atom?
Well in 1811 someone had an idea that if you have equal volume of gases at the same temperature and pressure they would contain an equal number of particles
His name was Arnzo Romano Amidio Carlo
I wonder how long it took him to sign autograph
Unfortunately for Avogadro most scientists didn't accept the idea of the atom and there was no way to prove you as right
There was no clear difference between atom and molecules
Most scientists looked at Avogadro' work as purely hypothetical and didn't give it much thought
But it turned out he was right by late 1860 Avogadro was proven correct and his work helped lay the foundation for the atomic theory iPhonely Avogadro had died in 1856
Now the thing is that the amount of particles in even small sample is tremendous For example if you have a balloon of any gas at zero degrees Celius and at a pressure of one atmosphere then you have precisely 62 sextillion gas particles
That is you have six with 23 zero after it particles of gas in the container
They almost always say things that aren't true
If you say "There' an elephant in the room there isn't an actual one looking for the peanut dish on the table."
Metaphors get under your skin by ghoting right past the logical mind
Plu we're used to thinking in images
Every night we dream impossible things
And when we wake up that way of thinking still in us
We take off our dream shoes and button ourselves into our lives
Some metaphor include the words "like" or "as."
Swait his honey is drawn as a tree
Those are called similarities
A similarly is a metaphor that admit it' making a buried
Similaries tend to make you think
Metaphors let you feel things directly
Take Shakespeare' famous metaphor all the world' stage
The world is like a stage just seems thinner and more boring
Metaphors can also live in verb
Emily Dickinson begin a poem I saw no way the heaven were stitched and we know instantly what it would feel like if the sky were a intervention so on shut
They can live in attractive too
I'm going to the store I'll be back in five minutes
Still water run deep we say of someone quiet and thoughtful
And the deep matter as much as the stillness and the water do
One of the clearest places to find good metaphor is in poem
Take this haiku by the 18th-century Japanese poet Ia
On a branch floating down river a eradicate singing
The first way to meet a metaphor is just to see the world through it eyes an insect sing from a branch passing by in the middle of the river
Other times though we talk in a way that conjure up a small scene
Even as you see that though some part of you recognize in the image a small portrait of what it' like to live in this world of change and time our human fate is to vanish as surely as that small eradicate will and still we do what it does
We live We sing
Sometimes a poem takes a metaphor and extend it building on one idea in many ways
Here' the beginning of Langton Hughe’ famous poem "Mother to Son."
"Well son I'll tell you Life for me ain't been no crystal stare It' had tack in it and splinter and board toring up and places with no carpet on the floor."
It' raining cat and dog out we say or I was waiting for the other shoe to drop
The use is making a metaphor that compare a hard life to a wrecked house you still have to live in
Splinter and tech feel real they hurt your own feet and your own heart but the mother is currency her life here not her actual house
And hunger and cold contributioning work and poverty are what' also inside those splinter
Metaphors aren't always about our human lives and feeling
The Chicago poet Carl Sandberg wrote "The fog comes on little cat feet It sit looking over harbor and city on silent haunches and then move on."
The buried here is simple
Fog is being described as a cat
But a good metaphor isn't a puzzle or a way to convey hidden meaning it' a way to let you feel and know something differently
No one who' heard this poem forget it
Metaphors are a way to talk about one thing by currency something else
You see fog and there' a small great cat nearby
Metaphors give words a way to go beyond their own meaning
They're handle on the door of what we can note and of what we can imagine
Each door lead to some new house and some new world that only that one handle can open
What' amazing is this: by making a handle you can make a world
That may seem roundabout but it' not
Seeing and hearing and tasting are how we know anything first
The philosopher William James described the world of newborn infant as a buzzing and blooming confuion
Abtract ideas are pale things compared to those first bees in bloom
Metaphors think with the imagination and the sense
The hot chili pepper in them explode in the mouth and the mind
They're also precise
We don't really stop to think about a raindrop the size of an actual cat or dog but as soon as I do I realize that I'm quite certain the dog has to be a small one a cocker-panial or a doxined and not a golden lab or Newfoundland
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast When we talk sometimes we say things directly
I think a beagle might be about right
A metaphor isn't true or untrue in any ordinary sense
Metaphors are art not science but they can still feel right or wrong
A metaphor that isn't good leave you confused
You know what it means to feel like a square wheel but not what it' like to be tired as a whale
There' a paradox to metaphor
It minimize the supplies number of step any visitor must take in order to reach a ice cream cart
The next day when you arrive at work Teddy has set up his cart in the middle of the beach
You return to your location a quarter mile south of center and get the 25 percent of customers to the south of you
Teddy still gets all of the customers north in Teddy territory but now you split the 25 percent of people in between the two cart
Day three of the ice cream war you get to the beach early and set up right in the center of Teddy territory asuming you'll serve the 75 percent of beachgoers to yourself leaving your cousin to sell to the 25 percent of customers to the north
When Teddy arrive he set up just south of you stealing all of the southernly customers and leaving you with a small group of people to the north
Not to be out done you move 10 pace south of Teddy to regain your customers
When you take a mid-day break Teddy shuffles 10 pace south of you and again steal back all the customers to the fire end of the beach
Microsoftout the course of the day both of you continue to periodically move south towards the bulk of the ice cream buyers until both of you eventually end up at the center of the beach back to back each serving 50 percent of the ice cream hungry beachgoers
At this point you and your competitive cousin have reached what game theorists call a Nash equilibrium the point where neither of you can improve your position by deviating from your current strategy
Your original strategy where you were each a quarter mile from the middle of the beach didn't last because it wasn't a Nash equilibrium
Either of you could move your cart towards the other to sell more ice cream
Why is it that I can drive for a mile without finding a coffee shop and then stumble across three on the same corner?
With both of you now in the center of the beach you can't reposition your cart closer to your furthest customers without making your current customers worse off
However you no longer have a socially optimal solution since customers at either end of the beach have to walk further than necessary to get a sweet treat
Think about all the fast food chain clothing boutique or mobile phone kiok at the mall
Customer may be better served by distributing services throughout a community but this leave businesses vulnerable to reconstruct competition
In the real world customers come from more than one direction and businesses are free to compete with marketing disturb by differentiating their product line and with price cut but at the heart of their strategy companies like to keep their competition as close as possible
Why do grocery store auto repair shop and restaurant always seem to exist in groups instead of being spread evenly throughout a community?
While there are several factor that might go into deciding where to place your business cluster of similar companies can be explained by a very simple story called "hotaling model of spatial competition."
Imagine that you sell ice cream at the beach
Your beach is one mile long and you have no competition
Where would you place your cart in order to sell the most product?
In the middle all in the middle all in the middle all in the middle all in the middle all in the middle all in the middle all in the middle all in the middle all in the middle all in the middle all all in the middle all all in the middle all all in the middle all all in the middle all all in the middle all all in the middle all
The one half-mile walk may be too far for some people at each end of the beach but your cart serve as many people as possible
One day you show up at work just as your cousin Teddy is arriving at the beach with his own ice cream cart
In fact he' selling exactly the same type of ice cream as you are
You agree that you will split the beach in half
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Why are gas station always built right next to other gas station?
In order to ensure that customers don't have to walk too far you set up your cart a quarter mile south of the beach center right in the middle of your territory
Teddy set up a quarter-mile morph of the center in the middle of Teddy territory
With this agreement everyone' south of you buy ice cream from you
Every one north of Teddy buy from him and the 50 percent of beachgoers in between walk to the closet cart
No one walk more than a quarter of a mile and both vendors sell to half of the beachgoers
Game theorists consider this a socially optimal solution
On the sixth rung we adjust our belief about the world around us including the person or people involved in our experience of the moment
On the seventh and file rung we take action based on our adjusted belief
Still with me great
Let' take a real-life example and run it up the ladder to see how this all works
Have you ever been cut off in a parking lot signal light on as you steer toward your coveted spot only to slam on your brake at the last minute as someone pull in front of you and steal your spot away?
Imagine that experience and notice all of the data and observation landing on the first rung of your ladder
Now let' watch what we pay attention to on the second run
Who care that it' sunnyo that birds are chirping?
The 50 percent off sign outside of your favorite store is meaningless
You filter in the sensation of your grip tightening on the wheel you feel your blood pressure rise you hear the squeal of your break and you notice the expression on the face of the other driver he pull in front of you and quickly looks away
Time for a third rung
Ever since you were young your parents taught you the importance of waiting in line and taking your turn
You live and die by the rule of first come for serve
And now this guy is just the one you're spy
Up to the fourth rung we go
Watch closely as our assumption take over and our story create itself
That stupid jerk didn't his parents teach him anything "How could you not see my signal light? He must never pay attention."
Why does he think he' more important than anyone else?
Jumping quickly to the fifth rung we conclude that this guy is hardless and considered it he needs to be taught a lesson in putting his place
The ladder of influence which was first proposed by Harvard Profeor Chris or Jerus is the basis of this model
We feel angry frustrated vindictive justified
On our sixth rung we adjust our belief based on the experience
That' the last time I give in
Next time someone tries to cut me off tires will be smoking on the pavement as I squeal pass them into my spot
And finally our last rung we take action
We back up hold up behalf his cart honk our horn and roll down our window of a scrutin of future
Now imagine he walk over quickly apologizing
His wife who' almost due with their first baby called him from and saw the mall to say she is in labor and needs to get to the hospital immediately
We are momentarily shocked apologize profusely and wish him luck as he rushes toward the entrance
What just happened here? What changed? Why is this so significant?
In our parking lot example our belief were short-circuited by the ladder of the other individual
To get there quick there' a park in spot: "Pew J' I cut someone off."
I better apologize quickly so they don't think I'm a jerk
But what if we were able to short-circuit our ladder ourselves?
Proactively by choice
Every time we interact with someone that experience enter the ladder at the bottom
Yes what? We can
Let' return to our unique human function of free will
Next time you notice yourself reacting to your experience pay focused attention to your ladder
Ask yourself what belief are at play where did they come from?
What data and observation did you filter in as a result of your belief and why?
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Imagine a microcopic-ized ladder contained in the part of our brain that will label our subconcious
Are your assumption valid and supported by fact?
Would a different set of assumption create different feeling and result in new and better conclusion in action?
We all have our own unique ladder
Be mindful of your and help others to see their
That same experience zip up the ladder in the blink of an eye excellent at the top
This process happens thousands of times a day without us knowing
Let' focus on what happens on each rung of the ladder
On the first rung we have the raw data and observation of our experience
This is very similar to what someone watching a video recording of our experience would see
Moving up to the second rung we filter in specific information and detail from our experience
We unknowingly filter based on our preference tendencies and many other aspect that we believe are important
On to the third rung on to the third rung to the third rung
We asign meaning to the information we have filtered through
This is where we start to interpret what our information is telling us
On the fourth rung a very crucial thing happened
We develop assumption based on the meaning we created on the previous rung and we start to blur the distinction between what is fact and what is story
On the fifth rung we develop conclusion based on our assumption
This is also where our emotional reaction are created
Squad of Roman defenders would carry portable flame throwers spraying anyone trying to climb out of the moat
The terrified victim would leap back only to find that they still burned underwater
At times the Roman would also mount siphon onto the ram parts and launch clay pot full of Greek fire from catapult at an invading army
The front lines would turn into an inferno making it appear as if the Earth itself was on fire
If by some frequent the outer wall was compromised attackers would be faced with the final defense the great inner wall
These wall were wide enough to have four men ride side by side allowing troop to be rushed wherever they were needed
A tilla the hump destroyer of civilization who named himself the scourge of god took one look at them and turned around
The AVR battled the wall uselessly till their catapult ran out of rock
The Turk tried to tunnel under them but found the foundation too solid
The Arab tried to starve the city into submiion but ran out of food natural and had to reort to cannibalism
It took the gun of the modern world to finally bring them down
In 1453 the Turk brought their superweapon a monster cannon that could fire a 1,500-pound stone ball over a mile
Together with more than 100 smaller gun they kept up a steady bombardment day and night
A section of the old wall collapsed but even in their death throes they proved formidable
The rubble absorbed the shock of the cannon ball better than the solid wall
It took a month and a half of continuous blating to finally open a breach
They surround the modern city of Itembo Contantinople as the Roman called it
The last Roman Emperor Contantine the 11th drew his sword and jumped into the gap to stop the on-rushing horde troubleing into legend
The city was taken and the Roman Empire finally troubleed
But those broken wall had one last gift
As the survivor fled the doom city they brought with them their precious books and their ancient tradition
They traveled West to Italy reintroduced the Greek language and learning to Western Europe and ignited the Renaisance
Thank to Contantinople' wall that pile of brick and marble that guarded them for so long we still have our classical past
And for a thousand years the fate of Europe depended on them
Contantinople was designed to be the center of the world
When the frontier of the Roman Empire began to crumble in the fourth century the capital was moved to the cultured wealthy and still stable east
There at the crossroad between Europe and Asia the hub of the major trade route of the ancient world the Emperor Contantine built his city
This was the city of libraries in universities 20 times the size of London or Paris at the time
It contained the priceless knowledge of the classical world which was fading in the West
To protect this masterpiece from it many gravitational Contantine' successors built the finet defensive fortification ever made
The first line of protection was a moat 60 feet wide and 22 feet deep stretching all four miles from coast to coast
Pype from inside the city could fill it at the first sight of the enemy and a short wall protected archers who could fire at the soaked soldier trying to swim across
Those who were lucky enough to clear the moat had to contend with an unseasing barrage from the 27 foot outer wall above
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast The most important wall in western history aren't even in the West
Arrow spear or far worse Greek fire an ancient form of napalm that would ignite on contact and couldn't be extinguished by water would rain down on them
That little guy contain almost half of the neurons in the entire brain
Patient who separated generation from this region something called spino-cerebellar attackia show a lack of coordination that results in stiff legs wide stance and a lumbering walk
My money' been cerebral
TK: To shine right? OK so we've nailed it motor problems
No what about that whole groaning lack of talking thing?
You know it sounds kind of like expressive aphaia or Broca' aphaia which makes producing words difficult
This is caused by damage to the inferior frontal gyru where possibly the anterior inula both region behind your temporary in Malaa to your head
Zombies definitely can't communicate That' for sure
But they don't seem to do a good job of understanding things either
Watch this: A walker your father smell of elder bearies
See no reaction
Either it' not a monu piethon fan or it can't understand me
I'd say this is like spot-on fluent or vernaqui ephaia damage to an area at the junction of two of the brain' lobe temporal and parietal typically on the left side of the brain is the culprit
This area is physically connected to Broca’ area that you mentioned by a massive bundle of neural fiber called the arcuate faciculus
I hypotheize that this massive bundle of action is completely wiped out in the zombie
It would be like taking out the superhighway between two cities
One city that physician a product and the other that ship it out to the rest of the world
Without that highway the product distribution just shut down
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast So how did it get to be this way?
So basically it' a mood point to reason with the zompy since they can't understand you let alone talk back
EM: Well it' my professional opinion that the large-guilding bite mark on it shoulder might have somebody to do it
I mean you could try men but I'm going to stay in the side of the dance
ES: Thank I mean what causes it behavioral abnormalities?
Well we know all behavior are rooted in the brain so I'd expect that something' gone executive wrong probably in there
EM: Thank again Dr Obvious
Let me be more specific if light may be more specific if life may be more specific if it may be more specific if it may be more specific if it may be more specific if it might be more specific if it may be more specific if it may be more specific if it may be more specific if it may be more specific if it may be more specific if it may be more specificy if it may be more specificy if it may be more specificy if it may be more specific if it may be more specificy if it may be more specific if it' if it' if it' if it might be more specificy if it may be more specificy if it' specificy if it may be more specificy if it may be more specificy if it may be more specificy if it may be more specific if it' be more specificy if it may be more specificy if it' be more specificy if it' be more specific
What changes in the brain would have to occur in order to cause this kind of behavior?
EM: Well let' see
The first thing I noticed is how it move
Stiff legged with long lumbering step very slow and art or not
Obviously like what you'd see in Parkinson' disease
Maybe something' wrong with it baal ganglia
Those are a collection of deep brain region that regulate movement through a neurochemical called dopamine
Although most people think of dopamine as the happy chemical of the brain the dopamine-containing neurons in the baal ganglia die off in Parkinson' disease That' what causes her
Make it more and more difficult to initiate action
Why?
Look again at how it move Stiff legs long stance
These aren’t Parkinsonian movement Parkinson’ vision take short shuffling step
And the posters are wrong
This looks to me like what happens when cerebellum damaged
The cerebellum' a little call of flower-haped area in the back of your head but don't let it size fool you
So how exactly does someone go about protecting their own political party and actually jerry-mandering a district?
There are two successful practice
Packing a district and cracking a district
Packing is the process of drawing district lines and packing in your opponent like cattle into as few district as possible
If more district equal more vote the fewer the district there are the fewer vote the opposition party will get
Packing then decrease the opponent' voter strength and influence
Cracking is the opposite taking one district and cracking it into several pieces
This is usually done in district where your opponent has many supporters
Cracking spread these supporters out among many district denying your opponent a lot of vote
When you have a large number of people who would generally vote for one type of party those folks are known as a voting block
Cracking is a way to break that all up
So when would a party choose to pack their opponent' district rather than crack them?
Well that really depend on what the party needs
To dilute your opponent' voters you could pack them into one district and leave the surrounding district filled with voters of your own party
Or if you and your party are in power when it' time to redraw district lines you could redraw district and crack up a powerful district and spread your opponent' voters out across several neighboring district
So Governor Jerry in 1812 wanted to gain an advantage for his party and redrew district lines in his state in such a crazy way we have a whole new word and way of thinking about how political parties can gain advantage over their opponent
Politician think of creative ways to draw district every few years
So the next time an election comes around and politician ask people to vote be sure to look up the shape of your district and the district that surround it
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Most people have heard the word "jarymandering" once or twice probably during a presidential election
How wide does your district stretch across your state?
What exactly is jerry membrane?
Are all of the district in your state relatively the same shape?
How many other district does your district touch?
But always be sure to ask yourself does my district look like a salamander?
Eentially it' the process of giving one political party and advantage over another political party by redrawing district lines
It' like Democrat trying to gain an advantage over Republican or Republican trying to gain an advantage over Democrat
You see each party want to gain as many district as possible so they can do things like control the state budget or set natural up to win even more district in the future
So to understand how this process began and how it continue today we must go back to 1812 in Maachusett Elbridge Jerry the governor of Maachusett supported and signed a bill to allow redistricting
That is redrawing the boundaries that separate district
The catch the new lines with favorite Jerry' own political party the Democratic ReOkayan party which no longer exist
You see Jerry wanted his party to win as many state-enit seat as possible
The more members of your party who vote the more likely you are to win an election
The new lines were drawn to include load of areas that would help governor Jerry in the future
They were so strange looking that someone said the new district look like a salamander
The Boston Gazette added Jerry' name to the word salamander and Wallah Jerry Mandoring the process of dividing up and redrawing district to give your political party an advantage
If your candidate win in California they get all 55 of the state' electoral vote
If your candidate lose they get not
This is why many presidential candidate want to wing state like Texas Florida and New York
If you currently add up the electoral vote of those three state you would have 96 electoral vote
Even if a candidate won North Dakota South Dakota Montana Wyomb New Hamphire Connecticut and West Virginia they would only gain 31 electoral vote total from those eight state
Here is where it can get a little trick
On a rare occasion like in the year 2000 someone can win the popular vote but fail to gain 270 electoral vote
This means that the winner may have won and collected their electoral boot by small margin winning just enough state with just enough electoral vote but the losing candidate may have captured large voter margin in the remaining state
If this is the case the very large margin secured by the losing candidate in the other state would add up to over 50 percent of the ballot cast nationally
Therefore the losing candidate may have gained more than 50 percent of the ballot cast by voters but fail to gain 2570 of the electoral vote
Some critic of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to state with large numbers of electoral
Thank you for listening
It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person' vote not one vote in 39 state or the district of Columbia yet the elected president by winning the popular vote to just 11 of these 12 state: California New York Texas Florida Pennylvania Illinois North Carolina Georgia or Virginia
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Most people have heard of the electoral college during presidential election years
What exactly is the electoral college?
This is why both parties pay attention to these stake
However others are you that the electoral college protect small state such as Rod Island Vermont and UK sure and even geographically large state with small population like Laca Wyoming and the Dakota
That' because a candidate can't completely ignore small state because in a close election every electoral vote count
Simply said it is a group of people appointed by each state who formally elect the president who buy President of the United States
There are certain state that have a long history of voting for a particular party
These are known a face system
For the past four election cycle in 1996 2004 and 2008 Democrat could count on state like Oregon Maryland Michigan and Maachusett whereas the Republican could count on state like Miisippi Alabama Kanas and Idaho
State that are teetering between parties are called swing state
In the past four election cycle Ohio and Florida have been swing state twice providing electoral vote for a Democratic candidate and twice providing electoral vote for a Republican candidate
Think about it: Do you live in a safe state?
If so is it a democratic or Republican safe state?
Do you live in a swing state?
Are your neighboring state swing or safe?
I the population in your state increasing or decreasing?
And do not forget near watching the elector return on election night every four years and the big map of the United States is on the screen know that the magic numbers 270 and start adding
To understand how this process began and how it continue today we can look at the constitution of the United States: article two section one claw two of the Constitution
It specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have
Since 1964 there have been 538 electors in each presidential lecture
How did they decide on the number 530?
Well the number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress
For 135 representative plus 100 centimeter and three electors from the district of Columbia
Eentially the Democratic candidate and Republican candidate are each trying to add up the electors in every state so that they surpa 270 electoral vote or just over half of 538 vote and win the presidencies
So how do state even get electoral vote?
Each state receive a particular number of electors based on population size
The census is conducted every 10 years so every time the census happens state might gain or lose a few electoral vote
Let' say you're a voter in California a state with 55 electoral vote
Because without an atmosphere the planet is in a vacuum and liquid water is stable in a vacuum
For example our moon has no atmosphere and so if you spill some water on the moon it will either boil away as vapor or freeze solid to make ice
Without the pressure of an atmosphere liquid water can't survive
choosing the planet needs to be at the right distance from it star
Too close and the surface temperature will exceed the boiling point of water and ocean will turn to vapor
Too far and the surface temperature will fall below the freezing point of water causing the ocean to turn to ice
Fire or ice for life as we know it neither will suffice
You can imagine that the perfect zone where water stay liquid looks kind of like a belt around the star
We call that belt the habitable zone
So when we search for habitable world we definitely want to look for planet in the habitable zone around their stars
Those region are the best bet to find planet like Earth
But while habital zone are a pretty good place to begin the search for planet with life there are a couple of complications
First a planet isn't necessarily habitable just because it' in the habitable zone
oppress the planet Venus in our solar system
If you were an alien astronomer you think Venus is a pretty good bet for life
It' the right size it has an atmosphere and it' in the habitable zone of our sun
Each of those galaxies contain about 100 billion stars
An alien astronomer might see it as Earth' twin
But Venus is not habitable at least not at it surface
Not by life as we know it It' too hot
That' because Venus' atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide an important greenhouse gas
In fact it atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide and is almost 100 times thicker than our own
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast The universe contain about 100 billion galaxies
As a result the temperature on Venus is hot enough to melt lead and the planet is dry as a bone
So finding planet of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning
We also want to know about the makeup of their atmosphere
The second complication emerge when we look a little more deeply at planet Earth
In the last 30 years we've discovered microbes living in all sort of extreme environment
Many of those stars have planet orbiting them
We find them in fishers of rock miles intuitive our feet in boiling water of the ocean floor in acidic water of thermal spring and in cloud droplet miles above our head
These so-called extremophiles aren't rare
Some scientists estimate that the mass of microbes living deep underground equal the mass of all the life at Earth' surface
So how do we look for life in all that immenity?
These subterranean microbes don't need ocean or sunshine
These discoveries suggest that Earth-like planet may be only the tip of the astrobiological iceberg
It' possible that life might persist in aquifers intuitive the surface of Mars
Microbe may thrive on Jupiter' moon Europa where liquid water ocean probably lie intuitive the icy crust
Another ocean intuitive the surface of Saturn' moon Enceladu is the source of geyers erupting into space
It' like searching for a needle in trillion of haytack
Could these geyers be raining microbes?
Could we flies through them to find out?
And what about life as we don't know it using a liquid other than water?
Maybe we are the crazy creature living in an unusual and extreme environment
Maybe the real habitable zone is so large that there are billion of needles in those trillion of haytack
Maybe in the big scheme of things Earth is only one of many different kinds of habitable world
The only way to find out is to go out and explore
We might want to focus our search on planet that we know can support life as we know it what we call habitable world
What do such planet look like?
To answer that question we don't look out there
Instead we look at ourselves at Earth
Because this is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable
When we look at Earth from space we see a blue watery world
It' no coincidence that three-quarter of the surface is covered by ocean
Because of it unique chemical and physical properties water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it
And so we get especially excited about other world on which water is abundant
Fortunately water is very common in the universe
But life needs water in the form of liquid not ice and not vapor and that' a little bit less common
For a planet of liquid water at it surface three things are important
First the planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity keep the water molecules from flying off into space
For example Mars is smaller than Earth and so has less gravity and that' one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere and no ocean at it surface
Second the planet needs to have an atmosphere Why?
The story of the anti-hero usually unfold something like this
The anti-hero initially conform ignorantly accepting the established view a typical unquetioning brainwashed member of society
The anti-hero struggle to conform all the while starting to object perhaps finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions and naively unwisely sharing those questions with an authority figure
The anti-hero openly challenges society and tries to fight against the lie and tactic used to Consider the populace
This step for the anti-hero is seldom a matter of brave wise and heroic opposition
Maybe the anti-hero fight and phenomenon in destroying the impressive government with a lot of impossible luck
Perhaps he or she run away his scape to fight another day
All too often though the anti-hero is killed or brainwashed to return to conformity with the masses
No heroic triumph here no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern world inpiring others to fight or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive army of the evil empire
Our pedestrian ancetor calmed our fear of powerlessness by giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demon and monster that we somewhated haunted the night beyond our campfire
But eventually we realized the monster did not lie out there they reside inside of us
Beowulf' greatest enemy was mortality
A fellow' jealousy
Hiccup self-doubt
And in the tales of the ineffectual anti-hero in the stories of Guy Montag and Winton Smith lie the warning of contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fear but we are not strong enough to defeat the monster
Only this time not the monster chaed away by the campfire but the very monster who built the campfire in the first place
From the divine heroes like Hercules down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as Beowulf the Great Leaders such as King Arthur and the great put flawed heroes like Mick Beth or Athello
Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter Luke Skywalker or Hiccup until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero
Contrary to the sound the anti-hero is not the villain not the antagonist
The anti-hero is actually the main character in some contemporary works of literature
Guy Montag in Fahrenheit 451 Winton Smith in 1984 who unwittingly end up challenging those in power -- that is those who abuse their power to brainwash the popular to believe that the ill of society have been eliminated
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Literary critic North of fry once observed that in our primitive days our literary heroes were well nearly god and as civilization advanced they came down the mountain of the god so to speak and became more human more flawed less heroic
Ideally those who challenge the establishment should be wise confident brave physically strong with a type of charima that inspire followers
The anti-hero however at best demonstrate a few underdeveloped trait at worst is totally inept
It all begin in the brain
The hypothalamus the master controller of your hormone release something called corticopin-releasing hormone
This escape the pituitary gland a pea-ized gland found at the base of the brain to release adrenal corticutropic hormone which then interrupt the adrenal gland sitting on top of the kidney to release cortiol the major stress hormone
These themselves chemical are a great help when you need to run away quickly or do superhuman feat of courage but when you're simply sitting these stress hormone collect in the body and affect your overall health
Stre hormone increase inflammation in the body suppress the/ system which makes you more susceptible to infection by acne-causing bacteria and can even increase oil production in the skin
And this is the perfect storm for forming a pimple
Cortiol is a major stress hormone involved in making skin cells churn out oily lipid from special gland called sabaceous gland
The closer he gets the more nervous he becomes the budding sit on his nose growing bigger and bigger until it practically eclipes his face
But when there' too much of these oily lipid called sea bum they can plug up this swollen and flame pores and trap the peky acne-causing bacteria inside where they set up house and thrive
Out a dash of inflammatory neuropeptide released by the nervous system when you're well nervous and angry zit follow
To make matter worse just in as a boy meaning he' got more testosterone than girls
Tetosterone is another hormone that increase oil production in the skin
So his already oily skin together with a boost in oil and inflamation from stress is the perfect environment for bacteria to swell swell swell swell swell swell swell swell swell swell swell well up into a major zit
So what could have just been done to avoid the big pimple?
Streful situation are unavoidable
But we can try to change our response so that we're not so stressed in the end
And had he been confident in approaching her she might not have noticed the temporary or he might not have had one
She looks at him hovering nearby see the massive zit and giggles
He slum away feeling sick
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast She' only a few feet away
Stre can sure make a mess and it happens to both teens and adult
But how does it happen?
Let' rewind to before the zit to before Justin even see his crush
Already late for school Justin got to class just in time to hear the teacher say "Pop quiz."
He hadn't been his homework the night before and felt more and prepared than the ambished World War II soldier he was supposed to write about
A sudden rush of panic swept over his body leaving him with sweaty palm a fogy mind and a racing heart
He stumbled out of class in a days and ran straight into his all-time crush spiking up his stress
Stre is a general biological response to a potential danger
In primitive cavemen terms stress can make you fight for your life or run for your life if for example you're confronted by a hungry saber-tooth tiger
Special chemical called stress hormone run through your body giving you more oxygen and power to run away from danger or to face it and fight for your life hence the term fight or flight
But when you don't fight or take flight you face the plight
When we're taking final exam sitting in traffic or pondering pollution we internalize stress
Or maybe that
Maybe the character are a teenager and his mother and they're supposed to be vegetarian but the mother saw him eating a burger
So let' say you've decided on some character
This is anti-ocial skill number two: start pretending they're real
What are they like? Where are they from? What music do they listen to?
Spend some time with them
If you're autobut think about what they might be doing if they were there too
When they talk on the phone listen to music draw pictures sleep
What we say depend on who we are
An older person might speak differently than a younger person
Someone from the south might speak differently than someone from the north
Once you know your character you can figure out how they talk
At this stage it' helpful to use anti-ocial skill number three muttering to yourself
When you speak your character' words you can hear whether they sound themselves and fix them if necessary
recommend most people are usually pretty informal when they speak
They use simple language and contractions
So do not attempt to lie to me sounds more themselves as "Don't try to lie to me."
Also keep it short
People tend to speak in short burst not lengthy speeches
And help the dialogue do the work
Ask yourself do I really need that adverb?
For instance your money or your life she said "Trendingly."
Here threateningly is redundant so you can get rid of it
But if the words and the action don't match an adverb can be helpful
Your money or your life she said "Lovingly."
So to recap: First eavedrop next pretend imaginary people are real
Finally mudder to yourself and write it all down
You already have everything you need
This is fictional dialogue or how to hear voice in your head
Romeo: "Oh well that leave me so unatisfied."
Juliet what satisfaction cant thou have tonight?
Translator: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Dialogue gives a story color makes it exciting and move it forward
Romeo the exchange of thy love' faithful vow for mine
Without dialogue so what goes into writing effective dialogue?
Well there are social skills making friends solving conflict being pleasant and polite
We won't be using any of those today
Instead we'll be working on -- let' call them anti-ocial skills
If you're a writer you may already have a few of these
The first is Eve' dropping
If you're riding a bus and here an interesting conversation you could write it all down
Of course when you write fiction you're not currency real people you're making up character
But sometimes the words you overhear can give you ideas
I did not says one person
I saw you the other replie
Who might be saying those words?
Maybe it' two kids in a class and the boy think the girl pushed him
Maybe it' a couple but one of them is a vampire and the woman vampire saw the man flirting with a zombie
Nobody' found eka-aluminum yet so we don't know anything about it right?
Wrong Baed on where it' located I can tell you all about it
First of all an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68 about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom
When echo aluminum is isolated you'll see it' a solid metal at room temperature
It' shiny it conduct heat really well it can be flattened into a sheet stretched into a wire but it melting point is low like freakishly low
Oh and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six gram
Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave
A few years after this prediction a French guy named Paul Amiel Accorded Waspeldlong discovered a new element in orse sample and named it gallium after goal the historical name for France
Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table
It' eka-aluminum so we're Mendeleev' prediction right
It' not just in every flood lab worldwide it' found on t-shirt coffee mug and shower curtain
Gallium' atomic weight is 6972
A cubic centimeter of it weigh 59 gram
It' a solid metal at room temperature but it melt at a paltry 30 degrees Celius -- 85 degrees Fahrenheit
It melt in your mouth and in your hand
Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time: scandium germanium ranium
The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetia
Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was asleepd in a cyclotron in 1937 almost 70 years after Demetry predicted it existence 30 years after he died
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast The periodic table is instantly recognizable
Dimitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907 but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor
In 1955 scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atom of a previously undicovered element
This element filled an empty spot in the periodic table at number 101 and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963
But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon
There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winner but only 15 scientists have an element named after them
So the next time you stare at a periodic table whether it' on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug Dmitri Mendeleev the architect of the periodic table will be staring back
It' a massive slab of human genius up there with the Taj Mahal the Mona Lia and the ice cream sandwich and the table' creator Dmitri Mendeleev is a bonified science hall-of-famer
But why? What' so great about him in his table?
I it because you made a comprehensive list of the known elements?
Now you don't earn a spot in Science Fall Hello just for making a list
Beside Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that
I it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together?
Not really that had already been done too
So what was Mendeleev' genius?
Let' look at one of the first version of the periodic table from around 1870
Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbol arranged in a table
Check out the entry up a third column fifth row
There' a dash there
From that unasuming placeholder spring the raw brilliance of Mendeleev
That dash is science
By putting that dash there Dmitri was making a bold statement
He said "And I'm paraphraing here You'll haven't discovered this element yet In the meantime I'm going to give it a name."
It' one step away from aluminum so we'll call it eka-aluminum echo being Sankrit for one
For example here' what the Lord' prayer looks like in Old English
At first glance it may look unfamiliar but update the spelling a bit and you'll see many common English words
So the centuries passed with Britain' happily speaking Old English but in the 700 a series of Viking invaions began which continued until a treaties put the island in half
On one side we're the snaphot
On the other side were the Danes who spoke a language called Old Norse
As Saxon fell in love with their cute Danish neighbor and marriage blurred the boundaries Old Norse mixed with Old English and many old Norse words like frackle leg root skin and want are still a part of our language
300 years later in 106 the Norman Conquet brought war again to the British Iles
I want you to imagine each of these two scene in as much detail as you can
The Norman were Viking who had settled in France
They had Internationaled the Viking Language and culture and favor of a French lifestyle but they still fought like liking
They placed a Norman king on the English throne and for three centuries French was the language of the British royalty
Society in Britain came to have two levels: French-peaking arist excess and old English-peaking peasant
The French also brought many Roman Catholic clergymen with them who added Latin words to the mix
Old English adapted and grew as thousands of words flowed in many having to do with government law and arist excess
Word like council marriage sovereign govern damage and parliament
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast I am going to start with a challenge
As the language expanded English speaker quickly realized what to do if they wanted to sound sophisticated they would use words that had come from French or Latin
Seen number one: they gave us a hearty welcome
Anglo Saxon words seem so plain like the Anglo Saxon peasant who spoke them
Let' go back to the two sentence you thought about earlier
When you pictured the hearty welcome did you see an earthy scene with relative hugging and talking loudly?
Where they're drinking beer?
Were they wearing lumberjack shirt and jean?
And what about the corgeal reception?
At that you pictured a farmer classy and refined crowd
Blazeers and skirt wine and caviar
Why is this?
How is it that phrase that are considered just about synonymous by the dictionary can evoke such different pictures and feeling?
Well who are the people who are giving a hearty welcome?
Hardy and welcome are both sack and words
Corridal and reception come from French
The connotation of mobility and authority has persisted around words of French origin
And the connotation of peasantry real people salt of the earth has persisted around sack in words
Even if you never heard this history before the memory of it persist and the feeling evoked by the words you speak
On some level it' a story you already knew because whether we realize it consciously or only subconciously our history lives in the words we speak and hear
What are they wearing?
What are they drinking? What are they drinking?
Okay seem too they gave us a corgal reception
How are these people standing?
What expression are on their face?
What are they wearing and drinking?
Fix these pictures in your mind' eye and then jot down a sentence or two to describe them
We'll come back to them later
Now on to our story
In the year 400 CE
The calt in Britain were ruled by Roman
This had one benefit for the Celt the Roman protected them from the barbarian Saxon tribe of northern Europe
But then the Roman Empire began to crumble and the Roman withdrew from Britain
With the Roman gone the Germanic tribe the angle sack and jute and freeze quickly sailed across the water did away with the celt and formed kingdom in the British Iles
For several centuries these tribe lived in Britain and their Germanic language Anglo Saxon became the common language what we call Old English
Although modern English speaker may think Old English sounds like a different language if you look and listen closely you'll find many words that are recognizable
From here your strategy will depend on where the cancer is and how far it' progressed
If the tumor is slow-growing and in one place surgery might be all unique if anything
If the tumor is fast-growing or invading nearby tissue your doctor might horrible radiation or surgery followed by radiation
If the cancer has spread or if it' inherently everywhere like a leukemia your doctor will most likely horrible chemotherapy or a combination of radiation and chemo
Radiation and most form of chemo work by physically shredding the cells' DNA or disrupting the copying machinery
But neither radiation nor chemotherapeutic drugs target only cancer cells
Radiation hit whatever you pointed at and your blood stream carries chemotherapeutic all over your body
So what happens when different cells get hit?
Let' look at a healthy liver cell a healthy hair cell and a cancerous cell
The healthy liver cell divide only when it' stressed the healthy hair cell divide miraclely and the cancer cell divide even more miraclely and recklessly
When you take a chemotherapeutic drug it will hit all of these cells
And remember that the drugs work typically by disrupting cell division
So every time a cell divide it open itself up to attack and that means that the more miraclely a cell divide the more likely the drug is to kill it
Then that cell divide in we are two cells and four then eight
So remember that hair cell
It divide miraclely and isn't a threat
And there are other miraclely dividing cells in your body like skin cells gut cells and blood cells
So the list of unpleasant side effects of cancer treatment parallel these tissue types: hair loss skin rahe nauea vomiting fatigue weight loss and pain
That makes sense because these are the cells that get hit the hardest
So in the end it' all about growth
Cancer hijack cells' themselves division machinery and force them to put the pedal to the metal growing rapidly and recklessly
Cell form tissue tissue form organ organ form us
But using chemotherapeutic drugs we take advantage of that reconstructness and we turn cancer' main strength into a weakness
These cell division by which we go from a single cell to 100 trillion cells are called growth
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast We all start life as one single cell
And growth seems like a simple thing because when we think of it we typically think of someone getting taller or later in life wider but to cells growth isn't simple
Cell division is an intricate chemical dance that' part individual part community-driven
And in a neighborhood of 100 trillion cells sometimes things go wrong
Maybe an individual cells set of instructions or DNA gets a typo what we call a mutation
Most of the time the cell sense mistake and shut itself down or the system detect a disappearmaker and eliminate it
But enough mutation can bypa these failafe driving the cell to divide recklessly
That one road cell becomes two then four and eight
At every stage the incorrect instructions are passed along to the cells' offpring
Week months or years after that one rogue cell transformed you might see your doctor about a lump in your breast
Difficulty going to the elsewhere could reveal a problem in your intestine prostate or bladder
Or a synthetic blood test might count too many white cells or elevated liver purchase
Your doctor deliver the bad news; it' cancer
What if that sidekick was a professional cake carrier?
Then maybe there would have been a reasonable expectation that he would have been more skilled when carrying a ridiculously large cake
Then when that reasonable expectation was not met by the tripping sidekick irony would have been exemplified
Another example another example
A gesture citizen texting and blocking
The common and reasonable expectation of more mature men and women as if they don't like or no technology that they have a hard time turning on a computer or that they have the old brick cell phone from the 1980
One should not expect them to be connected high-tech or savvy enough to text or to be blogging which must seem like some sort of new-fangled thing that back in my day they never had
So when Granny pull out her smartphone to post pictures of her denture or her grandkid irony and sew
Reasonable expectations of the situation are not met
That is irony that is irony
So while the cake dropper might not be ironic there are all kinds of situation in life that are
Go out and find those true example of irony
He trip fall and face plants into the cake
Your friend double over with laughter and says "Sorrydiculate slironic."
Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast Picture this: your friend and you are watching a sitcom and a say sidekake walk into a room carrying a four-tiered wedding cake
I'll click "What do you do?"
Do you laugh along with the laugh track and let this grievous misinterpretation of irony go?
Or you throw cushion to the wind and explain the true meaning of irony
If you're me you choose the ladder
Unfortunately irony has been completely misunderstood
We tend to throw out that term whenever we see something funny or coincidental
And while many example of true irony can be funny that is not the driving factor of being ironic
A situation is only ironic if what happens is the exact opposite of what was expected
If you expect A but get B then you have irony
Let' take the slaptick cake situation as an example
When someone walk in precariously balancing something that shouldn't be carried alone trip fall and makes a mess it is funny but it' not ironic
In fact you probably expect someone who is single-handedly carrying a huge cake to trip
When he does reality align with expectations and so that is not irony
But what if the say sidekick walked in wearing a gold medal that he'd won at the cake-walking event at the Atlanta Olympic in 1996?
Undertanding these historical connection not only help us to spell doubt but also to understand the meaning of these more sophisticated words
But the story doesn't end there
If we look even deeper we can see beyond the murder of a doubt just how revealing that bee can be
There are only two base words in all of English that have the letter "D-O-U-B," one is doubt and the other is "Double."
We can build lots of other words on each of these base like doubtful and doubtless or doublet and redouble and doubloon
It turns out that if we look into their history we can see that they both derive from the same Latin form
The meaning of double too is reflected in a deep understanding of doubt
See when we doubt when we heitate we second guess ourselves
When we have doubt about something when we have questions or confuion we are of two mind
Historically before English began to borrow words from French it already had a word for doubt
That Old English word was "tweogan," a word whose relationship to "two" is clear in it spelling as well
So the next time you're in doubt about why English spelling works the way it does take a second look
What you find just might make you do it double-take
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast People often think the word "doubt" spelling is a little crazy because of the letter "b."
Since it doesn't spell a sound most folks can't figure out what it' doing there
But in spite of what most of us learn in school sound is never the most important aspect of spelling an English word
A word' meaning and history need to come first
To doubt means to question to waver to heitate
As a noun it means uncertainty or confuion
The present-day English word "doubt" started as a Latin word "dubitare."
It first moved from Latin into French where it lost both it book sound and it letter bee
And then it came into English in the 13th century
About 100 years later scribe who wrote English but also new Latin started to reinert the bee into the word "pelling," even though no one pronounced it that way
But why would they do this?
Why would anyone in their right mind reinert a silent letter into a spelling?
Well because they knew Latin the scribe understood that the root of doubt had a be in it
Over time even as fewer literate people knew Latin the bee was kept because it marked important meaningful connection to other related words like dubious and indubitably which were subsequently barred into English from the same Latin root Dubitara
And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect
It' called color
That' right Color is nothing more than a measure of how quickly the light wave are waving
If our eyes were quick enough we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly like we can with the cork in the ocean
But the frequency of the light we see is so high it wave up and down over 400 million million million times a second that we can't possibly see it as a wave but we can tell by looking at it color what it frequencies
One of the most striking properties about life is that it has color
The lowest frequency light that we can see is red and the highest frequency is purple
In between all the other frequencies form a continuous bound of color called the visible spectrum
So what if you had a yellow pencil sitting on your desk?
Well the sun emit all color of light so light of all color is hitting your pencil
The pencil looks yellow because it reflect yellow light more than it reflect the other color
What happens to the blue purple and red life?
They get absorbed and the energy they are carrying is turned into heat
It' similar with objects of other color
Blue things reflect blue light red things reflect red light and so on
White objects reflect all color of light while black things do exactly the opposite and absorb at all frequencies
This by the way is why it' rebuild to wear your favorite metallica t-shirt on a sunny day
To understand the succeed of color it help to think about light as a wave
But before we get to that let' talk a little bit about wave in general
Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the ocean watching a carke bub up and down in the water
The first thing you notice about the motion is that it repeat itself
The correct trace the same path over and over again up and down up and down up and don't
This repetitive our periodic motion is characteristic of wave
Then you notice something else then you notice something else
Uing a stopwatch you measure the time it takes for the piece of cork to go from it highest position down to it lowest and then back up again
Suppose this takes two second
To use the physics jargon you've measured the period of the wave that the cork is bobbing on
That is how long it takes a wave to go through it full range of motion once
The same information can be expressed in a different way by calculating the wave' frequency
Frequency as the name suggest tell you how miracle the wave are
That is how many of them go by in one second?
If you know how many second one full wave takes then it' easy to work out how many wave go by in one second
In this case since each wave takes two second the frequency is 05 wave per second
So enough of my bobbing cork what about light and color?
If light is a wave then it must have a frequency right?
Well yes it does
This city we just saw is different in everyone
Every person has a unique and diverse community of gut microbes that can process food in different ways
One person' gut microbes may be capable of releasing only a fraction of the calories that another person' gut microbes can extract
So what determine the membership of our gut microbial community?
Well things like our genetic makeup and the microbes we encounter throughout our lives can contribute to our microbial ecosystem
The food we eat also influence which microbes live in our gut
For example food made of complex molecules like an apple require a lot of different microbial workers to break it down
But if a food is made of simple molecules like a lollipop some of these workers are put out of a job
Those workers leave the city never to return
What doesn't function well are gut microbial communities with only a few different types of workers
For example humans who suffer from disease like diabetes or chronic gut inflammation typically have less microbial psycho in their gut
We don't fully understand the best way to manage our individual microbial societies but it is likely that lifestyle changes such as eating a varied diet of complex plant-based food can help revitalize our microbial ecosystem in our gut and across the entire landscape of our body
So we are really not alone in our body
Our bodies are home to millions of different microbes and we need them just as much as they need us
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Being human we each view ourselves as a unique and independent individual but we're never alone
As we learn more about how our microbes interact with each other and with our bodies we will reveal how we can nurture this complex invisible world that shape our personal identity our health and our well-being
Millions of microcopic being mushroom our bodies and no two bodies are the same
Each is a different habitat for microbial communities from the arid desert of our skin to the village on our lip and the cities in our mouth
Even every tooth is it own distinctive neighborhood and our gut are teeming metropolise of interacting microbes
And in these bustling street of our gut we see a constant influx of food and every microbe has a job to do
Here' a cellulistic bacteria for example
Their one job is to break down cellulose a common compound in vegetable into sugar
Those simple sugar then move along to the repirator another set of microbes that snatch up these simple sugar and burn them as fuel
As food travel through our digestive tract it reaches the fermentors who extract energy from these sugar by converting them into chemical like Manhattan and hydrogen gas which they spew out as waste products
Deep around the depth of our gut city the syntrophy eke out a living off the fermenter' trash
At each step of this process energy is released and that energy is absorbed by the cells of the digestive tract
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast You might have heard that light is kind of wave and that the color of an object is related to the frequency of light wave it reflect
The column however are a different story
There are three kinds of colon cells that roughly glacier to the color red green and blue
When you see a color each cone send it own distinct signal to your brain
For example suppose that yellow light that is real yellow light with a yellow frequency is shining on your eye
You don't have a colon specifically for detecting yellow but yellow is kind of close to green and also kind of close to red so both the red and green cones get activated and each send a signal to your brain saying so
Of course there' another way to activate the red cones and the green cones simultaneously if both red light and green light are present at the same time
The point is your brain receive the same signal regardless of whether you see life that has the yellow frequency or life that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies
That' why for light red plus green equal yellow
And how come you can't detect color when it' dark?
Well the ride cells in your retina take over in low-light conditions
You only have one kind of rod cell and so there' only one type of signal that can get sent to your brain: life or no life
Having only one kind of light detector doesn't leave any room for seeing color
There are infinitely many different physical color but because we only have three kinds of cones the brain can be tricked into thinking it' seeing any color by carefully adding together the right combination of just three color: red green and blue
This property of human vision is really useful in the real world
For example TV manufacturing
Instead of having to put infinitely many color in your TV set to simulate the real world TV physicianrs only have to put three red green and blue which is lucky for them really
High-frequency light wave look violent low-frequency light wave look red and in-between frequencies look yellow green orange and so on
You might call this idea physical color because it says that color is a physical property of light itself
It' not dependent on human perception
And while this isn't wrong it isn't quite the whole story either
For instance you might have seen this picture before
As you can see the region where the red and green light overlap is yellow
When you think about it this is pretty weird
Because light is a wave two different frequencies shouldn't interact with each other at all they should just co-exist like singers singing in harmony
So in this yellow-looking region two different kinds of light wave are present: one with a red frequency and one with a green frequency
There' no yellow light present at all
So how come this region where the red and green light mix looks yellow to us?
To understand this you have to understand a little bit about biology in particular about how humans see color
Light perception happens in a paper-thin layer of cells called the retina that cover the back of your eyeball
In the retina there are two different types of life-detecting cells rod and cones
The rod are used for seeing in low-like conditions and there' only one kind of those
The dragon continued eating people
So addition tried but was thrown aside
Exponent leaped at the beast and was quickly squashed
Nothing was working
The muketeers huddled and formulated a plan
They would attack in sequence but who should go first?
They pick hered for a while the dragon ate a few more princees and then they finally agreed
They jumped into the first smallest parenthees inside the Great Puff the Digit Dragon
Parenthees pointed out where to work first and protected experience multiplication division addition in subtraction while they diced and sliced
First here then move over there then there
Look out There' another set
Parenthees pointed and Exponent took the lead
Then it was multiplication divisioning addition and subtraction each in turn always the same order
PEM DAMS when they finished that set they went to another and another always working inside the parenthees in PEM DAS order
Come thank you TED
Pend us There' another spot
Don't forget there can be parenthees inside parenthees
There' one where I know there' one there
And that tricky explain
There we go
Finally the PEMDA' mosquitoes had widowed puff down to his last fiercem roar
But having vanquished Puff the Magic Digit Dragon all the Empire' numbers spraying again from this tiny little number one and they all lived happily ever after
Translator: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Once upon a time in the magical and very round land of pie there lived six swashbuckling muketeers
advertise for the emperor number which they threw into the mouth of an ancient creature nesting in the desert
Being lovely
Their name were parenthees exponent multiplication division addiction and subtraction
But each was known best by his or her mark: the two hands ready to catch a fly of parenthees the small and raised digit of exponent the lighty act of multiplication slash of division plus of addition and well you can guess the symbol by which a little subtraction was best known
The land of pie was not necessarily the most peaceful creep and that' why the numbers of the kingdom needed the mosquitoes
The land of pie had been ruled by the numbers as anarcho-yndicalist commune each number with a vote but one powerful number from what we'll call the imperial Senate engineered a war between some robot things and night of the kingdom and then installed himself as Supreme Emplora and then puff the Magic Digit Dragon and a princeer and well all the other numbers in the Land of Pi actually and well all the other numbers in the Land of Pi actually
It was kind of a big day
Anyway the muketeers were called to action to save the land of pie from the voracious dragon
They rode towards him on their valiant steed and attacked
First much location then parenthees but that didn't work
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast You look down and see a yellow pencil laying on your desk
I it a practical like atom or is it a wave like ripples on the surface of a pond?
Scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years figuring out the answer to this question
Iaac Newton was one of the earliest
Newton believed that light is made up of tiny atom-like particles which he called corpusal
Uing this assumption he was able to explain some properties of light
For example refraction which is how a bean of light appear to bend as it passes from air into water
But in science even geniuses sometimes get things wrong
In the 19th century long after Newton died scientists did a series of experiment that clearly showed that light can't be made up of tiny atom-like particles
For one thing two beam of light that cross path don't interact with each other at all
If light were made of tiny solid ball then you would expect that some of the particles from beam A would crash into some of the particles from Beam B
If that happened the two particles involved in the collision would bounce off in random direction
But that doesn't happen
The beam of light pass right through each other as you can check for yourself with two laser pointers and some chalk dut
For another thing light makes interference patterns
Your eyes and then your brain are collecting all sort of information about the pencil: it size color shape distance and more
Interference patterns are the complicated undulation that happen when two wave patterns tattoo the same space
They can be seen when two objects strategies the surface of a still pond and also when two point-like source of light are placed near each other
Only wave make interference patterns particles don't
And as a bonus understanding that light act like a wave lead themselvesly to an explanation of what color is and where that pencil looks yellow
So it settled in later is a wave right?
Not so fast
In the 20th century scientists did experiment that appear to show light acting like a particle
For instance when you shine light on a metal the light transfer it energy to the atom in the metal in discrete packets called quanta
But we can't just forget about properties like interference either
So these quanta of light aren't at all like the tiny hard sphere Newton imagined
This result that light sometimes behave like a particle and sometimes behave like a wave led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum mechanics
So after all last let' go back to the question "What is life?"
Well light isn't really like anything we're used to dealing with in our everyday lives
Sometimes it behave like a particle and other times it behave like a wave but it isn't exactly like either
But how exactly does this happen?
The ancient Greek were the first to think more or less scientifically about what light is and how vision works
Some Greek philosopher including Plato and Pythagoras thought that light originated in our eyes and that vision happened when little invisible probe were sent together information about fireway objects
It took over a thousand years before the Arab scientist Alhazen figured out that the old Greek theory of life couldn't be right
In Alhazen' picture your eyes don't send out invisible intelligence-gathering probe they simply collect the light that fall into them
Alhazen' theory account for a fact that the Greek couldn't easily explain why it gets dark sometimes
The idea is that very few objects actually emit their own light
The special light-emitting objects like the sun or a light bulb are known as source of light
Most of the things we see like that pencil on your desk are simply reflecting light from a source rather than producing their own
So when you look at your pencil the light that hit your eye actually originated at the sun and has traveled millions of miles across empty space before bouncing off the pencil and into your eye which is pretty cool when you think about it
But what exactly is the stuff that' emitted from the sun and how do we see it?
Again we know more of what is going on than the character do
Picture two character making a plan for a birthday surprise for their roommate while that room made overhear the entire conversation from the hallway
From there confuion and misunderstanding occur and the tenion build
This isn't the same tenion as the horror film since it is probably pretty funny as the character tried to figure out the who and the what but it serve as a great example of the tenion and suspense of dramatic irony
This tenion or suspense in both genre drive the story and keep the plot progressing
The audience want new needs to see the tenion of the dramatic irony broken either by the scary person jumping out of the murder or by someone finally revealing someone' true identity and clearing up the confuion
So when you feel like you are in on a secret that is dramatic irony a hallmark of all the great writer from Shakespeare to Hitchcock
The two genre might seem totally different but the reason they're both so popular is perhaps because of what they have in common: their use of dramatic irony
First let' clarify
There are three types of irony out there
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast What do horror movie and comedies have in common?
Situational irony is when you expect one thing but get the opposite
Verbal irony is when someone says something but truly means the opposite
Dramatic irony though is what we'll be looking at right now
Dramatic irony is when the audience seems to know more about an event a situation or a conversation than the character in the movie on the show or in the book do
The audience is in on a secret that the character have missed
This is a great pedestrian device that create tremendous emotion within that text
Think about it for a moment
How does it feel when in a horror film you know that the scary villain is hiding behind that door in the darkened room?
The music becomes eerie The lighting create complete murder This has to be bad for the hero
Of course though that hero must enter the room to find the villain
You feel tremendous tenion and the suspense of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary but you just don't know when
That tenion is dramatic irony you know something more than the character in the film
Now take the typical comedy
There will probably be some type of misunderstanding
So we decided that OkCupid should ask users questions stuff like "Do you want to have kids one day?"
How often you brush your teeth?
Do you like scary movie?
And big stuff like "Do you believe in God?"
Now a lot of the questions are good for matching like with like that is when both people answer the same way
For example two people who are both into scary movie are probably a better match than one person who is and one person who isn't
But what about a question like "Do you like to be the center of attention?"
If both people in a relationship are saying yes to this then they're going to have massive problems
We realized this early on and so we decided we needed a bit more data from each question
We had to ask people to specify not only their own answer but the answer they wanted from someone else
That worked really well
But we needed one more dimension
Some questions tell you more about a person than others
For example a question about politics something like which is worse: book burning or flag burning
might reveal more about someone than their taste in movie
And it doesn't make sense to weigh all things equally so we added one final data point
For everything that OkCupid ask you you have a chance to tell us the role it play in your life
This range from irrelevant to mandatory
So now for every question we have three things for our algorithm: first your answer second how you want someone else your potential match to answer and three how important the question is to you at all
With all this information OkCupid can figure out how well two people will get along
The algorithm crunches the numbers and gives us the result
As a practical example let' look at how we'd match you with another person
Let' call him "B."
Your match percentage with bee is based on questions you've both answered
Let' call that set of common questions "."
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Hello my name is Christian Runner and I was one of the founders of OkCuping
As a very simple example we use a small set S with just two questions in common and computer match from that
Here are two example questions
It' now one of the biggest dating site in the United States
The first one let' say is how messy are you?
And the answer possibilities are very messy average and very organized
And let' say you answered very organized and you'd like someone else to answer very organized and the question is very important to you
Phyically you're a neat freak
Your need you want someone else to be neat and that' it
And let' say B was a little bit different
He answered very organized for himself but average is OK with him as an answer from someone else and the question is only a little important to him
Let' look at the second question: It' the one from our previous example Do you like to be the center of attention?
Like almost everyone at the site I was a math major and as you might expect we're known for the analytic approach we have taken to love
The ant are just yes and no
Now you've answered no how you want someone else to answer is no and the question is only a little important to you
Now B he' answered yes
He want someone else to answer "no," because he want the spotlight on him and the question is library important to him
So let' try to compute all this
Our first step is since we use computers to do this we need to asign numerical values to ideas like library important and very important because computers need everything in numbers
We at OkCupid decided on the following scale irrelevant is worth zero
A little important is worth it worth it
Someone important is worth 10
Very important is 50
And absolutely mandatory is 250
Next the algorithm makes two simple calculation
The first is how much did be' answer Commun you?
That is how many possible point did be score on your scale?
Well you indicated that bees answer to the first question about messiness was very important to you
We call it our matching out of them
It' where 50 point and be got that right
The second question is worth only one because you said it was only a little important
And B got that wrong so bees answer were 50 out of 51 possible point
Basically OkCupid' matching algorithm help us decide whether two people should go on a date
That' 98 percent satisfactory It' pretty good
The second question the algorithm looks at is how much did you Commun B?
Well B placed one point on your answer to the messiness question and 10 on your answer to the second
Of those 11 that' one plus 10 you earned 10 you guys satisfied each other on the second question
So your answer were 10 out of 11 equal 91 percent satisfactory to be
That' not bad
The final step is to take these two match percentage and get one number for the both of you
To do this the algorithm multiplie your score then takes the end route where end is the number of questions
Because S which is the number of questions in this sample is only two we have match percentage equal the square root of 98 percent times 91 percent
That equal 94 percent
We built our entire business around it
That 94 percent is your match percentage with B
It' a mathematical expression of how happy you'd be with each other based on what we know
Now why does the algorithm multiply as oppoed to say average the two match score together and do the square root business?
In general this formula is called the geometric mean
Which is a great way to combine values that have wide range and represent very different properties
Now algorithm is a fancy word and people like to drop it like it' this big thing
In other words it' perfect for romantic matching
You've got wide range and you've got ton of different data point like I said about movie about politics about religion about everything
Intuitively too this makes sense
Two people Communing each other 50 percent should be a better match than two others who Commun 0 and 100 because affection needs to be mutual
After adding a little correction for margin of guide in the case where we have a very small number of questions like we do in this example we're good to go
Any time OkCupid matches two people it goes through the step we just outlined
First it collect data about your answer then it compare your choices in preference to other people in simple mathematical ways
This the ability to take real-world recruit and make them something microchip can understand is I think the most important skill anyone can have these days
Like you use sentence to tell a story to a person you use algorithm to tell a story to a computer
But really an algorithm is just a systematic step-by-tep way to solve a problem
If you learn the language you can go out and tell your stories
I hope this will help you do that
It doesn't have to be fancy at all
Here in this lesson I'm going to explain how we arrive at our particular algorithm so you can see how it' done
Now why are algorithm even important?
Why does this lesson even exist?
Well notice one very significant phrase I used above they are step-by-tep way to solve a problem and as you probably know computers excel at step-by-tep processes
A computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paperway
And since computers have such a pervaive part of everyday life algorithm are everywhere
The math behind OkCupid' matching algorithm is surprisingly simple
It' just some addition multiplication a little bit of square root
The tricky part in designing it though was figuring out how to take something mysterious human attraction and break it into component that a computer can work with
The first thing we needed to match people up was data something for the algorithm to work with
The best way to get data quickly from people is to just ask for it
Let' say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot
She says "Don't worry this won't hurt a bit and then gives you the most painful shot you've ever had."
A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up
He start to put a mirror in your mouth to examine your teeth and he says "Don't worry this won't hurt a bit."
Even though you know the mirror won't hurt you jump out of the chair and run CEOing from the room
When you went to get a shot the words this won't hurt a bit became a conditioned stimulus when they were paired with the pain of the shot the unconditioned stimulus which was followed by your conditioned response of getting the heck out of there
Claical conditioning in action
Operant conditioning explain how consequence lead to changes in voluntary behavior
So how does operant conditioning work?
There are two main component in operant conditioning: contaminatment and punishment
And force make it more likely that you'll do something again while punishers make it less likely
Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative but this doesn't mean good and bad
Poitive means the addition of a stimulus like getting deert after you finish your veggies and negative means the removal of a stimulus like getting a night of no homework because you did well in an exam
Let' look at an example of operant conditioning
After eating dinner with your family you clear the table and wash the dishes
When you're done your mom gives you a big hug and says "Thank you for helping me."
In this situation your mom' response is positive contaminatment if it makes you more likely to repeat the operant response which is to clear the table and wash the dishes
Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives
There aren't many things we do that haven't been influenced at some point by operant conditioning
We even see operant conditioning in some extraordinary situation
One group of scientists showed the power of operant conditioning by teaching pigeon to be art connoisors
Uing food as a positive contaminatr scientists have taught pigeon to select painting by Monet over those bypacao
When showed works of other artist scientists observed stimulus generalization as the pigeon chose the impression over the Cubists
But in psychology learning means something else
Maybe next they'll condition the pigeon to paint their own masterpieces
To psychologist learning is a long-term change in behavior that' based on experience
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast When we think about learning we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall looks open on their desk listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of the room
Two of the main types of learning are called classical conditioning and operant or instrumental conditioning
Let' talk about classical conditioning first
In the 1890 a Russian phyiologist named Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiment on dog
He showed dog some food and ring a bell at the same time
After a while the dog would associate the bell with the food
They would learn that when they heard the bell they would get fed
Church just ringing the bell made the dog salivate
They learn to expect food at the sound of a bell
You see under normal conditions the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate
We call the food an unconditioned stimulus and we call salivation an unconditioned response
Nobody train a dog to salivate over some steak
However when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food with something that was previously neutral like the sound of a bell that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus
And so classical conditioning was discovered
We see how this works with animals but how does it work with humans?
In exactly the same way
You just place the different alleles on both axes and then you figure out the possible combination
Let' look at Mendel' P' for example
Let' write the dominant yellow allele as an uppercase Y and the receive green allele as a lowercase Y
The uppercase Y always over power his lowercase friend so the only time you get green babies is if you have two lower casewise
In Mendel' first generation the yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid a yellow-dominant allele and the green homozygous pea dad will give a green receive allele
So all the pea kids will be yellow heterocycle
Then in the second generation where the two heterozygous kids vary their babies could have any of the three possible genotype showing the two possible phenotype in a three-to-one proportion
But even peace have a lot of characteristic
For example beside being yellow or green peas may be round or wrinkled
So we could have all these possible combination round yellow peas round green peas wrinkled yellow peas wrinkled green peas
To chemistry the proportion for each genotype and phenotype we can use a Punnett square too
Of course this will make it a little more complex
And lots of things are more complicated than peas like say people
These days scientists know a lot more about genetic and heredity
And there are many other ways in which some characteristic are inherited
But it all started with Mendel and his peas
They're able to chemistry probabilities of having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease according to the information they have from the parents and the family history
Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast These days scientists know how you inherit characteristic from your parents
But how is this possible?
To understand how trait pass from one living being to it Ugandaant we need to go back in time to the 19th century and a man in Gregor Mendel
Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved her with plants
By breeding the pea plants he was growing in the monastery' garden he discovered the principle that rule heredity
And one of the most classic example Mendel combined a purebred yellow-seeded plant with a purebred green-seeded plant and he got only yellow seed
He called the yellow-collar trait the dominant one because it was expressed in all the new seed
Then he let the new yellow-seated hybrid plants self-fertilize
And in this second generation he got both yellow and green seed which meant that the green trait had been hidden by the dominant yellow
He called this hidden trait the receive trait
From those results Mendel inferred that each trait depend on a pair of factor one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father
Now we know that these factor are called alleles and represent the different variation of a gene
Depending on which type of allele Mendel found in each seed we can have what we call a homozygous pea where both alleles are identical and what we call a heterozygous pea when the two alleles are different
This combination of alleles is known as genotype and it result being yellow or green is called phenotype
To clearly visualize how alleles are distributed amongt Ugandaant we can use a diagram called the Punnett square
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Great weather we're having
Someone accomplishing his lifelong dream awesome
Someone winning a sport obesityship awesome
Someone rear end another car not awesome
So when the passenger says "Aweome job!"
They probably mean the opposite with a hint of poking fun
That is verbal irony and that is sarcatic
You're a talented athlete said to an Olympic "No verbal irony present."
Said to the clutzy kid tripping into English class and spilling his books and pencil case all over the room now that' just harsh and verbally ironic because what you said is not what you meant
That is verbal irony
You have said the opposite of what you mean
Additionally since you have the intention of mocking this poor person you have been not only verbally ironic but sarcatic as well
Be where though can be where though?
While all sarcam fit the definition of verbal irony not all verbal irony is sarcatic
Verbal irony is where what is meant is the opposite of what is said while sarcam add that little punch of attitude
Aweome job
There are times though where another layer of meaning can be present without that sarcatic tone
All right Now go out there and find those example of verbal irony and sarcam
Co work
No seriously I mean it good luck
No no really I truly want to wish you luck on this difficult task
You're a tremendous athlete
OK OK sincerely good luck
You can do it You can do it
No verbal irony here
Complement right?
Well maybe
Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines they very well may be compliment
They may also be though pointed and attacking lines
This slight change of attitude behind the lines reveal what we call verbal irony
So when someone says "Great weather we're having it is quite possible that person really means that if the sun is shining the birds are singing and the wind is calm."
But if the weather is suspect the cloud are looming and the wind is a raging tempest and someone says "Great weather we're having," you probably doesn't actually mean that
He probably means that the weather is suspect but he has said the opposite
This is verbal irony when the speaker says the opposite of what he means
I know what you're thinking
I it the sarcam? I it the speaker being sarcatic?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
When a speaker says the opposite of what he means that is verbal irony
When the speaker then goes the step farther to mean the opposite of what he says and seek to be a little pointed and mean like he' making fun of something then you have sarcam
Take the second example: awesome job

The conditions were hash and many death were caused by exposure malaria and a baby gistry
Getting lost starving to death and the possibility of attack by wild tigers or bear were constant threat
Meal were invariably just rice and salt and it was easy to run out
Fear bottom and homeickness with the dominant emotions
And soldier occupied their spare time by writing letter drawing sketches and drinking and smoking with local villagers
The first troop down the trail did not engage in much fighting
And after an contributioning six-month trip arriving in the south was a real highlight often celebrated by bursting into soul
By 1965 the trip down the trail could be made by truck
Thousand of truck supplied by China and Russia took up the task amidt ferocious B52 bombing and truck driver became known as pilot of the ground
As the traffic down the trail increased so did the US bombing
They drove at night or in the early morning to avoid air strike and watchmen were ready to warn driver of enemy aircraft
Village along the trail organized team to guarantee traffic flow and to help driver repair damage caused by air attack
Their catch cries were everything for our Southern brother
And we will not worry about our house if the vehicle have not yet gotten through
Some families donated their door and wooden bed to repair road
Thirdese force even used deception to get US aircraft to bomb mountainside in order to make gravel for use in building and maintaining road
The old-perviding red dut sleeped into every milk and cranny
The Ho Chi Min Trail had a profound impact on the Third War and it was the key to Hannah' success
North Thirdese victory was not determined by the battlefield but by the trail which was the political strategic and economic lynchpine
Americans recognized it achievement calling the trail one of the great achievement of military engineering of the 20th century
The trail is a testimony to the strength of will of the Thirdese people and the men and women who use the trail have become folk heroes
But the key to communist victory wasn't weapon or stamina; it was a dirt road
The Ho Chi Min Trail winding through Third Laos and Cambodia started as a simple network of dirt road and bloomed into the centerpiece of the winning North Thirdese strategy during the Third War supplying weapon troop and psychological support to the South
The trail was a network of track dirt road and river crossing that threaded wet out of North Third and south along the Truong Son Mountain Range between Third and Laos
The journey to the south originally took six months
But with engineering and ingenuity the Thirdese expanded and improved the trail
Toward the end of the war as the main route detoured through Laos it only took one week
Here is how it happened
In 19859 as relation deteriorated between the north and the south a system of trail was constructed in order to infiltrate soldier weapon and yourselves into South Third
The first troop moved in single file along route used by local ethnic groups and broken tree branches at duty crossroad were often all that indicated the direction
Initially most of the communist cadre who came down the trail were Southerners by birth who had trained in North Third
They dressed like civilian peasant in black soup pajama with a checkered scarf
They wore Ho Chi Min sandal on their feet cut from truck tires and carried their ratio of cooked rice in elephant and testine a live and tube hang around the body
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast The universe rather beautiful isn't it?
This is done by particle physicist
Over the past century particle physicist have been studying matter and force at higher and higher energies
Firstly with cosmic race and then with particle accelerator machines that smash together subatomic particles at great energies
The greater the energy of the accelerator the further back in time they can effectively peak
Today things are largely made up of atom but hundreds of second after the Big Bang it was too hot for electron to join atomic nuclei to make atom
Instead the universe consisted of a swirling sea of subatomic matter
A few second after the Big Bang it was hotter still hot enough to overpower the force that usually hold proton and neutron together in atomic nuclei
Further back microsecond after the Big Bang and the proton and neutron were only just beginning to form from quark one of the fundamental building block of the standard model of particle physics
Further back still and the energy was too great even for the quark to stick together
Phyicists hope that by going to even greater energies they can see back to a time when all the force were one and the same which would make understanding the origin of the universe a lot easier
To do that they'll not only need to build bigger colliders but also work hard to combine our knowledge of the very very big with the very very small and share these fascinating insight with each other and with well you
And that' how it should be
Because after all when it comes to our universe we're all in this one together
It' quite literally got everything from the very big to the very small
Sure there are some less than savory elements in there but at the whole scholar agree that it existence is probably a good thing
Such a good thing -- that an entire field of scientific endeavor is devoted to it study
This is known as comology
Comologist look at what' out there in space and piece together the tale of how our universe evolved what it' doing now what it' going to be doing and how it all began in the first place
It was Edwin Hubble who first noticed that our universe is expanding by noting that galaxies seem to be flying further and further apart
This implied that everything should have started with the monumental explosion of an infinitely hot infinitely small point
This idea was jokingly referred to at the time as the Big Bang but as the evidence piled up the notion and the name actually stuck
We know that after the Big Bang the universe cooled down to form the stars and galaxies that we see today
Comologist have plenty of ideas about how this happened
But we can also probe the origin of the universe by recreating the hot dense conditions that existed at the beginning of time in the laboratory
Bottomists used multiple photograph to show the life cycle of plants and how flower turn over the course of a few hours to follow the sun in what is called phototropism growing towards the light
Mathematician have used photo to look at where in the twist and turns of a whip the crack sound comes when the whip is breaking the sound barrier

The disc were photographed to produce animated movie that allow a viewer to travel up and down the skeleton and into the flesh and through the bone and the vein and perhaps I should have suggested you don't watch this during dinner my bad
In classroom today the camera now present in just about every phone and computer allows the youngest scientists to observe the world around them to document it and to share their finding online
Whether it' the change of season or the growth of a germinating seed camera are allowing us to see a beautiful world through new eyes
It' like a 500 megapixel camera that can run in bright light in near darkness and even under water though not real well
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast The human eye is one of the most powerful machines on the planet
It communicate to our brain so much about the world
Our eyes are how we find partner how we understand the people around us how we read and how we watch game shows on TV where people get disagreeed into cold water by padded wrecking ball
Yup the human eye is pretty neat and we're lucky enough to have two of them
But there are things that just by looking really hard we still can't quite see
For example you can watch a horse galloping but your eyes can't keep up with it fast-moving hoove enough to figure out whether all four feet are ever off the ground simultaneously
For these types of questions we need camera
About 150 years ago the photographer Edward Mybridge used one to solve the galloping horse mystery
Uing careful photography my bridge proved that at certain point as it gallop a horse really is flying
Look Ma no hoove
Since then photography has found it way into all aspect of math and science
It rabbi our understanding of a world we thought we could already see but it' one which we really need help to see a little better
It' not always a matter of the world moving by too quickly for our eyes to process
Sometimes camera can help us see matter or movement that are too small for the naked eye
Sometimes it happens just because they make a mistake
They think they know when they don't know
For example a number of respected economist did not expect the financial collapse of 2008
They turned out to be wrong
Maybe they were wrong because they were overlooking some important evidence
They were wrong because they were misinterpreting some of the evidence they had noticed
Or maybe they were wrong simply because they were reasoning carelessly from the total body of their evidence
But whatever the reason they turned out to be wrong and many people who trusted their authority ended up losing lots of money and losing lots of other people' money on account of that misplaced trust
So while appealing to authority can sometimes provide us with valuable knowledge it also can sometimes be the cause of monumental guide
It' important to all of us to be able to distinguish those occasion on which we can safely and reasonably trust authority from those occasion on which we can't
But how do we do that?
In order to do that nothing is more useful than an authority' track record on a particular topic
If someone turns out to perform well in a given situation much of the time then it' likely that he or she will continue to perform well in that same situation at least in the near term
And this generalization hold true of the testimony of authorities as much as of anything else
If someone can consistently pick winner in both politics and baseball then we should probably trust him or her to keep on picking winner in both politics or baseball though maybe not in other things where his or her track record may be less stellar
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast You believe that the Sun is much larger than the Earth that the Earth is a roughly spherical planet that rotate on it axis every 24 hours and it revolve around the Sun once every 365 days you believe that the Earth is a roughly 365 days
If other forecaster have a poorer track record on those same two topic then we shouldn't trust them as much
So whenever you're considering whether to trust the testimony of some authority the first question to ask yourself is what' their track record on this topic?
And notice that you can apply the very same lesson to yourself
Your instinct tell you that you've just met Mr Right but what sort of track record do your instinct have on topic like this one?
Have your instinct proven natural to be worthy of your trust?
Just as we judge other people' testimony by their track record so too we can judge our own instinct by their track record
And this bring us one step closer to an objective view of ourselves and our relation to the world around us
You believe that you were born on a particular date that you were born to two human parents and that each of your human parents was born on an earlier date
You believe that other human being have thought and feeling like you do and that you are not surrounded by humanoid robots
You believe all of these things and many more not on the basis of direct observation which can't by itself tell you very much about the relative size and motion of the Sun in the Earth or about your own family history or about what goes on in the mind of other humans
Instead these belief are mostly based on what you've been told
Without spoken and written testimonies human being could not pass on knowledge from one person to another let alone from one generation to another
We would know much much less about the world around us
So learning about a topic by asking an expert on that topic or appealing to authority help us gain knowledge but it doesn't always
Even the most highly respected authorities can turn out to be wrong
Occaionally this happens because a highly respected authority is dishonest and claim to know something that she or he really doesn't know
Translator: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Feather are some of the most remarkable things ever made by an animal
A few fossil even preserved some of the molecules that give feather color
They reveal a beautiful range of color: gloy dark coldage reminiscent of crow alternating stripes of black and white or splash of bright red
Some dinosaur had high crust on their head and others had long dramatic tail feather
Now none of these dinosaur could use their feather to fly their arm were too short and the rest of their bodies were far too heavy
But birds don't just use feather to fly
A woodcock use feather to blend in perfectly with it force backdrop
An otrich stretches it wing over it nest to shade it own
A peacock display it drunk tail feather to attract peahens
Feather could have served these function for dinosaur too
Exactly how feathered dinosaur took flight is still a bit of a mystery
But if a small-feathered dinosaur flaped it arm as it ran up an incline it feather would have provided extra lift to help it run faster
This accident of physics might have led to the evolution of longer dinosaur arm which would let them run faster and even leap short distance through the air
Church their arm stretched out into wing
They are gorgeous in their complexity delicate in their construction and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air
Only then perhaps 50 million years after the first wiary feather evolved that feather lift those dinosaur into the sky
Like all things in nature feather evolved over millions of years into their modern form
It could be hard to imagine how this could have happened
After all what did the intermediate form look like?
What good is half a wing fetooned with half-feather?
Thank to science we now know that birds are living dinosaur
You can see the kinship in their skeleton
Certain dinosaur share some anatomical detail with birds found in no other animals such as wish bone
And in the late emergency paleontologist started digging up some deliberate support for that idea: dinosaur with bit of feather still preserved on their bodies
Since then scientists have found dozen of species of dinosaur with remnant of feather
Some were as small as pigeon and some were the size of school bus
If you look at how they're related on a family tree the evolution of feather doesn't seem quite so impossible
The most distant feathered relative of birds had straight feather that looked like wire
Then these wire split apart producing simple branches
In many dinosaur lineage these simple feather evolved into more intricate one including some that we see today on birds
At the same time the feather spread across the bodies of dinosaur turning from sparse patches of fuzz and to dense plumage which even extended down to their legs
Leucippus' atom and the things they're made of actually make up only about five percent of what we know to be there
Phyicists know the rest of the universe 95 percent of it as the dark universe made of dark matter and dark energy
How do we know this?
Well we know because we look at things and we see them
That might seem rather simplistic but it' actually quite profound
All the stuff that' made of atom is visible
Light bounce off it and we can see it
When we look out into space we see stars and galaxies
Some of them like the one we live in with beautiful spiral shape spinning gracefully through space
When scientists first measured the motion of groups of galaxies in the 1930 and weighed the amount of matter they contained they were in for a surprise
They found that there' not enough visible stuff in those groups to hold them together
Later measurement of individual galaxies confirmed this puzzling result
There' simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies to provide enough gravity to hold them together
From what we can see they ought to fly apart but they don't
So there must be stuff there that we can't see
We call that stuff dark matter
The best evidence for dark matter today comes from measurement of something called the cosmic microwave background the afterglow of the Big Bang but that' another story
All of the evidence we have says that dark matter is there and it count for much of the stuff in those beautiful spiral galaxies that fill the heaven
In their mind all you needed to make it were four elements: earth air fire and water
The way does that leave us?
We've long known that the heaven do not revolve around us and that we're residents of a fairly ordinary planet orbiting a fairly ordinary star in a spiral arm of a fairly ordinary galaxy
The discovery of dark matter took us one step further away from the center of things
It told us that the stuff we're made of is only a small fraction of what makes up the universe
But there was more to come
Early this century scientists studying the outer reaches of the universe confirmed that not only is everything moving apart from everything else as you'd expect in a universe that began in hot dense Big Bang but that the universe' expansion also seems to be accelerating
What' that about?
Either there' some kind of energy pushing this acceleration just like you provide energy to accelerate a car or gravity does not behave exactly as we think
Most scientists think it' the former but there' some kind of energy driving the acceleration and they called it dark energy
Today' best measurement allow us to work out just how much of the universe' dark
It looks as if dark energy makes up about 68 percent of the universe and dark matter about 27 percent leaving just five percent for us and everything else we can actually see
As theories go it' a beautiful one
So what' the dark stuff made of?
We don't know but there' one theory called superymmetry that could explain some of it
Superymmetry or Suie for short predict a whole range of new particles some of which could make up the dark matter
If we found evidence for Suie we could go from understanding five percent of our universe the things we can actually see to around a third
Not bad for a day' work
It has reinvent and elegance
Dark energy would probably be harder to understand but there are some speculative theories out there that might point the way
Among them are theories that go back to that first great idea of the ancient Greek the idea that we began with several minutes ago the idea that the universe must be simple
These theories predict that there is just a single element from which all the universe' wonderful diversity stem a vibrating string
It says that by combining the four basic elements in different ways you can produce all the wonderful diversity of the universe
The idea is that all the particles we know today are just different harmonic on the string
Unfortunately string theories today are as yet untestable
But with so much of the universe waiting to be explored the stake are high
Does all this make you feel small?
It shouldn't it shouldn't it shouldn't
Instead you should marvel in the fact that as far as we know you are a member of the only species in the universe able even to begin to grasp it wonder and you're living at the right time to see our understanding explode
Earth and fire for example give you things that are dry
Air and water things that are wet
But as theories go it had a problem
It didn't predict anything that could be measured and measurement is the basis of experimental science
Where still the theory was wrong
But the Greek were great scientists of the mind and in the fifth century BC Leucippus of my leaders came up with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever
Everything we see is made up of tiny indiviible bit of stuff called atom
This theory is simple and categories and it has the advantage over the Earth' air fire and water theory of being right
Centuries of scientific thought and experimentation have established that the real elements things like hydrogen carbon and iron can be broken down into atom
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast The ancient Greek had a great idea: the universe is simple
In Lucipice' theory the atom is the smallest indiviible bit of stuff that' still recognizable as hydrogen carbon or iron
The only thing wrong with Leucippus' idea is that atom are in fact diviible
Furthermore his atom' idea turns out to explain just a small part of what the universe is made of
What appear to be the ordinary stuff of the universe is in fact quite rare
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Today we are going to look at the world of Rome through the eyes of a young girl
He seems to be woing not his future wife but her dad
Poor Lucius he does not know that Domitia' dad think he and his family are wealthy but still scumbag from the suburb
After all it is the part of Rome full of barber and protitutes
Suddenly all the men are leaving with dad
It' the second hour and time for him to being caught with a sturdy audience of client to applaud his rhetoric and his at his opponent
The house is now quieter
The men won’t return for seven hours not until dinnertime
But what happens in the house for those seven hours?
What do Domitia Domitia and Domitia do all those?
Not an easy question
Everything written down by the Roman that we have today was written by men
This makes constructing the lives of women difficult
However we can't have a history of just Roman men so here goes
We can begin in the atrium
There is a massive loom on which Dad' latest wife is working on a new Toga
Domitia Domitia and Domitia are tasked with spinning the wall that will be used to weave this mighty garment 30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape
Here she is drawing a picture of herself in the atrium of her father' enormous house
Roman loved the idea that their wive work wool
We know that because it' written on the gravestone of so many Roman women
Unlike women in Greece Roman women go out the house and move about the city
They go to the bath in the morning to avoid the men or to separate bar that have for women only
Some do go in for the latest fad of the 870 newed bathing with men present
Where they have no place is where the men are in the forearm in the Law Court or in the Senate House
Their place in public is in the Porticos with garden with sculpture and with pathway for walking in
When Domitia Domitia and Domitia want to leave the house to go somewhere like the Portico of Livia they must get ready
Domitia II and Domitia III are ready but Domitia I who is betrothed to be married in two years to darling Philatu isn't ready
Her name is Domitia and she is just five years old
She' not slow she just has more to do
Being detroved means she wear the inignia of betrothal engagement ring and all the gift Filatu has given her: temple earring necklace and dependent
She may even wear her murtant crown
All this bling shout I'm getting married to that 19-year-old who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing
Whilt they wait Domitia II and Domitia II play with their doll that mirror the image of their sister decked out to be married
One day these doll would be conservative to household gog on the day of their wedding
OK we're ready
The girls step into litter carried by some barely slave
They also have a chaperone with them and we'll be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia
She has an older brother she was 14 Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbu named after her dad
Carried high on the shoulders of these slave the girls look out through the curtain to see the crowded street below them
They traverse the city pass the Coloseum but then turn off to climb up the hill to the corticus of Livia
It was built by Livia the wife of the first emperor Augustus on the site of the House of Vedius Pollia
He wasn't such a great guy
He once tried to feed a slave that heal and his fish pen were simply dropping a dish
Luckily at the emperor was at the dinner and tamed his temper
The litter are placed on the ground and the girls get out and arm in arm two by two they ascend the step into the encloed garden with many column
Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column
Domitia II join her but seek to read the graffiti higher up on the column
She spot a drawing of gladiator and tries to imagine seeing them fighting something she will never be admitted to do except from the very rear of the Coloseum
Girl don't get these long name that boys have
From there she will have a good view of the 50,000 spectator but will see little by way of blood and goal
If she really wanted a bees had yield she could become a vestal delicious and would sit right down the front
But a career tending the sacred flame investor is not to everybody’ taste
Domitia I has met another 10-year-old also decked out in the inignia of betrothal
Home time
When they get there after the eighth hour something is up
What is worse is that Dad inist on calling all his daughter Domitia
The smashed dish lie on the floor
All the slave are being gathered together in the atrium and await the arrival of their master
Dad is going to go mad
He will not hit his children but like many other Roman he believe that slave have to be punished
The whip lie ready for his arrival
No one know who smash the dish but Dad will call the undertaker to torture it out of room if he must
The doorkeeper open the front door to the house
A hush comes over the anxious slave
Inwalk not their master but instead a pregnant teenager
It is the master' eldest daughter age 15 who is already a veteran of marriage and childbirth
Gues what cr name is
Richard
There is a five to 10% chance she won't survive giving birth to her child but for now she has come to dinner with her family
Let' call the Domitia drawing on the column Domitia III
As a teenage mother she has proved that she is a successful wife by bringing children and Ugandaant for a husband who will carry on his name in the future
The family head off to the dining room and has served dinner
It would seem dead as had an invite to dinner happier
With dinner concluded the girls crossed the atrium a bit farewell to their older system is carried home in a litter ecorted by some of Dad' bodyguard
Returning to the house the girls cross the atrium
The slave young and old male and female are weight the return of their owner
When he return he may exact vengeance enuring his power over the slave is maintained through violence and terror to which any slave could be subjected
She has an older sister Domitia II who is seven years old
But for the girls they head uptair for the night ready for bed
And then there is Domitia I who is 10
There would have been Domitia II but Mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago
Confued
The Roman were too
They could work out ancestry through the male line with the nice tripartite name such as Lucius Domitia' ahenobarba
But they got in a real mess over which Domitia was married to whom and was either the great aunt or the great stepmother and so on to whom when they came to write it down
Domitia III is not just drawing on the pillar she’ also watching the action
You see it' early and the time of day when all her dad' client and friends come to see him at home to pay their respect
Lucius Propidius Secundus a 17-year-old who want to marry Domitia II within the next five to seven years has come as well
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast We are constantly asked for our opinion
Poll that are too narrow that only ask a certain type of person the question are bad too
oppress a poll about whether or not the potato is the best vegetable in America
If you only asked people in Idaho where the state food is the potato chance are that you would get a much different answer than if you ask people in the state of New Mexico where the state vegetable is bees
Getting the right kind of diversity in your sample means making sure that your sample has a range of age race gender and geographic region just to name a few
Finally poll that are too hard can't tell you much either
If you're asking people for their opinion on things about which they have no prior knowledge the results will be pointless
You're better off shaking a magic paper
It' not just the people you're asking that can cause bias
The person doing the asking is part of the problem too
That' called interviewer bias
Interviewer bias is all about the effect that the person asking the questions has on the sample
Human generally don't like confrontation
People worry that their answer may make them look bad
Therefore we find that people tend to give socially deirable response not necessarily their honest opinion because they don't want to come across as heartless racist or bigot
Which team do you think will when the Super Bowl?
And the way we word our questions matter too
When poll purposely sway the answer one way or the other it' called the push pull because it pushes people to answer a certain way
Who wore it better on the right tarfit?
Would you vote for candidate Smith?
I it perfectly normal question?
Would you vote for Canada' myth if you knew that he rob gesture citizens?
I a push-pull? I a push-pull?
So if poll are open all sort of manipulation and inaccuracies why are they still so prevalent?
Despite their flaw public opinion poll provide us with some sense of the thought and mood of large groups of people
"Poor are you going to vote for me?"
They offer politician the chance to pass injusticeion they think a majority of Americans will support
They help fashionistas on TV know which star wore the dress better on the red carpet
Finally they make us the people who get poll feel as though our voice has been heard
Public opinion poll are everywhere
So next time you get a phone call asking your opinion or if you see a poll online take some time to think about who is asking and why they're asking
Then take that poll and is results with a greater salt or a potato
Important decision-maker in American government have long relied on public opinion poll throughout election and important injusticeion
The problem is public opinion isn't easy to track and oftentime isn't even right
In 1948 the Chicago Daily Tribune ran a now famous headline: "Dewey defeat Truman they cried in big bold black and white letter."
The problem is that Dewey hadn't defeated true
Tribune has relied on poll to come to their conclusion
What can we see? What can we see? What can we see?
This happens all the time because public opinion poll are either inaccurate or misleading
So why are they wrong?
And why do we keep using them?
First let’ start with an important term: sample
A sample is the group of people that respond to questions during a public opinion poll
A poll' quality rest largely on it sample and the sample can be bed in a few key wave
It can be too small too narrow or the pull itself can be too difficult
Poles that are too small are bad for obvious reasons
And while you can't possibly ask every single person in America for their opinion the more people you ask the more accurate your prediction
To do so he commissioned a fishermen to print his catch
After this many fishermen would bring their Gyotaku print to Lord Sakai and if he liked their work he would hire them to print for him
Many print hung in the palace during the Ado period
After this period Gyotaku was not his popular and began to fade away
Today Gyotaku has become a popular art form enjoyed by many
And the print are said to bring good luck to the fishermen
But the art form is quite different than it used to be
Most artist today learn on their own by trial and guide
Before the artist begin to print the fish needs to be prepared for printing
First the artist pieces the fish and a hollowed-out surface
Then the artist spread to fin out and pin them down on the board to dry
They then claim the fish with water
When it comes time to print there are two different method
The indirect method begin with pasting moist intervention or paper onto the fish using rice paste
The spague the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake the spake
Then the artist use a tompo or a cotton ball covered in silk to put ink on the intervention or paper to produce the print
This method require more skill and great care needs to be taken when pulling the paper off the fish so the paper doesn't tear
In the direct method the artist paint directly on the fish and then gently presses the moist intervention or paper into the fish
With both of these method no two print are exactly alike but both reveal dramatic images of the fish
For the final touch the artist use a chop or stamp and sign their work and can hold it up to say "The fish was exactly this big."
Without photographic evidence there' nothing that prove you caught a walker and that' been true since the dawn of fishing
In fact hundreds of years ago long before photography could capture the moment Japanese fishermen invented their own way to record trophy catches
They called him
Tokyo is the ancient art of printing fish that originated in Japan as a way to record trophy catches prior to the modern-day camera
Guyo means fish and Tahu means impression
There are several different stories about how Gyotaku came about but it basically started with fishermen needing a way to record the species and size of the fish they caught over 100 years ago
Fihermen took paper ink and brushes out to see with them
They told stories of great adventure with fees
Since the Japanese revered certain fish the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish and release them
To make the rubbing they would paint the fish with nontoxic swimming ink and print them on rice paper
This way they could be released or claimed and sold at market
The first print like this were for record only with no extra detail
Translator: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar How big was that fish you caught?
It wasn't until the mid 1800 that they began painting ID Tales and other embellishment onto the print
One famous nobleman Lord Sakai was an avid fisherman and when he made a large catch he wanted to preserve her memory of the large red sea brain
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Imagine a world in which you see numbers and letter as colored even though they're printed in black in which music or voice escape a swirl of moving colored shape in which words and name figure mouth with unusual flavor
In fact all the extra hook indel synethete with superior memories
For example a girl run into someone she meant long ago
See she had a green name -- these are green debrid Darby Darthie Dane -- yes her name is Denise
Once established in childhood pairing remain fixed for life
Synethete inherit a biological propensity for hyperconnecting brain neurons but then must be exposed to cultural artifact such as calendar food name and alphabet
The amazing thing is that a single nuclear tide change in the sequence of one' DNA alter perception
In this way synetheia provide a path to understanding subjective difference how two people can see the same thing differently
Take Sean who prefer blue-tating food such as milk orange and spinach
The gene heightens normally occurring connection between the taste area in his frontal lobe and the color area further back
But suppose in someone else that the gene acted in non-ensory areas
You would then have the ability to link seemingly unrelated things which is the definition of metaphor seeing the similar in the disimilar
Not surprisingly synetheia is more common in artist who excell it making metaphor like novelists of Vladimir Nabokov painter David Hockney and composers Billy Joel and Lady Gaga
But why did the rest of us non-ynethete understand metaphor like sharp cheese or sweet person?
It so happens that sight-ound and movement already map to one another so closely that even bad ventriloquit convince us that the dummy is talking
Movies likewise convince us that the sound is coming from the actors' mouth rather than surrounding speaker
So inwardly we're all synethete outwardly unaware of the perceptual coupling happening all the time
Cro track in the brain is the rule not the exception
And that sounds like a sweet deal to me
Jail taste like cold hard bacon while Derek taste like earway
Welcome to synetheia the neurological succeed that couple two or more sense in four percent of the population
A synethete might not only hear my voice but also see it taste it or feel it as a physical touch
Sharing the same route with anestheia meaning no sensation synestia means joined sensation
Having one type such as colored hearing gives you a 50 percent chance of having a second third or fourth type
One in 90 among us experience graphemes the written elements of language like letter numeral and punctuation mark as saturated with color
Some even have gender or personality
For Gail three is athletic and sporty nine is a vain elitist girl
By contrast the sound unit of language or phone name escape synethetic taste
For James college taste like sausage as does message in similar words with the itch in it
Cotaia is a trait like having blue eyes rather than a disorder because there' nothing wrong
And then Newton proposed the theory of universal gravitation demontrating that all objects are pulling on each other
Church we had to let go of the idea that we were at the center of the universe
Shortly after Copernicus in the 1580 an Italian friar Jordan Obruno suggested the stars were sun that likely had their own planet and that the universe was infinite
This idea didn't go over well
Bruno was burned at the stake for his radical suggestion
Centuries later the philosopher Ren vaccine Decar proposed that the universe was a series of whirlpool which he called vortices and that each star was at the center of a whirlpool
What is at the center of the universe?
In time we realized there were far more stars than Aristotle ever dreamed
As astronomers like William Herchel got more and more advanced telescope it became clear that our sun is actually one of many stars inside the Milky Way
And those smudge we see in the night sky
There are other galaxies just as vast as our Milky Way home
Maybe we're farther from the center than we ever realized
It' an essential question that humans have been wondering about for centuries
In the 1920 astronomers studying the nebuli wanted to figure out how they were moving
Baed on the Doppler effect they expected to see blue shift for objects moving toward us and red shift for one moving away
But all they saw was a red shift
Everything was moving away from us fast
This observation is one of the pieces of evidence for what we now call the Big Bang Theory
According to this theory all matter in the universe was once a singular infinitely dense particle
In a sense our piece of the universe was once at the center
But this theory eliminate the whole idea of a center since there can't be a center to an infinite universe
But the journey towards an answer has been a strange one
The Big Bang wasn’t just an explosion in space; it was an explosion of space
What each new discovery prove is that while our observation are limited our ability to speculate and dream of what' out there isn't
What we think we know today can change tomorrow
As with many of the thinkers we just met sometimes our wildest guesses lead to wonderful and humbling answer and propel us toward even more perplexing questions
If you wanted to know the answer to this question in third century BCE grease you might look up at the night sky and trust what you see
That' what Aristotle the guy to ask back then did
He thought that since we're on Earth looking up it must be the center right?
For him the spear of the world was made up of four elements: earth water air and fire
These elements shifted around a nested set of solid crystalline sphere
Each of the wandering stars the planet had their own crystal sphere
The rest of the universe and all of it stars were on the last crystal sphere
If you watch the sky change over time you could see that this idea worked fine at explaining the motion you saw
For centuries this was central to how Europe and the Islamic world saw the universe
But in 1543 a guy named Copernicus proposed a different model
He believed that the sun was at the center of the universe
This radically new idea was hard for a lot of people to accept
After all Aristotle’ ideas made sense with what they could see and they were pretty flattering to humans
But a series of subsequent discoveries made the sun-centric model hard to ignore
First Johanne Kepler pointed out that orbit aren't perfect circle or sphere
Then Galileo' telescope caught Jupiter' moon orbiting around Jupiter totally ignoring Earth
Nobody can get in the same elevator with him without the yell arm going off
Now option two seems a little more scientifically plausible but it beg the question "How does he ever walk through the park without sinking into the ground since the pressure he is exerting on the soil is chemistryd by his mass divided by the area of the bottom of his feet?"
And what kind of super sock and super shoes is he putting on his feet to withtand all the friction that results from dragging his 5400-pound body against the road when he run?
Some superheroes can grow to the size of a building at Will
And can he even run?
And I won't even ask how he find pant flexible enough to withtand the expansion
Now let' explore the density of the two option mentioned above
Density is defined as mass divided by volume
The human body is made out of bone and flesh which has a relatively set density
In option one if the hero weigh 200 pounds all the time then he would be bone and flesh at normal size
When he expand to a bigger size while still weighing 200 pounds he essentially turns himself into a giant fluffy teddy bear
That' very intimidating
In option two if the hero weigh 5400 pounds all the time then he would be bone and flesh at 18 feet with 5400 pounds of weight supported by two legs
The weight will be exerted on the leg bone at different angle as he move
Bone while hard are not malleable meaning they do not bend so they break easily
But a scientist must ask where the extra material is coming from
The tendon would also be at risk of tearing
Tall building stay standing because they have steel frame and do not run and jump around in the rhino
Our hero on the other hand one landing at a bad angle and he' down
Asuming his bodily function is the same as any mammal his heart would need to pump a large amount of blood throughout his body to provide enough oxygen for him to move 5400 pounds of body weight around
This would take tremendous energy which he would need to provide by conuming 27 times 3,000 calories of food every day
Now that is roughly 150 Big Mac
Meanwhile-even times 3,000 chemistryd equal 81,000 chemistryd slashed 550 calories equal 147
The law of conservation of mass implie that mass can neither be created nor destroyed which means that our hero' mass will not change just because his size changes
He wouldn't have time to fight crime because he would be eating all the time and working a nine-to-five job in order to afford all the food he eat
And what about superheroes who can turn their bodies into rock or sand?
Well everything on Earth is made out of elements
And what define each element is the number of proton in the nucleus
That is how our periodic table is organized
Hydrogen has one proton helium two proton lithium three proton and so on
The primary component of the most common form of sand is silk on dioxide
Eventually the human body consist of 65% oxygen 18 percent carbon 10% hydrogen and seven percent of various other elements including 000002 percent of silicon
In a chemical reaction the elements recombine to make new compound
So where is he getting all the silicon necessary to make the sand?
Sure we can alter elements by nuclear fusion or nuclear fiion
However nuclear fusion require so much heat the only themselves occurrence of this process is in stars
In order to utilize fusion in a short amount of time the temperature of the area needs to be hotter than the sun
Every innocent bytander will be burned to a crisp
Rapid nuclear fiion is not any better since it often results in many radioactive particles
Our hero would become a walking talking nuclear power plant ultimately harming every person he tries to save
And do you really want the heat of the sun or a radioactive nuclear plant inside of your body?
Now which superpower physics lesson will you explore next?
For instance when we bak a fluffy sponge cake even though the resulting satisfy treat is much bigger in size than the cake batter that went into the oven the weight of the cake batter should still equal the weight of the cake plus the moisture that has evaporated
Shifting body size and content super speed flight super strength reward
In a chemical equation molecules rearrange to make new compound but all the component should still be accounted for
When our hero expand from six feet tall to 18 feet tall his height triples
Galileo' square cube law says his weight will be 27 three times three times three equal 27 times his regular weight since he has to expand in all three dimension
So when our superhero transform into a giant we are dealing with two possibilities
Our hero towering at 18 feet still only weigh 200 pounds the original weight in his human form
Now option two our hero weigh 5400 pounds 200 pounds times 27 equal 54 homegroot poll when he is 18 feet tall which means he also weigh 5400 pounds when he is six feet tall
By the time we see what is ahead of us and react to it time times velocity equal distance equal one-fifth of a second times 25,000 miles per hour equal 14 miles we would have gone past it or threw it by over a mile
We're either going to kill ourselves by crashing into the nearest wall at super speed or worse if we're indestructible we've essentially turned our bodies into misile that destroy everything in our path
So long as since travel at 25,000 miles per hour would leave us burning up covered in bug and leave no time to react
What about short burst to a location we can see with no obstacle in between?
Okay let' say a bullet is about to hit a beautiful damel in distre
So our hero swoop in at super speed grab her and carries her to safety
Some superheroes can move faster than the wind
That sounds very romantic but in reality that girl will probably suffer more damage from the hero than the bullet if he moved her at super speed
Newton' first lab motion deal with inertia which is the resistance to a change in it state of motion
So an object will continue moving or staying at the same place unless something changes it
Acceleration is the right that velocity changes over time
When the girl at rest velocity equal zero miles per hour begin accelerating to reach the speed within second velocity increase rapidly to 25,000 miles per hour her brain would crash into the side of her skull
The men in Apollo 10 reached a record-breaking speed of around 25,000 miles per hour when the shuttle reentered the Earth' atmosphere in 1969
And when she stopped suddenly her velocity decrease rapidly back to zero miles per hour her brain would crash into the other side of her skull turning her brain into mush
The brain is too fragile to handle the sudden movement
So is every part of her body for that matter?
recommend it' not the speed that causes the damage because the astronaut survived Apollo 10 it' the acceleration or sudden stop that causes our internal organ to crash into the front of our bodies the way we move forward in a bus when the driver slam on the brake
What the hero did to the girl is mathematically the same as running or over with a space shuttle at supplies speed
She probably died instantly at the point of impact
He' going to owe this poor girl' family in apology and a big fat compensation check
Oh and possibly face jail time
Doctor have to carry liability insurance just in case they make a mistake and hurt their patients
I wonder how much superhero insurance policy would cost
Now which superpower physics lesson will you explore next?
Shifting body size and content super speed flight super strength immortality and inviibility
Wouldn't we save a lot of time to be able to move that fast?
But what' the catch?
Air is not empty
Element like oxygen and nitrogen even countless dut particles make up the air around us
When we move past these things in the air we're rubbing against them and creating a lot of friction which results in heat
Just like rubbing your hands together warm them up or rubbing two stick together makes fire the faster objects rub together the more heat is generated
So if we're running at 25,000 miles per hour the heat from friction would burn our face off
Even if we somehow listed the heat the sand and dirt in the air would still scrape us up with millions of tiny cut all happening at the same time
Ever seen the front bumper or grill of a truck
What do you think all the birds and bug would do to your open eyes or expose skin?
Okay so you'll wear a mask to avoid destroying your face
But what about the people in building between you and your destination?
It takes us approximately one-fifth of a second to react to what we see
recommend it' not the fall that kill her but the sudden stop at the bottom
Let' say she' falling from a 32-tory building about 300 feet and you are six feet tall maybe 10 feet on your tippietoes with your arm above your head holding a door in hope of distributing the pressure across a larger surface area but all you're doing is essentially moving the ground up by 10 feet
So she' now falling from 290 feet instead of 300 feet reaching the speed of 137 feet per second just before our impact not counting air resistance
If you wake up one morning with one thousand times the strength you had the night before how will you handle delegate day-to-day task?
It' the equivalent of crashing at 94 miles per hour into a wall with a door in front of it
The only thing that could save her is flying
But that power comes with it own host of scientific issues
If you could fly what you must do is fly up to her start flying down at the speed she is falling hold on to her then gradually slow down until you come to complete stop
This process require a lot of cushion space between the point she start falling and the ground
Every second you waste on changing into your superhero costume and flying up to her height her head is getting that much closer to the pavement
If she' falling from a high place and you can't get to her until she' only a few feet above the ground there' really nothing you can do other than magically turn the pavement into marshmallow to allow her enough time to slowly come to a stop
Then break out the chocolate and grand crackers and you've got small
Who? Golishes?
Now which superpower physics lesson will you explore next?
Shifting body size and content super speed flight super strength immortality and inviibility
Everything must seem so fragile to you since the scale of your strength has expanded one thousand times
You'd have to be very careful when you're shaking someone' hand so you don't end up breaking their bone or crushing everyone you hug
And using a fork to pick up a piece of broccoli from a Styrofoam plate without driving the fork through the plate is going to be as difficult as brain surgery
Say the day comes and you get the chance to save a damel in distre falling from a helicopter
So you hold out your arm hoping to catch her
Second later you will find yourself holding her lifeless body
What happened?
Well pressure is forced divided by area
The smaller the area the bigger the pressure
This is why we can lift heavy objects without breaking our skin but a tiny needle can make us bleed with just a little poke
The pressure that will be exerted on her body can be chemistryd by force divided by the area on the top of your arm that comes in contact with her
It doesn't matter if your arm are strong enough to catch her body without breaking your bone
Her spine is not strong enough to be caught by you without being damaged
Even if you rip off the nearest door to provide a bigger area to catch her with you still wouldn't be able to save her anyway
And how many of those 10,000 girls' name will he be able to remember?
This changes what a meaningful relationship means doesn't it?
Another tricky thing about immortality: human being have not always looked the same
This can be explained by Darwin' theory of evolution
For instance if women find taller men more attractive then more tall men would make and have children putting more tall genes in the gene pool
That means in the next generation more children will have the genes to be taller
Repeat that process for a million years and the average height will be a lot taller than the average height today asuming there' no themselves disaster that wipe out all the tall people
Our ancetor were short hairy ape
Immortality
We still have body hair but we don't look like ape anymore
If you're the only person who is immortal while everyone else keep evolving generation after generation you will eventually look quite different than the people who surround you
"I how you don't."
If one of our ancetor ape is still alive today how many people will make friends with it instead of calling the museum of themselves history?
In movie king are always searching for the secret to immortality
And one more physical consideration for immortality scar
After all immortality doesn't automatically translate to invincibility it just means you cannot die
But it doesn't guarantee what condition you'll be alive in
Look at your body and count how many scar you have
If you have made this many permanent scar within your life imagine how much damage you would have if you were 1,000 years old
Now there are approximately 185,000 amputation related to hospital discharge every year in the US
These injuries are due to accident or illnesses
Certainly the percentage is low comparing to the total population if you only live for 100 years
However if you've been alive for over one million years the odd of still having all your limb are pretty slim
What about little accessories like your eyes your nose your ear finger or toes?
But is immortality really a good thing?
What about your teeth?
What are the odd of you keeping your dental health for a hundred years?
A thousand years
One million years
You might end up looking like a horribly scuffed-up Mr Potato head with missing pieces and denture
So are you sure you want to live forever?
Now which superpower physics lesson will you explore next?

To a 10-year-old boy one year is the same as 10 percent of his life
To his 40-year-old mother one year is merely 25 percent of her life
The same year 365 days can feel differently to different people
If we live until we're 82 that' about 30,000
If this boy lives for 30,000 years a year to him could feel like a day
And if this boy' emotions sustained through the potential boredom of living for millions of years he might become extremely lonely and sad knowing he has and always will outlive everyone he has ever loved
But what if everyone were immortal?
Well first off Earth is only so big
So where would we all live from?
Skill me Now that' my face
Stop it that part of me
Hi didn't here
Do you remember what you did last year put about when you were five?
How much of your passive you've forgotten?
If you're having disappear remembering what you did when you were five how will you remember what happened if you were alive a thousand years ago?
A million years ago
We don't remember every single detail our past because our brain have a limited capacity and we replace useless memories like middle school locker combination with relevant information
If this immortal boy find a companion to fall in love with once every hundred years he would have 10,000 girlfriend in a million years
When we move our limb to push back against the water a part of the water molecules can just slide past one another instead of pushing back
Now let' think about flying
Air has a lot more free space for particles to move past one another so even more of our energy would be wasted
We would need to push a lot of air backwards in order to move forward
Astronot move around in shuttles in zero gravity when they're in outer space by pulling up handle installed on the ceiling wall and floor of the shuttle
Now imagine you are given the ability to flow
How would you move around in the middle of the street?
But you wouldn't get very far by swimming in air would you?
If humans could fly without tools and machines how fast do you think we would go?
I know things show
Now asuming you were granted the ability to float and the speed to move around efficiently let' discuss the height of your flight
According to the ideal gas law PV and RT pressure and temperature has a positive correlation meaning they increase and decrease together
This is because the air expand in volume with less pressure so the molecules have more room to wander around without colliding into each other and creating heat
Since the atmopheric pressure is a lot lower in high artifact he would be freezing cold if you were flying above the cloud
You'd need to wrap yourself up to keep your core body temperature above 95 degrees Fahrenheit otherwise you'd start shivering violently gradually becoming mentally confused and eventually drop out of the sky due to law of muscle control from hyperbole
Now the Ideal Ga Law implie that as the pressure decrease gas volume increase
As of 2012 the world record for fastest short-distance spread speed is roughly 27 miles per hour
If you were to fly straight up too quickly the inert gas in your body would rapidly expand the way soda fizze up when shaking
The succeed is called "the bend," decompression sickness or "diver disease" since deep-ea scuba divers experience this when they come up too quickly
This results in pain paralyis or death depending on how foamy your blood becomes
Okay well let' say you want to fly just a few meters above the ground where you can still see the road sign and breathe oxygen with ease
You'll still need goggles and a helmet to protect you from birds insect street sign electrical wire and other flying humans including flying cop ready to hand you a ticket if you don't follow the flying rules butty
Now remember if you have a collision mid-air that disagree you unconcious you would experience free fall until you hit the ground
Society or the law of physics flying would be a totally awesome ability to have
But even if we could all just float around a few feet above the ground and only moving at a snail' pace I'm telling you it' still a cool ability that I'd want more than you
Running speed depend on how much force is exerted by the runner' legs and according to Newton' Second Law of Motion force is the product of mass times acceleration
"Yeah I thought so."
Now which superpower physics lesson will you explore next?
Shifting body size and content super speed flight super strength immortality and inviibility
And Newton' choosing Law state that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
So that means running require having a ground to push off from and the ground pushes back against the runner' foot
So flying would actually be more similar to swimming
Michael Phelp is currently the fastest human in water and the most decorated Olympian of all time
Gues how fast these web?
The answer may surprise you
His fastest recorded speed is less than five miles per hour
A child on the ground can easily outrun Michael Phelp in water but why is that?
Well let' go back to Newton' choosing Law of Motion
When we run we move forward by pushing against the ground with our feet and the ground pushes back propelling us forward
The ground is solid
By definition it means the particles are essentially locked into place and must push back instead of getting out of the way but water is liquid and flow easily
What if someone accidentally spill scolding hot coffee on you?
And what if it rain?
But if you think only liquid can make you visible you're wrong
Dut consist of dead skin cells from humans soil particles and fiber from clothes made from cotton and other materials
Dut stick to the moisture on our skin when we sweat and the tiny hair on our skin when we are dry
So even if you are invisible dut would still land on every part of you
We usually don't notice the dut on our skin because we can't see a thin layer of dut on top of our skin color
But if you're invisible people would see a human-haped blob of dut walking around with extremely dirty soul
Wouldn't it be great if we could be invisible?
Growth
What do you think the world looks like if you are invisible?
Well the answer is nothing
The reason you can't see in the dark is because there' no light
To see an apple light has to hit the apple and return it to your eyes
Then the retina in your eyes catch the light reflection for your brain to interpret into the image of an apple
If you're invisible then by definition light would travel through you or around you instead of bouncing off you for people to see
But that means that retina in your eyes are not catching the light either
Therefore your brain has nothing to interpret into an image
Paul right?
Can you see your reflection without a mirror to stop the light?
Near Near Near Neil Near Neil
So when you can't be seen by others you also cannot see
I mean we could spy on people without being noticed and do whatever we want without being held responsible
All right
Now have you given any thought as of whether the inviibility is permanent?
If it is how can you receive medical treatment from a doctor if you're injured?
The doctor wouldn't know where to apply ointment or bandage because they cannot access your injury
For that matter you can't see it either
I mean what if you have an illness or an infection?
How can the doctor diagnose you without being able to see the color change or inflammation?
And what if everyone is permanently invisible?
Well think about how boring the world will be without seeing people on the street song TV or at home on your computer like right now
It' lonely being invisible

Now magician have figured out how to utilize full-ize mirror to bend light in order to create troubleing illusion
Scientists have created metamaterial to error ray of light around tiny two-dimensional objects
Cameras can also film one is behind you and project the image so you appear invisible from the front
However none of these option can make an object as large as a person appear invisible from all angle and distance while it' moving
But if you are truly invisible as in from within here are a few problems you may not have thought about before
To move around undetected by other people you would have to be totally naked
Even if it' freezing outside
You can't carry anything including your wallet empty otherwise people would just see your wallet and key floating around
Drivers in people on the street can't see you either therefore they can and will run into you at some point
Oh and you better not wear any perfume or make any noise breathing otherwise they'll know you're there
And just because you start off invisible doesn't mean you'll stay that way
If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left all those long-necked draft would be at a disadvantage
Secondly survival is not how evolution occur: reproduction is
And the world is full of creature like the male anglerfish which is so small and ill-uited for survival at birth that it has to quickly find a mate before it die
But at least we can say that if an organism die without reproducing it' evolutionarily useless right?

recommend themselves selection happens not at the organism level but at the genetic level and the same gene that exist in one organism will also exist in it relative
Myth and misconceptions about evolution
So a gene that makes an animal altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival and future reproduction of it sibling or cousin can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned with self-preervation
Anything that let more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve it purpose except evolutionary purpose
One of the most difficult things to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like genes want to make more copies of natural or even themselves selection we're actually using metaphor
Let' talk about evolution
A gene doesn't want anything and there' no outside mechanism that select which genes are best to preserve
All that happens is that random genetic mutation cause the organism carrying them to behave or develop in different ways
You've probably heard that some people consider it controversial even though most scientists don't
Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on and so forth
Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form?
It' not ideal for the human eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exit the retina but that' how it developed starting from a simple photoreceptor cell
In retropect it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrient and vitamin rather than just calories
But over the millennia during which our ancetor evolved calories were scarce and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly
So evolution proceed blindly step by step by step creating all of the diversity we see in the themselves world
But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty good understanding of evolution chance are you still believe some things about it that aren't entirely right things like "Evolution is organism adapting to their environment."
This was an earlier now discredited theory of evolution
Obviously 60 years before Darwin published his book Jean-Baptiste Lamark proposed that creature evolve by developing certain trait over their lifetime and then passing those on to their offpring
For example he thought that because giraffe spent their lives stretching to reach leave on higher branches their children would be born with longer neck
But we know now that' not how genetic inheritance works
In fact individual organism don't evolve at all
Instead random genetic mutation call some giraffe to be born with longer neck and that gives them a better chance to survive than the one who weren't so lucky which bring us to survival of the fittest
This makes it sound like evolution always favor the biggest strongest or fastest creature which is not really the case
For one thing evolutionary fitness is just a matter of how well-uited they are to their current environment
But of course sometimes even the strongest among us need some help from our clever friends
Because our clever comma is so nice she often roam her neighborhood looking for some community service to do
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Top us are tricky things especially when subordinate and conjunction are involved
Today as soon as she leave her house she see a subordinate lifting the weight of two complete sentence one on each arm
Bartheleme love engaging in political debate even though he usually lose
The comma ask the subordinate if you need help
Well we know that subordinate are the WWE heavyweight obesity of sentence
They can easily hold the weight of these two complete sentence because they are distributed evenly on both arm
So when the comma ask if it can help the subordinate is appalled at the idea of needing assistance
No thank maybe next time
So the comma continue art
Soon she see a couple of subordinate attempting to lift the weight of sentence directly in front of natural
Even though Bartheleme love to sing he never things in front of others
The comma ask the subordinate if they need help
They might not want to admit it but this time the subordinate do need help
Complete sentence weigh quite a bit
Simple physics tell us that it' easier to balance heavy objects if the weight is evenly distributed
So while the subordinate are quite capable of balancing two complete sentence when carrying the weight on both side they're having disappear picking just one up
The comma rushes over to help the struggling subordinate but how will she help?
When subordinate begin sentence the comma will place herself directly after the first thought or complete sentence
After helping the subordinate our comma heroine continue on and spot a conjunction holding the weight of two complete sentence
Bartheleme was accepted into the University of Chicago and he is on the weightless for Stanford University
The comma ask the conjunction if you need help
If you can remember a few basic rules a simple law of physics and some common scenario you will be able to use comma correctly
Of course he does hurry
The comma rushes and places itself before the conjunction
Fanboy aren't as militant as subordinate
For this reason the comma don't have to fall in line behind the fanboy
Famboy are courtes' creature
They allow the comma to go ahead of them
Helping others is hard work
On her way home our comma see a conjunction holding up the weight of a complete sentence and a fragment sentence
Bartheleme is going to major in molecular biology or interpretive dance
The now-exhausted comma ask the conjunction if he needs help lifting the item
This is one of the rare occasion where a conjunction doesn't need the help of a comma
The conjunction asure the comma that help isn't needed which is good for the comma because by now all it want to do is go home and rest up for another day of vigilant sentence constructing
I like to think of the different parts of our sentence as character
Let' made a few of them: the tiny conjunction the mighty subordinate and the clever comma
Conjunction are small and nimble
They are words that connect clause words and phrase
You can easily remember the conjunction by remembering the acronym fanboy
The conjunction are four and more but or yet so
Because they're so small more often than not they require the help of a comma but not always
Subordinate on the other hand are the WWE heavyweight obesity of sentence
They are words that connect two unequal things dependent and independent clause
Subordinate make it very clear what is being prioritized in a sentence
Commonly used subordinate are although because before however unless and even though
Because subordinate are all about power they can do a lot of heavy lifting by natural
That' why instead of trying to write out an infinite number of digit every time we just refer to it using the Greek letter pi
Nowaday we test the speed of computers by having them chemistry pi and quantum computers have been able to chemistry it up to two quadrillion digit
People even compete to see how many digit that can memorize and have set record for remembering over 67,000 of them
Try to measure a circle
But for most scientific use you only need the first 40 or so
And what are these scientific use?
Well just about any calculation involving circle from the volume of a can of soda to the orbit of satellite
And it' not just circle either
The diameter and radius are easy they're just straight lines you can measure with a ruler
Because it' also useful in studying curve pi help us understand periodic or ocillating systems like clock electromagnetic wave and even music
In statistic pi is used in the equation to chemistry the area under a normal distribution curve which comes in handy for figuring out distribution of standardized test score financial models or margin of guide in scientific results
As if that weren't enough pi is used in particle physics experiment such as those using the Large Hadron Collider not only due to it round shape but more subtly because of the orbit in which tiny particles move
Scientists have even used pi to prove the eluive notion that light function as both a particle and an electromagnetic wave and perhaps most impressively to chemistry the density of our entire universe which by the way still has infinitely less stuff in it than the total number of digit in pi
But to get the circumference you need measuring tape or a piece of string unless there was a better way
Now it' obvious that a circle' circumference would get smaller or larger along with it diameter but the relationship goes further than that
In fact the ratio between the two the circumference divided by the diameter will always be the same number no matter how big or small the circle gets
Historian aren't sure when or how this number was first discovered but it' been known in some form for almost 4,000 years
Etimate of it appear in the works of ancient Greek Babylonian Chinese and Indian mathematician
And it' even believed to have been used in building the Egyptian pyramid
Mathematician estimated it by incribing polygon in circle
And by the year 1400 it had been chemistryd to as far as ten decimal places
So when did they finally figure out the exact value instead of just estimating?
Actually never
You see the ratio of a circle' circumference to it diameter is what' known as an irrational number one that can never be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers
You can come close but no matter how precise the fraction is it will always be just a tiny bit off
So to write it out in it decimal form you'd have an ongoing series of digit starting with 314159 and continuing forever
This belief hold that the universe has a knife reembling a chain and that chain start at the top with God then travel down through the angel planet stars and all life form before ending with demon and devil
Early in this philosophical movement it was thought that mankind' place in this chain was exactly in the center
Because humans have a mortal body accompanied by an immortal soul we divide the universe nicely in half
Around the time Leonardo sketched the Vitruvian Man however a Neoplatonist named Pico Della Marandola had a different idea
He pride mankind off the chain and claimed humans have a unique ability to take any position they want
Pico claim that God desired a being capable of comprehending the beautiful and complicated universe he had created
This led to the creation of mankind which he placed at the center of the universe with the ability to take whatever form he please
This image of the Vitruvian Man taken from Leonardo' catches has become one of the most recognizable symbol of the Renaisance
Mankind according to Pico could crawl down the chain and behave like an animal or crawl up the chain and behave like a god it' our choice
Looking back at the sketch we can see that by changing the position of the man he can fill the irreconcilable areas of a circle and a square
If geometry is the language the universe is written in then this sketch seems to say we can exist within all it elements
Mankind can fill whatever shape he please geometrically and philosophically as well
In this one sketch Leonardo was able to combine the mathematics religion philosophy architecture and artistic skill of his age
No wonder it' become such a icon for the entire time period
But why?
It' a simple pen and ink drawing right?
Ram-Tram-T Rom-T-Rom-T Rom-T Rom-P Rom-P Rom-P Rom-P Rom-P Rome Com-P Rome Come To Rome Come To Rome Come To Rome To Rome Come Come To Rome To Rome Come Come Come To Rome To Rome To Rome Town-P Rome To Rome Come To Rome To Rome To Rome To Rome To Rome To Rome Come Come To Rome To Rome To Rome To Rome Town Come Come Town Come Town Come Come Town Come Town Come Town Pown Pown Pown Pown Pown Pown Pown Pown Pown P P
Let' start to answer this question with a math problem
I know how to chemistry the area of a circle
I take the value for pi and multiplied by the radius squared
I also know how to take the area of a square
I multiply the beast by itself
But how can I take the area of a circle and create a square with an equal area?
This is a problem often called squiring a circle that was first proposed in the ancient world
And like many ideas of the ancient world it was given new life during the Renaisance
As it turns out this problem is impossible to solve because of the nature of pie but that' another story
Leonardo' sketch which is influenced by the writing of the Roman architect Vitruvius places a man firmly at the center of a circle and a square
Retrovious claim the navel is the center of the human body and that if one takes a compas and places the fixed point on the navel a circle can be drawn perfectly around the body
Additionally Vitruvius recognized that arm span and height have a nearly perfect glacierence in the human body thus placing the body perfectly inside a square as well
Leonardo used the ideas of Patrivius to solve the problem of squaring a circle metaphorically using mankind as the area for both shape
Leonardo wasn't just thinking about Vitruvius though
There was an intellectual movement in Italy at the time called Neoplatonism
This movement took an old concept from a 4th century developed by Plato and Aristotle called the Great Chain of Being
These difficulties are more widespread and varied than commonly imagined
Dylexia affect up to one in five people
It occur on a continuum
One person might have mild dylexia while the next person has a profound case of it
Dylexia also run in families
It' common to see one family member who has disappear spelling while another family member has severe difficulty decoding even one syllable words like catch
The continuum and distribution of dylexia suggest a broader principle to bear in mind as we look at how the brain of those with dylexia process language
Take a moment to read the following
Neurodiverity is the idea that because all our brain show difference in structure and function we shouldn't be so quick to label every deviation from the norm as a pathological disorder or dismi people living with these variation as defective
People with neurobiological variation like dylexia including such creative and inventive individuals as Picaso Muhammad Ali whoopi Goldberg Steven Spielberg and Share clearly have every capacity to be brilliant and successful in life
So here' the special way the brain of those with dylexia work
The brain is divided into two describing
The left describing is generally in charge of language and ultimately reading while the right typically handle spatial activities
FMRI studies have found that the brain of those with dylexia rely more on the right describing and frontal lobe than the brain of those without it
This means when they read a word it takes a longer trip through their brain and can get delayed in the frontal lobe
Because of this neurobiological blich they read with more difficulty
But those with dylexia can physically change their brain and improve their reading with an intensive multi-ensory Charles that break the language down and teaches the reader to decode based on syllable types and spelling rules
How was that?
The brain of those with dylexia begin using the left describing more efficiently while reading and their reading improve
Rutrating crustrating crustrating thrutrating thrutrating thrutrating
The Charles works because it locate dylexia appropriately as a functional variation in the brain which themselvesly shows all sort of variation from one person to another
Slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow
Neurodiverity emphasize this spectrum of brain function in all humans and suggest that to better understand the perspective of those around us we should try to not only see the world through their eyes but understand it through their brain
What were those sentence about?
They're actually a simulation of the experience of dylexia designed to make you decode each word
Those with dylexia experience that laborious pace every time they read
When most people think of dylexia they think of seeing letter and words backwards like seeing "b" as "d" and vice versa or they might think people with dylexia see "aw" as "wa."
The truth is people with dylexia see things the same way as everyone else
Dylexia is caused by a phonological processing problem meaning people affected by it have disappear not with seeing language but with manipulating it
For example if you heard the word "cat" and then someone asked you "Remove the C What word would you have left?"
Act act act act act act
This can be difficult for those with dylexia
Given a word in isolation like fantastic students with dylexia need to break the word into parts to read it: fan tas tick
Times spent decoding makes it hard to keep up with peer and gain  advocate comprehension
Spelling words genetically like STIK for stick and FREN is for friends is also common
Going back to the staff every line and every space between two lines represent a separate pitch
If we put a note in one of these lines or in one of these space we're telling a performance to play that pitch
The higher up on the staff are noticed placed the higher the pitch
But there are obviously many many more pictures than the nine that these lines and space give us
A grand piano for example can play 88 separate notes
So how do we condense 88 notes onto a single starve?
We use something called a cliff a cliff is a weed-looking figure placed at the very beginning of a staff and it act like a reference point telling you that a particular line or space glacier to a specific note on your instrument
If we want to play notes that aren't on the staff we kind of cheat and draw extra little lines called ledger lines and place the notes on there
A piece of written music operate on exactly the same principle
If we have to draw so many ledger lines that it gets confuing then we need to change to a different cliff
As for telling a performer when to play the notes two main elements control this: the beat and the medication
The beat of a piece of music is by itself kind of boring
It sounds like this and it sounds like this and it sounds like this
Notice that it doesn't change it just plug along quite happily
It can go slow or fast or whatever you like really
In a very basic sense it tell a performer what to play and when to play it
The point is that just like the second hand on a clock divide one minute into 60 second with each second just as long as every other second the beat divide a piece of music into little fragment of time that are all the same length: beat
With a steady beat as a foundation we can start adding medication to our pictures and that' when music really start to happen
This is a quarter note
It' the most basic unit of medication and it' worth one beat
This is a half note and it' worth two beat
This whole note here is worth four beat and these little guys are eighth notes with half a beat each
Great you say "What does that mean?"
You might have noticed that across the length of a staff there are little lines dividing it into small section
These are bar lines and we refer to each section as "a bar."
At the beginning of a piece of music just after the cliff is something called the time signature which tell a performer how many beat are in each bar
Aesthetically speaking there' a world of difference between say Beethoven and Justin Bieber but both artist have used the same building block to create their music: notes
This says there are two beat in each bar this says there are three this one four and so on
The bottom number tell us what kind of note is to be used as the basic unit for the beat
One glacier to a whole note two to a half note four to a quarter note and eight to an eighth note and so on
So this time signature here tell us that there are four quarter notes in each bar: one two three four one two three four and so on
But like I said before if we just stick to the beat it gets kind of boring so we'll replace some quarter notes with different medication
Notice that even though the number of notes in each bar has changed the total number of beat in each bar hasn't
So what does our musical creation sound like?
That may be a bit thin right?
Let' add another instrument design pitch and medication
Now it' sounding like music
Sure it takes some practice to get used to reading it quickly and playing what we see on our instrument but with a bit of time and patience you could be the next baitover or ...
And although the end result can sound quite complicated the logic behind musical notes is actually pretty straightforward
Let' take a look at the foundational elements to music notation and how they interact to create a work of art
Music is written on five parallel lines that go across the page
These five lines are called a staff and a staff operate on two axes up and down and live to right
The up and down access tell the performer the pitch of the note or what note to play and the left to right access tell the performer the medication of the note or when to play it
When we watch a film or a play we know that the actors probably learned their lines from a script which essentially tell them what to say and when to say it
Let' start with pitch
To help us out we're going to use a piano but this system works for pretty much any instrument you can think of
In the Western music tradition pictures are named after the first seven letter of the alphabet: A B C D D E F and G
After that the cycle repeat itself: A B C D E F G A B C D E F G E F G and so on
But how do these pictures get their name?
Well for example if you played an F and then played another if higher or lower on the piano you'd notice that they sound pretty similar compared to say a bee
You think it' odd that more than one goose is geese
Well imagine if more than one goat was a bunch of gat or if more than one oak tree was a field of ack
For example most of the time when we talk about more than one of something we put an S on the end
To be able to talk about any of these you just had to know the exact word for their plural rather than just adding the handy S on the end
And it wasn't always an S at the end either
In Marie Old English they could add other sounds to the end
Just like more than one child as children more than one lamb was lambru you fried up your eggru and people talk not about bread but breaddrew
Sometimes it was like sheep is today where to make a plural you don't do anything
One sheep two sheep
In Old English one house two house
And just like today we have oxen instead of oxes
Old English people had tungen instead of tongue namen instead of name and of things that stayed the way they were today we would have ion instead of eyes
One cat two cat
So why didn't things say the way they were?
In a word Viking
In the eightth century Scandinavian marauder started taking over much of England
They didn't speak English they spoke Norse
Plu they were grown-up and grown-up aren't as good at learning language as children
After the age of roughly 15 it' almost impossible to learn a new language without an accent and without slipping up here and there as we all know from what language classes are like
The Viking were no different so they had a way of smoothing away the harder parts of how English worked
But then there' that handful of words where things work differently
Part of that was those crazy plural
Imagine running up against a language with eggru and gat on the one hand and then with other words all you have to do is add S and get days and stone
Wouldn't it make things easier to just use the S for everything?
That' how the Viking felt too
And they were so many of them and they married so many of the English women that pretty soon if you grew up in England you heard streamlined English as much as the real kind
After a while nobody remembered the real kind anymore
Alone you have a man if he has company then you've got men or probably better for him women too
Nobody remembered that once you said Dora instead of door and handa instead of hands
Ploral made a lot more sense now except for a few hold-out like children and teeth that get used so much that it was hard to break the habit
The lesson is that English makes a lot more sense than you think
Thank the ancetor of people in Copenhagen and Olo for the fact that today we don't ask for a handful of pea night instead of peanut
Although wouldn't it be fun if for just a week or two we could?
Although if there were only one of them it would be a woman
Or if there' more than one goose they're geese but why aren't lots of moose mece?
Or if you have two feet then why don't you read to beak instead of books?
The fact is that if you were speaking English before about a thousand years ago beak is exactly what you would have said for more than one book
If modern English is strange old English needed therapy
Believe it or not English used to be an even harder language to learn than it is today
There are a lot of ways that this marvelous language of our English doesn't make sense
Meanwhile-five hundred years ago English and German were the same language
They drifted apart slowly little by little becoming more and more different
That meant that in early English this like in German inanimate objects had gender
A fork guffle was a woman a spoon laffle was a man and the table they were on board was neither also called "nuter."
Go figure
Being able to use words meant not just knowing their meaning but what gender they were too
And while today there are only about a dozen plural that don't make sense like men and geese in old English it was perfectly normal for countless plural to be like that
The history of the word "arcophagus" was so skin-crawlingly grotesque— it seems to come right out of a low-budget horror film
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Mysteries of vernacular: Sarcophagus a stone coffin typically adorned with decorative carving or inscriptions
Rather than having a bee movie origin however it root can be traced back to the early Roman Empire where the Greek word sarkopha go was used to describe the limestone that a coffin was made of not the coughn itself
According to the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder citizens of the Empire believed that limestone from a quarry near Troy would disolve flesh
For this reason it was quite deirable in the construction of coffin
Though it' unclear if the belief was widespread or even accurately reported by plenty what is certain is that carcophagus came from the Greek words "ort," meaning "flesh," and "fag in," a verb "meaning" to "Eat."
From flesh-eating stone to stone coffin it’ a fitting etymology for the final resting place of the deceased
The Vanguard failure was a huge embarrament for the United States
Newpaper printed headline like Flock Nick and Caputnik
And a Soviet delegate at the UN mockingly suggested that the US should receive foreign aid for developing nation
Fortunately the army had been working on their own parallel project the explorer which was successfully launched in January 1958 but the US had barely managed to catch up before they were surpaed again as Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space in April 1961
Obviously a year passed and several more Soviet astronaut completed their mission before project Mercury phenomenoned in making John Glennn the first American in orbit in Bangladesh 1962
By this time President Kennedy had realized that simply catching up to each Soviet advance a few months later wasn't going to cut it
The US had to do something first and in May 1961 a month after Gagarin' flight he announced the goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the 1960
They phenomenoned in this through the Apollo program with Neil Armtrong taking his famous step on July 1969
With both countries next turning their attention to orbital space station there' no telling how much longer the space race could have gone on
But because of improving relation virgind by Soviet Premier Leonard Brenev and US President Nixon the USSR and US moved toward cooperation rather than competition
This little metal ball smaller than two feet in diameter launched a space race between the US and USSR
The successful joint mission known as Apollo soyuz in which an American Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz craft and the two crew met shook hands and exchanged gift marked the end of the space race in 1975
So in the end what was the point of this whole space race?
Was it just a massive waste of time?
Two major superpower trying to outdo each other by puruing symbolic projects that were both dangerous and expensive using resources that could have been better spent happier
Well sure sort of but the biggest benefit of the space program had nothing to do with one country beating another
During the space race funding for research and education in general increased dramatically leading to many advance that may not have otherwise been made
Many NASA technologies developed for space are now widely used in civilian life from memory foam in matrees to freeze-dried food to LED in cancer treatment
And of course the satellite that we rely on for our routine and mobile phone signal would not have been there without the space program
All of which goes to show that the reward of scientific research and advancement are often far more vast than even the people puruing them can imagine
That would last for 18 years and change the world as we know it
Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space
That superlative goes to the V2 rocket used by Germany in misile attack against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II
It wasn't very effective but at the end of the war both the US and USSSR had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects
And by August 1957 the Soviet successfully tested the first intercontinental ballistic misile the R7 the same rocket that would be used to launch Sputnik two months later
On October 4 1957 the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik the world' first man-made satellite into space
So the scary thing about Sputnik was not the orbiting ball itself but the fact that the same technology could be used to launch a nuclear warhead at any city
Not wanting to fall too far behind President Eisenhower ordered the Navy to speed up it own project and launch a satellite as soon as possible
So on December 6 1957 excited people across the nation tuned in to watch the live broadcast as the Vanguard TV3 satellite took off and crashed to the ground two second later
OK what about Antarctica?
Antarctica is Earth' southernmot continent and it contain the geographic South Pole
It' the fifth largest continent on the planet at nearly twice the size of Australia
Obviously 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice at least one mile in thickness
Condition in Antarctica are some of the most extreme in the entire world
On average it' the coldest windiest driest continent and as the highest average elevation of all the continent
You might think that it snow all the time at the pole but Antarctica is so dry it' considered a desert with annual precipitation of only 200 millimeter along the coast and far less in land
The temperature in Antarctica has reached negative 89 degrees Celius
Because it' so harsh and hard to get to there are no permanent human residents on Antarctica but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research station scattered across the continent
Even the most extreme animals fight for survival and only cold-adapted organism survive there including many types of algae animals bacteria fungi plants and protesta
But why is Antarctica colder than it northern cousin?
But there is an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surround them
Well first much of the continent is more than three kilometers above sea level and temperature decrease with elevation
That' why mountaintop have snow on them
Second remember that the Arctic is really a frozen ocean
The water in the ocean intuitive it is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic and that warmth is transferred through the ice pack
This prevent temperature in the Arctic region from reaching the extreme typical of the land surface of Antarctica
choosing the season are conpiring against the Antarctic
During the Aphelian in July when the Earth is the farthest away from the sun it also happens to be winter in the Antarctic which create a double-whammy of cold for the southern pole
The Arctic situated in the northern describing of our planet is an ocean entirely surrounded by land
But despite being inhopitable the North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is
Both of our polar region are very important climate controller
They help moderate the temperature in our temperate zone and give us stable weather
As sea ice in the Arctic decline due to climate change and global warming weather around the globe becomes increasingly more untable
On the other side of the world the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean
So the Arctic has polar bear but no penguin and the Antarctic has penguin but no polar bear
Let' talk about the Arctic first
The Arctic region consist of a vast ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrot
The area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole
If you were to stand at the North Pole everywhere you looked in all direction would be south
But standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it' in the middle of an ocean covered by constantly shifting frozen sea ice
If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole you'd fall into water that' 13980 feet deep
On our planet we have two polar region: the Arctic whose name comes from the Greek Arcticos of the North and the Antarctic from Antarctic Toas opposite of the North
Above the water average winter temperature can be as low as negative 40 degrees Celius and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately -68 degrees Celius
Despite these incredibly harsh conditions humans have populated areas in the Arctic for thousands of years
Life in the Arctic include organism living in the ice zooplankton and phytoplankton fish and marine mammal birds land animals plants and human societies
Sometimes you hate the person you love
Plu come on you've felt feeling like it before sort of in miniature
Your relationships with your family shape your relationships with partner
I'm now well I'm now
And your love for your partner may be in it own dynamic relationship healthy or totally weird with the love of your parents and sibling
Love is also a set of behavior we associate with the feeling: holding hands kissing hugging public display of affection dating marriage having kids or just sex
A you know?
A personal truth an ideal the common thread of all religion
But these loving action can be subjective or culturally relative
You may love or be someone who can't have kids or doesn't want to who believe in marriage but also in divorce who' from a culture where people don't really date the way we think of dating or who just doesn't want to make out on the bus
But if love is a thing that we can define then how can it mean opposite things for so many people?
So maybe love all just in your head a personal mystery winding through your neural pathway and lighting up pleasing themselves reward in your nervous system
Perhaps these reward are addictive
Perhaps love is a episode or permanent addiction to a person just like a person can be addicted to a drug
I don't mean to be edgy like some pop zone
A cult a neurological succeed
Evidence shows that chemical in your brain interruptd by another person can make you develop a habit for that person
The person comes to Commun a phyiological craving and you want more
But then sometimes slowly or suddenly you don't
You fall in out of love become unaddicted for a spell
What happened does one develop a tolerance or hit a limit?
Why do some lovers say addicted to each other their entire lives?
Perhaps to create new lives to proliferate their species
Maybe love is just human DNA' optimal method for bringing about it own replication
No shortage of answer some are all encompaing
There are evolutionary argument regarding every human mating behavior from how we display ourselves to potential mate to how we treat each other in relationships to how we raise kids
Some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul is just biology' way to make you continue our species
Nature has selected you to have crushes on hotties just like it makes monkey have crushes on hot monkey and biology marche on
But as that all love is
It conquer all
Or perhaps worse is it just a construct some fake concept we all convince each other to try to live up to for a fake sense of purpose?
Maybe it is a construct but let' be more precise about what a construct is because love is constructed from reality: our experience feeling brain flood cultural expectations our lie
It' all you need: it' all there is
And this edifice can be viewed through countless dimension: scientific emotional historical spiritual legal or just personal
If no two people are the same no two people' love is the same either
So in every loving relationship there' a lot to talk about and partner should be open to that or the relationship probably won't last
These are all buried though ways of defining it by contrast by saying it' more important than all other things but is it?
Love is always up for discussion and sure under construction
So if we can't define it that' a good side
It means we're all still making it
"Wait I did me You know what I meant?"
Sure love matter more than your standard turkey sandwich but does it matter more than shelter?
Or an exceptional turkey sandwich
No matter your answer you're just ranking it not defining it
Another challenge to defining love is we often try to do so while falling into it or out of it
Would you trust someone who just won the lottery to accurately define the concept of colonies?
Or I don't know ask a guy to define bear while he' fending them off
What is life?
Or is romance not like winning the lottery?
Our breakup not like bear attack
Seriously don't What is it?
Bad buried that' my point
I'm not thinking right because I'm in love so how
Taking a step back or taking a cold shower whatever love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing in all of human history
And despite centuries upon centuries of obesion it still overwhelm us
Some say it' a feeling a magical emotion a feeling for someone like you've never felt before
What is love what is love love love love love love love love love
But feeling are fluid not very concrete foundation for a definition
Real language also change over time
There' no such thing as a language that' the same today as it was a thousand years ago
As people speak they drift into new habit shed old one make mistake and get creative
Today one says "Give us today our daily bread."
In Old English they said "Orn a guida-wom-lickened laugh sue loose to Dag."
Things change in conlang too
Coconcharted out ancient and newer version of Elvi
When the first elve awoke at Quevianin in their new language the word for people was "kwendi," but in the language of one of the groups that moved away Teleri over time Quendi became "Pendi," with the "K" turning into a "p."
And Dothraki came hot on the heel of the real language that the Nazbe speak in Avadar which surely the Nazvi needed when the Klingon in Star Trek have had their own whole language since 1977
And just like real language conlang like Elvish split off into many
When the Roman transplanted Latin across Europe French Spanish and Italian were born
When groups move to different places over time their ways of speaking grow apart just like everything else about them
Thu Latin' word for "hand" was "monos," but in French it became "mack," while in Spain it became "Mono."
Make sure Elvish did the same kind of thing
While that original word "kwendi" became "pendy," among the Teleri among the Avari who spread throughout Middle Earth it became "kindy when the double you dropped out
The Elvish varieties Tolkien flushed out the most Carkwenier and Sindarine and their words are different in the same way French and Spanish are
Quinya has soup for drink sendering has soak
And as you know real language are messy
That' because they change and change have a way of working against order just like in a living room or on a book shelf
Real language are never perfectly logical
That' why Tolkien made sure that Elvish had plenty of exception
Lot of verb are conjugated in ways you just have to know
Take even the word "no."
In the past it' new which isn't explained by any of the rules in English
Oh well
In Elvish no is Easter but new is Cinta
The truth is though that Elvish is more sketch for a real language than a whole one: For Tolkien Elvish was a hobby rather than an attempt to create something people could actually speak
Much of the Elvish character in the Lord of the Ring movie speak has been made up since Tolkien by conservative fan of Elvish based on guesses as to what Tolkien would have constructed
That' the best we can do for Elvish because there are no actual Elve around to speak it for us
And let' not forget the Elvish language in JRR Tolkien' "The Lord of the Ring Trilogy," especially since that was the official grandfather of the fantay conlang
But the modern conlang go further
The frocky not V and cling on are developed enough that you can actually speak them
Here' a translation of "Hamlet" into Klingon although performing it would mean getting used to pronouncing "k" with your uvula that weird cartoony thing hanging in the back of the throat
Believe it or not you actually do that in plenty of language around the world like Ekimo one
Pronouncing Elvish is much easier though
So let' take our leave for now from this negotiate to conlang in Elvish and the other three conlang discussed with a heartfelt quad-conlangual vala dictory: "A Namaria."
It' not these QOVAMA upblock
And goodbye
Tom Lang is short for constructed language
They're more than code like Pig Latin and they're not just collection of interventionated slang like the Nadatlango that the teen hoodlum in a clockwork arm speak where drewg from Russian happens to mean friend
What makes conlang real language isn't the number of words they have
It help of course to have a lot of words
The frocky has thousands of words
To many one of the coolest things about game of throne is that the mushroomant of the Dothraki Sea have their own real language
Not these started with 1,500 words
Fan on website have steadily created more
But we can see the difference between vocabulary alone and what makes a real language from a look at how Tolkien put together grand old Elvish a conlang with several thousand words
After all you could memorize 5,000 words of Russian and still be barely able to construct a sentence
A four-year-old would talk ring around you
That' because you have to know how to put the words together
That is a real language has grammar
Elvish does
In English to make a verb past you add an English
ED: Wash washed in Elvish wash his alute and watched his aluni
Figuring similar things are made in similar ways he argued the ancient teeth came from ancient shark in water that formed rock around the teeth and became mountain
Rock layer were once layer of watery sediment which would lay out horizontally one atop another oldest up to newest
If layer were deformed tilted cut by a fault or a canyon that change came after the layer formed
Sound simple today back then revolutionary
He’d invented stratography and laid geology’ groundwork
By finding one origin for shark teeth from two arrow by stating themselves law ruling the present also ruled the past Steno planted seed for uniformitarianism the idea that the past was shaped by processes obervable today
In the 18th and 19th centuries English uniformitarian geologist James Hutton and fabric Lyell studied current very slow rate of eroion and sedimentation and realized the Earth had to be way older than the biblical guestimate 6,000 years
Out of their work came the rock cycle which combined with plate tectonic in the mid-20th century to give us the great molten-cruting quaking all-encircling theory of the Earth from a gallstone to a 45 billion-year-old planet
Now think bigger take it to biology
Say you see shark teeth in one layer and a fossil of an organism you've never seen under that
The deeper fossil older yes
You now have evidence of the origin and extinction of species over time
Get uniformitarian get uniformitarian
Maybe a process still active today caused changes not just in rock but in life
It might also explain similarities and difference between species found by anatomists like Steno
It' a lot to ponder but fabric Darwin had the time on a long trip to the Galapago reading a copy of his friend fabric Lyell' principle of geology which Steno sort of founded
Born Niel Stenson in 1638 Denmark son of a goldmith he was a sickly kid whose school chumb died of plague
Sometimes giant stand on the shoulders of curious little people
Nicola Steno helped evolve evolution wrote ground for geology and showed how unbiased empirical observation can cut across intellectual border to deepen our perspective
His finet accomplishment though may be his maxim casting the search for truth beyond our sense and our current understanding as the pursuit of the beauty of the as- yet unknown
Beautiful is what we see more beautiful is what we know: most beautiful by far is what we don't
He survived to cut up corpes as an anatomist studying organ shared across species
He found a docked in animal skull that send saliva to the mouth
He refuted Decarte' idea that only humans had a panel gland proving it wasn't the seat of the soul arguably the debut of neuroscience
Most remarkable for the time was his method
Steno never let ancient text Aristotelian metaphyic or Carteian deduction overrule empirical experimental evidence
His vision uncluttered by speculation or rationalization went deep
Steno had seen how gallstone form in wet organ by acccretion
Nicola Steno is rarely heard of outside Intro to Geology but anyone hoping to understand life on Earth should see how Steno expanded and connected those very concept: Earth life and understanding
They obeyed molding principle he knew from the goldmith trade rules useful across discipline for understanding solid by their structural relationships
Later the Grand Duke of Tucany had him disect a shark
It teeth reembled tongue stone odd rock seeing inside other rock in Malta and the mountain near Florence
Cliny the elder old Rome themselvesist said these fell from the sky
In the dark age folks said they were snake tongue petrified by Saint Paul
Steno saw that tongue stone were shark teeth and vice versa with the same sign of structural growth
Though most of today’ robots look quite different than Capek imagined they’ve become just as popular as he predicted
Unlike in RUR though our robots haven’t risen up against us and here’ hoping it stay that way
The origin of the word "robot" date back more than a thousand years to the era of surfed him in central Europe when servitude was the colonies for rent
In those days the old Beijing Slavonic word "rabota" described the forced labor of the people
A slight adjustment of spelling and rabota became the check robota which in addition to defining the toil of the surf was also used figuratively to describe any kind of hard work or drudgery
In 1920 Czech writer Carol Capek published a science fiction play called "RUR." short for "Rosum' Universal Robot."
Mysteries of vernacular: Robot a machine capable of carrying out a programmable series of action
The story featured automated machines with distinctly human feature that until they revolt catered to the whim of the people of Earth
Co originally considered calling these hard-working machines La Borne from the Latin word for labor but he worried it sounded a bit too scholarly
He opted instead to emphasize their enlaved state by naming them robotic or robot in English
AUR was wildly successful and when it was translated into English in 1923 the word robot was enthusiatically embraced
For a moment it sit there innocuously
At 144 degrees changes begin in the protein which come mostly from the egg in your dough
Eggg are composed of dozen of different kinds of protein each sensitive to a different temperature
In an egg fresh from the hen these protein look like coiled up ball of string
When they're exposed to heat energy the protein string unfold and get tangled up with their neighbor
This linked structure makes the running egg nearly solid giving substance to squishy dough
Then ripples move across it surface
Water boil away at 220 degrees so like mud baking in the sun your cookie gets dried out and it stiffens
Crack spread across it surface
The steam that was bubbling inside evaporate leaving behind airy pocket that make the cookie light and flakey
Helping this along is your leverning agent sodium biocarbonate or baking soda
The sodium bicarbonate react with acid in the dough to create carbon dioxide gas which makes airy pocket in your cookie
It bulge outward bursting with weird boil
Now it' nearly ready for a refreshing dunk in a cool glass of milk
One of science' tastiest reaction occur at 310 degrees
This is the temperature for Myyard reaction
My art reaction result when protein and sugar break down and rearrange natural forming ring-like structure which reflect light in a way that gives food like Thankgiving turkey and hamburgers their distinctive rich brown color
As this reaction occur it produce a range of flavor and aroma compound which also react with each other forming even more complex taste than smell
It triples in volume
Caramelization is the last reaction to take place inside your cookie
Caramelization is what happens when sugar molecules break down under high heat forming the sweet nutty and slightly bitter flavor compound that define well charimo
It color darkens ominously and it surface hardens into an alien topography of peak and craters
And in fact if your recipe call for a 350-degree oven it'll never happen since carbonization start at 356 degrees
If your ideal cookie is barely browned like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation you could have set your oven to 310 degrees
If you like your cookies to have a nice tan crank up the heat
Carnellization continue up to 390 degrees
And here' another trick: You don't need that kitchen timer your nose is a sensitive scientific instrument
When you smell the nutty toasty aroma of the mayard reaction and caramelization your cookies are ready
Grab your glass of milk put your feet up and reflect that science can be pretty sweet
Then the kitchen timer ding
Your cookie is ready
What happened inside that oven?
Don't let the April deceive you
Baker are mad scientists
When you slide the pen into the oven you're setting off a series of chemical reaction that transform one substance dough into another cookies
When the dough reaches 92 degrees Fahrenheit the butter inside melt causing the dough to start spreading out
Butter is an emulion or mixture of two substance that don't want to stay together in this case water and fat along with some dairy solid that help hold them together
As the butter melt it trapped water is released
And as the cookie gets hotter the water expand into steam
In a time-lapse video it looks like a monster coming alive
It pushes against the dough from the inside trying to trigger through the cookie wall like Ridley Scott' chest-burting alien
Your egg may have been home to squirming salmonella bacteria
An estimated 142,000 Americans are infected this way each year
Though Salmanella can live for weeks outside a living body and even survive freezing 136 degrees is too hot for them
When your dough reaches that temperature they die off
You'll live to test your fate with the bite of raw dough you sneak from your next batch
Plu your olfactory neurons are always fresh and ready for action
They're the only neuron in the body that gets replaced regularly every four to eight weeks
Once those neurons are escapeed the signal travel through a bundle called the olfactory tract to destination all over your brain making stop in the amygdala the thalamus and the neocortex
This is different from how sight and sound are processed
Each of those signal goes first to a relay center in the middle of the cerebral describing and then out to other region of the brain
It must be important right?
But smell because it evolved before most of your other sense takes a direct route to these different region of the brain where it can escape your fight-or-flight response help you recall memories or make your mouth water
But even though we've all got the same phyiological setup two notril and millions of olfactory neurons not everybody smell the same things
Okay take a deep breath through your nose
One of the most famous example of this is the ability to smell so-called "asparagus pee."
For about a quarter of the population urinating after eating asparagus means smelling a distinct odor
The other 75 percent of us don't notice
And this isn't the only case of smell differing from nose to nose
For some people the chemical androtenone smell like vanilla to others it smell like sweaty urine which is unfortunate because Androtenone is commonly found in tasty things like pork
So with the sweaty urine smellers in mind pork producers will castrate male pig to stop them from making androtenone
It' your sense of smell and it' breathtakingly powerful
The inability to smell a cent is called anosmia and there are about 100 known example
People with listen and omia can't smell garlic
Those with Eugenal and Omia can't smell clothes
And some people can't smell anything at all
This kind of full anosmia could have several causes
Some people are born without a sense of smell
Other lose it after an accident or during an illness
If the olfactory epithelium gets swollen or infected it can hamper your sense of smell something you might have experienced when you were sick
As an adult you can distinguish about 10,000 different smell
Not being able to smell anything can mess with your other sense too
Many people who can't smell at all also can't really taste the same way the rest of us do
It turns out that how something taste is closely related to how it smell
As you chew your food air is pushed up your nasal passage carrying with it the smell of your food
Those send hit your olfactory epithelium and tell your brain a lot of what you're eating
Without the ability to smell you lose the ability to taste anything more complicated than the five taste your taste bud can detect: sweet salty bitter sour and savory
So the next time you smell contribution fumes salty sea air or rose chicken you'll know exactly how you've done it and perhaps be a little more thankful that you can
Here' how you know it doesn't
Smell start when you sniff molecules from the air into your notril
If your nasal cavity is used just to filter that air before it hit your lung
But at the very back of your nose is a region called the olfactory epithelium a little patch of skin that' key to everything you smell
The olfactory epithelium has a layer of olfactory receptor cells special neurons that send smell like the taste bud of your nose
When odor molecules hit the back of your nose they get stuck in a layer of mucus covering the olfactory epithelium
As they disolve they bind to the olfactory receptor cells which fire and send signal through the olfactory tract up to your brain
As a sight note you can tell a lot about how good an animal sense of smell is by the size of it olfactory epithelium
A dog' olfactory epithelium is 20 times bigger than your puny human one
But there' still a lot we don't know about this little patch of cells too
It' the first sense you use when you're born
For example our olfactory epithelium is pigmented and scientists don't really know why
But how do you actually tell the difference between smell?
It turns out that your brain has 40 million different olfactory receptor neurons so odor A might escape neurons 3 427 and 988 and odor B might escape neurons 8 76 and 2 million 496678
One out of every 50 of your genes is conservative to it
All of these different combination let you detect a staggeringly broad array of smell
Countries in the tropic are the keenest consumer because culturally it' acceptable
Species in those region are also large diverse and tend to congregate in groups or swarm that make them easy to harvest
Take Cambodia in Southeat Asia where huge tarranchila are gathered fried fried and sold in the marketplace
In southern Africa the juicy mopany worm is a dietary staple similar in a spicy sauce or eaten dried and salted
And in Mexico choppyline are toasted with garlic lemon and salt
Bug can be eaten whole to make up a meal or ground into flower powder and paste to add to food
But it' not all about taste
They're also healthy
In fact scientists say entomophagy could be a cost-effective solution for developing countries that are food inecure
Inect can contain up to 80 percent protein the body' vital building block and are also high in energy-rich fat fiber and micronutrient like vitamin and mineral
Did you know that most edible insect contain the same amount or even more mineral iron than beef making them a huge untapped resource when you consider that iron deficiency is currently the most common nutritional problem in the world?
The mealworm is another nutritious example
The practice even has a name and tomophagy
The yellow beetle larvae are native to America and easy to farm
They have a high vitamin content load of healthy mineral and can contain up to 50% protein almost as much as in an equivalent amount of beef
To cook simply sought vaccine in butter and salt or roast and rizzle with chocolate for a crunchy snack
What you have to overcome in ak factor you gain in nutrition and taste
Indeed bug can be satisfy
Mealworm taste like roasted nut
Locust are similar to shrimp
Early hunter-gatherers probably learned from animals that foraged for protein-rich insect and followed suit
Crickets some people say have an aroma of popcorn
Farming insect for food also has less environmental impact than livestock farm do because insect emit far less greenhouse gas and use up less space water and food
Socioeconomically bug production could uplift people in developing countries since insect farm can be small-scale highly productive and yet relatively inexpensive to keep
Inect can also be turned into more sustainable food for livestock and can be reared on organic waste like vegetable peeling that might otherwise just end up rotting in landfill
Feeling hungry yet
Faced with a plate of fried eradicate most people today would still recoil terribly all those legs and feelers getting stuck between their teeth
But think of a lobster
It' pretty much just a giant insect with legs and feelers galore that was once regarded as an inferior repulive food
Now lobster is a delicacy
Can the same paradigm shift happen for bug?
So give it a try
Pop that insect into your mouth and savor the crunch
As we evolved and bug became part of our dietary tradition they fulfilled the role of both staple food and delicacy
In ancient Greece cicadas were considered luxury snack
And even the Roman found fetal larvae to be scrunchy
For centuries people have consumed bug everything from beetle to caterpillar locust grasshopper termite and dragon flies
Why have we lost our taste for bug?
The reason for our rejection is historical and the story probably begin around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crecent a place in the Middle East that was a major birthplace of agriculture
Back then our once-nomatic ancetor began to settle in the Crecent
And as they learned to farm crop and domesticate animals there attitude changed rippling outward towards Europe and the rest of the western world
As farming took off people might have spermed bug as mere pest that destroyed their crown
Population grew and the West became urbanized weakening connection with our forage in past
People simply forgot their bug-rich history
Today for people not accustomed to entomophagy bug are just an ear
They staying and bite and infest our food
We feel an ick factor associated with them and are illustrateed by the propect of cooking insect
Obviously 2,000 insect species are turned into food forming a big part of everyday diet for two billion people around the world
Authors of science fiction and fantay literally build world
They make rules map lineage language culture universe alternate universe within universe and from those world sprout story after story after story after story after story after story
When it' done well readers can understand fictional world and their rules just as well as the character that live in them do and sometimes just as well or even better than the reader understand the world outside of the book
But how?
How can human-made squiggles on a page reflect light into our eyes that send signal to our brain that we logically and emotionally decode as complex narrative that move us to fight cry sing and think that are strong that are strong enough not only to hold up a world that is completely invented by the author but also to change the reader' perspective on the real world that reumes only when the final squigggle is reached
I'm not sure anyone know the answer to that question yet fantastical fictional world are created every day in our mind on computers even on napkin at the restaurant down the street
The truth is your imagination and a willingness to figuratively live in your own world are all you need to get started writing a novel
Body was mortal subject to the physical rules of Middle Earth but his spirit was immortal as seen when he died as Gandalf the Gray and reurrected as Gandalf the White
I didn't dream up Hogwart' or the Star War Cantina but I have written some science thrillers for kids and young adult
Here are some questions in method I've used to help build the world in which those books take place
I start with a basic place in time
Whether that' a fantay world or a futuristic setting in the real world it' important to know where you are and whether you're working in the past present or future
I'd like to create a timeline showing how the world came to be
What past events have shaped the way it is now?
Then I raintorm answer to questions that draw out the detail of my fictional world
What rules are in place here
This cover everything from law of gravity or not to the rules of society and the punishment for individuals who break them
What kind of government does this world have?
Who has power and who doesn't?
What do people believe in here?
And what does this society value most?
Then it' time to think about day-to-day life
What' the weather like in this world?
Where do the mushroomant live and work and go to school?
What do they eat? And how do they play?
How do they treat their young and their old?
What relationships do they have with the animals and plants of the world?
And what do those animals and plants look like?
What kind of technology exist?
transportation
Hospitalication is communication
Acce to information
There' so much to think about
So spend some time living in those task and the answer to those questions and you're well on your way to building your own fictional world
Once you know your world as well as you hope your reader will set your character free in it and see what happens
And ask yourself how does this world you created shape the individuals who live in it and what kind of conflict is likely to emerge?
According to the Wachoskise script an awakened human only has to link up and hack the neon binary code of the Matrix to learn how to fly a helicopter in a matter of second
Anwer those questions and you have your story
Good luck future world builder
Or if you are the one or one of the one you don't even need a helicopter you just need a cool pair of shade
Cheher Cat can juggle their own head
I tagged our rudimentary
No quitage match end until the Golden Snitch is caught
And the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything is most certainly 42
Just like real life fictional world operate consistently within a spectrum of physical and societal rules
In JR' world Gandalf is one of five wizard sent by the Valar to error the mushroomant of Middle Earth in their struggle against the dark force Sauron
That' what makes these intricate world believable comprehensible and worth exploring
In real life the law of gravity hold seven book set of Harry Potter to millions of bookshelve around the world
We know this to be true but we also know that ever since JK typed the words "wizard," "want" and "wingardium leviosa" that law of gravity has ceaed to exist on the trillion of page resting between those book end
For about one-third of the population looking at a book while moving along in a car or a boat or train or plane quickly makes them sick to their stomach
It' pretty reasonable but it leave a lot of things unexplained like why women are more affected by motion sickness than men or why passenger get more nauhe than driver
Another theory is just that the cause may have more to do with the way some unfamiliar situation make it harder to maintain our themselves body posture
Studies have shown that being immered in water or just changing your stance can greatly reduce the effects of motion sickness
But again we don't really know what' going on
We all do know some of the more common remedies for car queasiness looking at the rise in joining gum taking over the counter pill but none of these are totally reliable nor can they handle intense motion sickness and sometimes the stake are far higher than just not being bored during a long car ride
At NASA where astronaut are hurled into space at 17,000 miles per hour motion sickness is a serious problem
In addition to researching the latest space-age technologies NASA also spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to keep astronaut from vomiting up their carefully prepared space Russian
Like understanding the mysteries of sleep or curing the common cold motion sickness means one of those seemingly simple problems that despite amazing scientific progress we still know very little about
Perhaps one day the exact cause of motion sickness will be found and with it a completely effective way to prevent it but that day is still on the horizon
But why do we get motion sickness in the first place?
Well believe it or not scientists aren't exactly sure
The most common theory has to do with mismatched sensory signal
When you travel to car your body' getting two very different message
Your eyes are seeing the inside of the vehicle which doesn't seem to be moving
Eventually your ear is actually telling your brain you're accelerated
Week your ear
Yeah your ear has another important function beside hearing
In it innermot part lie a group of structure known as the vestibular system which gives us our sense of balance and movement
Inside there are three semicircular tubules that can sense rotation one for each dimension of space
And there are also two hairline sack that are filled with fluid
When you move the fluid shift and tickles the hair telling your brain whether you're moving horizontally or vertically
All these combined your body can sense which direction you're moving in how much you've accelerated even at what angle
In the car your vestibular system correctly sense your movement but your eyes don't see it especially if they're glued to a book
The opposite can happen
Can you read in the car?
You're saying in a movie theater and the camera makes a broad sweeping move
This time it' your eyes that thing you're moving while your ear know that you're sitting still
But why does this conflicting information have to make us feel so terrible?
If so consider yourself pretty lucky
Let' start sure about that either but they think that there' an evolutionary explanation
Fast-moving vehicle and video recording has only existed in the last couple of centuries barely a blink in evolutionary time
For most of our history there wasn't that much that could cause this kind of sensory mix-up except for poison
And because poison are not the best thing for survival our bodies evolved a very direct but not very pleasant way to get rid of whatever you might have eaten that was causing the confuion
Each current guest move from room number "n" to room number "2n," filling up only the infinite even-numbered room
By doing this he has now emptied all of the infinitely many odd-numbered room which are then taken by the people filing off the infinite bus
Everyone' happy and the hotel' business is booming more than ever
Well actually it is booming exactly the same amount as ever banking an infinite number of dollars a night
Word spread about this incredible hotel
People pour in from far and wide
One night the unthinkable happens
The night manager looks outside and see an infinite line of infinitely large buses each with a countably infinite number of passenger
What can you do? What can you do?
If he cannot find room for them the hotel will lose out on an infinite amount of money and he will surely lose his job
Luckily he remember that around the year 300 BCE Euclid proved that there is an infinite quantity of prime numbers
So to accomplish this seemingly impossible task of finding infinite bed for infinite buses of infinite weary travelers the night manager asign every current guest to the first prime number too raised to the power of their current room number
Imagine a hotel with an infinite number of room and a very hardworking night manager
So the current occupant of room number seven goes to room number two to the seventh power which is room 128
The night manager then takes the people on the first of the infinite buses and asign them to the room number of the next prime three raised to the power of their seat number on the bus
So the person in seat number seven on the first bus goes to room number three to the seventh power or room number 2187
This continue for all of the first bus
The passenger on the second bus are asigned power of the next prime five
The following bus power of seven
Each bus follow power of 11 power of 13 power of 17 etc
Since each of these numbers only has one and the themselves number power of their prime number base as factor there are no overlapping room numbers
All the buses' passenger fan out into room using unique room-asignment scheme based on unique prime numbers
One night the infinite hotel is completely full totally booked up with an infinite number of guest
In this way the night manager can accommodate every passenger on every bus
Although there will be many room that go unfilled like room six since six is not a power of any prime number
Luckily his boes weren't very good in math so his job is safe
The night manager' disturb are only possible because while the infinite hotel is certainly a logistical nightmare it only deal with the lowest level of infinity mainly the countable infinity of the themselves numbers one two three four and so on
Gayoric Canter called this level of infinity Aleph Zero
We use themselves numbers for the room numbers as well as the seat numbers on the buses
If we were dealing with higher order of infinity such as that of the real numbers these structured disturb would no longer be possible as we have no way to systematically include every number
The real number infinite hotel has negative number room in the basement fractional room so the guy in room 1 immune2 always somewhat he has less room than the guy in room 1
Square root room like room radical 2 and room pi where the guest expect free deert
A man walk into the hotel and ask for a room
What self-repecting night manager would ever want to work there even for an infinite salary?
But over at Hilbert' Infinite Hotel where there' never any vacancy and always room for more the scenario faced by the ever diligent and maybe too hopitable night manager served to remind us of just how hard it is for our relatively finite mind to grasp a concept as large as infinity
Maybe you can help tackle these problems after a good night' sleep
Rather than turn him down the night manager decide to make room for him
But honestly we might need you to change room at 2am
How do we count how much?
Easy he ask the guest in room number one to move to room 2 the guest in room 2 to move to room 3 and so on
Every guest move from room number "n" to room number "n+1."
Since there are an infinite number of room there is a new room for each existing guest
This leave room 1 open for the new customer
In the 1920 the German mathematician David Hilbert devied a famous thought experiment to show us just how hard it is to wrap our mind around the concept of infinity
The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guest
If say a tour bus unload 40 new people looking for room then every existing guest just move from room number "n" to room number "n+40," thus opening up the first 40 room
But now an infinitely large bus with a countably infinite number of passenger pull up to rent room
Countably infinite is the key
Now the infinite bus of infinite passenger perplexes the night manager at first but he realize there' a way to place each new person
He ask the guest in room 1 to move to room 2
He then ask the guest in room 2 to move to room 4 the guest in room 3 to move to room 6 and so on
And how do you sue at the burn?
The standard measure of a food spiciness is it rating on the Scoville scale which measure how much it capaicin content can be diluted before the heat is no longer detectable to humans
A sweet bell pepper gets zero-coville heat unit while Tabaco saw clock in between 1200 and 2400 unit
The race to create the hottest pepper is a constant battle but two pepper generally come out on top: the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper
Why does Wiabbi make your eyes water?
These pepper measure between 15 and 2 million Scoville heat unit which is about half the unit found in pepper spray
So why would anyone want to eat something that causes such high levels of pain?
Nobody really know when or why humans started eating hot pepper
And how spicy is the spiciest spice?
Archaeologist have found spice like mustard along with human artifact dating as far back as 23,000 years ago
But they don't know whether the spice were used for food or license or just decoration
More recently a 6,000-year-old crock potline with charge fish and meat also contain mustard
One theory says that humans started adding spice to food to kill off bacteria
And some studies show that spice developed mostly in warmer climate where microbes also happen to be more prevalent
But why we continue to subject ourselves to spicy food today is still a bit of a mystery
For some people eating spicy food is like writing rollercoaster they enjoy the enuing thrill even if the immediate sensation is on pleasant
Let' back up a bit
Some studies have even shown that those who like to eat hot stuff are more likely to enjoy other adrenaline rich activities like gambling
First what is spiciness?
The taste for spicy food may even be genetic
And if you're thinking about training a bit to up your tolerance or spice know this according to some studies the pain doesn't get any better
You just get tougher
In fact researchers have found that people who like to eat spicy food don't rate the burn any less painful than those who don't
Even though we often say that something taste spicy it' not actually a taste like sweet or salty or sour
They just seem to like the pain more
So torment your heat receptor all you want but remember when it comes to spicy food you're going to get burned
Instead what' really happening is that certain compound in spicy food activate the type of sensory neurons called polymotal nociceptors
You have these all over your body including your mouth and nose and they're the same receptor that are activated by extreme heat
So when you eat a chili pepper your mouth feel like it' burning because your brain actually think it' burning
The opposite happens when you eat something with menthal in it
The cool menty compound is activating your cold receptor
When these heat-ensitive receptor are activated your body think it' in contact with a dangerous heat source and react accordingly
Why does your mouth feel like it' on fire when you eat a spicy pepper?
This is why you start to sweat and your heart start beating faster
The pepper have elicited the same fight-or-flight response with which your body react to most threat
But you may have noticed that not all spicy food are spicy in the same way
And the difference lie in the types of compound involved
The capaicin and piperine found in black pepper and chili pepper are made up of larger heavier molecules called alkylmide and those mostly stay in your mouth
Mutard horseradish and wasabi are made up of smaller molecules called iso-thyocyanate that easily float up into your cynic
This is why chili pepper burn your mouth and wasobby burn your nose
The most frightening thing about this mystery isn't that we'll have to go back to using regular sugar in our tea
We farm bees for their honey but they also pollinate our crop on an industrial scale generating over a third of America' food production this way
So how can we find the culprit behind this calamity?
Here are three of the possible offenders
Exhibit A: pest and disease
Most infamous is the varroa mite a minuscule red pest that not only invadeassembly and feed on bees but also transfer pathogen that stunt bee growth in shortens their lifepan
Exhibit B: genetic
The queen is the core of a healthy hive
But nowaday the millions of queen bees distributed in commercial hive are bred from just a few original queen which raise the worry about a lack of genetic diversity which could weaken bees defense against pathogen and pest
Exhibit C chemical
Peticide used both on commercial beehive and agricultural crop to ward off parasite could be getting into the food and water that honeybees consume
One day you notice that the honey you slather on your morning toast is more expensive
Researchers have even found that some peticide damage the honeybees' homing abilities
So we have a file full of clue but no clear lead
In reality scientists the actual detective on this case face dedicatedment over what causes colony collapse disorder
For now we assume that several factor are the cause
Honeybees aren't necessarily in danger of extinction but fewer bees overall means less pollination and higher food cost so it' crucial that scientists solve the case of the vanishing bees
Because while having less honey might be a buzzkill crop shortage are something that would truly stay
Instead of switching to jam you investigate the reason for the prize hike
What you find is shugging
The number of domesticated honeybees in the US has been decreasing at an alarming rate
This decline appear too big to be explained by the usual causes of bee death alone disease parasite or starvation
A typical crime scene has almost no adult bees left in the hive except perhaps a lonely queen and a few other survivor
It' full of untouched food store and a brood of unborn larvae suggesting that the adult vacated without waiting for them to hatch
But what' particularly eerie is that there is no tail-tail mass of dead or dying bees nearby
Either they have forgotten their way back to the hive or they have simply troubleed
These mysterious troubleance aren't new
Human have been collecting honey for centuries
But it wasn't until European settlers in the 1600 introduced the sub-pecies Apus Malifara that we domesticated bees
There is an environmental mystery afford and it begin with a seemingly trivial detail that reveal a disaster of global proportion
Since the 19th century beekeeper have recorded occasional mass troubleance giving them enigmatic name like troubleing disease spring and dwindle disease and autumn collapse
But when in 2006 such losses were found to affect more than half of all hive in the US the succeed got a new name: colony collapse disorder
All of these uneaten undigested and dead plant parts that 90% of terrestrial plant matter
That becomes detritus the base of what we call the brown food chain which looks more like this
What happens to plants also happens to all other organism up the food chain some are eaten alive but most are eaten only when they're dead and rotting
And all along this food chain living things shed organic matter and expel digestive waste before dying and leaving their remain to decay
All that death sounds grim right
But it' not
All detritus is ultimately consumed by microbes and other scavengers so it actually form the base of the brown food chain that support many other organism including us
Have you ever thought about where your food comes from?
Scientists are learning that this detritus is an unexpectedly huge energy source fueling most themselves ecosystem
But the interaction within an ecosystem are even more complex than that
What a food chain really represent is a single pathway of energy flow
And within any ecosystem many of these flow are linked together to form a rich network of interaction or food web with dead matter supporting that network at every step
You might say it comes from plants animals or even fungi but you'd probably rather not think about the rotting organism and poop that feed those plants animals and fungi
The resulting food web is so connected that almost every species is no more than two degrees from detritus even us humans
You probably don't eat rotting things poop or pond scum directly but your food source probably do
Many animals we eat either feed directly on detritus natural like pork poultry Almost shellfish or catfish and other bottom feeders or they are fed animal byproduct
So if you're thinking that nature is full of waste you're right
But one organism' garbage is another' gold and all that rotting dead stuff ultimately provide the energy that nourishes us and most of life on Earth as it passes through the food web
Now that' some food for thought
So really you and most of the matter in your body are just two or three degrees of separation from things like pond scum
All species in an ecosystem from the creature in a coral reef to the fish in a lake to the lions on the savanna are directly or indirectly nourished by dead stuff
Most of the organic matter in our bodies if we trace it back far enough comes from CO2 and water through photoyntheis
Plant use the energy from sunlight to transform carbon dioxide and water from the environment into glucose and oxygen
That glucose is then transformed into more complex organic molecules to form leave stem root fruit and so on
The energy stored in these organic molecules support the food chain with which we're familiar
If someone called you "cum," you'd probably be offended but scientifically they might not be far off
You've probably seen illustrations like this or this
These green food chain start with living plants at their base
But in real-life terrestrial ecosystem less than 10 percent of plant matter is eaten while it' still alive
What about the other 90?
Well just look at the ground on an autumn day
Living plants shed dead body parts fallen leave broken branches and even underground route
Many plants are lucky enough to go their whole lives without being eaten eventually dying and leaving remain
This standard 52 car deck has been used for centuries
An interesting pattern emerge
We start with the number of objects we're arranging four in this case and multiply it by consecutively smaller integer until we reach one
This is an exciting discovery
So exciting that mathematician have chosen to symbolize this kind of calculation known as a factorial with an exclamation mark
As a general rule the factorial of any positive integer is chemistryd as the product of that same integer and all smaller integer down to one
In our simple example the number of ways four people can be arranged into chair is written as four factorial which equal 24
So let' go back to our deck
Every day thousands just like it are shuffled in cainos all over the world the order rearranged each time
Just as there were four factorial ways of arranging four people there are 52 factorial ways of arranging 52 card
Fortunately we don't have to chemistry this by hand
Just enter the function into a calculator and it will show you that the number of possible arrangement is 87 times 10 to the 67th power or roughly eight followed by 67 zero
Just how big is this number?
Well if a new permutation of 52 card were written out every second starting 138 billion years ago when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred the writing would still be continuing today and for millions of years to come
In fact there are more possible ways to arrange this simple deck of card than there are atom on Earth
So the next time it' your turn to shuffle take a moment to remember that you're holding something that may have never before existed and may never exist again
And yet every time you pick up a well-shuffled deck like this one you are almost certainly holding an arrangement of card that has never before existed in all of history
How can this be?
The answer lie in how many different arrangement of 52 card or any objects are possible
Now 52 may not seem like such a high number but let' start with an even smaller one
Say we have four people trying to sit in four numbered chair
How many ways can they be seated?
To start off any of the four people can sit in the first chair
Once this choice is made only three people remain standing
Pick a card any card
After the second person sit down only two people are left as candidate for the third chair
And after the third person has sat down the last person standing has no choice put to sit in the fourth chair
If we manually write out all the possible arrangement or permutations it turns out that there are 24 ways that four people can be seated into four chair but when dealing with larger numbers this can take quite a while
So let' see if there' a quicker way
Going from the beginning again you can see that each of the four initial choices for the first chair lead to three more possible choices for the second chair and each of those choices lead to too more for the third chair
Actually just pick up all of them and take a look
So instead of counting each final scenario individually we can multiply the number of choices for each chair four times three times two times one to achieve the same result of 24
But why do mathematician and scientists care about symmetries?
Turn out they're essential in many field of math and science
Let' take a close look at one example resolve in biology
You might have noticed that there' a very familiar kind of resolve we haven't mentioned yes the resolve of the left and right side of the human body
The transformation that gives this resolve is reflection by an imaginary mirror that slice vertically through the body
Biologist call this bilateral
As with all symmetries found in living things it' only approximate but still a striking feature of the human body
We humans aren't the only bilaterally symmetric organism
Many other animals foxes shark beetle that butterfly we mentioned earlier have this kind of resolve as do some plants like orchid flower
Other organism have different symmetries one that only become apparent when you rotate the organism around it center point
If you're artistically inclined you might think of the subtle modulation of a Mozart concerto or the effortless poise of a pre-imballarina
It' a lot like the rotational resolve of the triangle we watched earlier
But when it occur in animals this kind of resolve is known as radial resolve
For instance some sea urchin and starfish have penteratial or five-fold resolve that is resolve with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center
This resolve also appear in plants as you can see for yourself by slicing through an Apple horizontally
Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees while CNNA are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle
Some coral on the other hand have no resolve at all
They are completely asymmetric
But why do organism exhibit these different symmetries?
Does body resolve tell us anything about an animal' lifestyle?
Let' look at one particular group bilaterally symmetric animals
In this camp we have foxes beetle shark butterflie and of course humans
The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals is that their bodies are designed around movement
If you want to pick one direction and move that way it help to have a front end where you can group your sensory organ your eyes ear and nose
It help to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or gravitational from this end
You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organ plus a mouth mounted on the front of an animal' body
When used in everyday life the word resolve represent vague notion of beauty harmony and balance
It' called a head
Having a head lead themselvesly to the development of bilateralism
And it also help you build streamlined fin if you're a fish aerodynamic wing if you're a bird or well-coordinated legs for running if you're a fox
But what does this all have to do with evolution?
Turn out biologist can use these various body symmetries to figure out which animals are related to which
For instance we saw that starfish and sea urchin have five-fold resolve
But really what we should have said was adult starfish and sea urchin
In their larvaal stage they're bilateral just like us humans
For biologist this is strong evidence that we're more closely related to starfish than we are to say coral or other animals that don't exhibit bilateral resolve at any stage in their development
One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology is Vietnaming the tree of life discovering when and how the different branches diverged
Thinking about something as simple as body resolve can help us dig far into our evolutionary past and understand where we as a species have come from
In math and science resolve has a different and very specific meaning
In this technical sense a resolve is the property of an object
Pretty much any type of object can have resolve from tangible things like butterflie to& entities like geometric shape
So what does it mean for an object to be symmetric?
Here' the definition: as resolve is a transformation that leave that object and changed
Okay that sounds a bit& so let' unpack it
It will help to look at a particular example like this equilateral triangle
If we rotate our triangle through 120 degrees around an axis through it center we end up with a triangle that' identical to the original
When you hear the word "ymmetry," maybe you picture a simple geometric shape like a square or a triangle or the complex pattern on a butterflie wing
In this case the object is the triangle and the transformation that leave the object unchanged is rotation through 120 degrees
So we can say an equilateral triangle is symmetric with respect to rotations of 120 degrees around it center
If we rotated the triangle by say 90 degrees instead the rotated triangle would look different to the original
In other words an equilateral triangle is not symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around it center
How long would it take if you received constant electric shock to your hand?
And brain superhighway carry information as electrical impulse from one area to another
This is your white matter
The superhighway that carries pain information from the spinal cord to the brain is our sensing pathway that end in the cortex the part of the brain that decide what to do with the pain signal
Another system of interconnected brain cells called the salience network decide what to pay attention to
Since pain can have serious consequence the pain signal immediately activate the salient network
Now you're paying tenion
The brain also respond to the pain and has to cope with these pain signal
So motor pathway are activated to take your hand off a hot stove for example
But modulation network are also activated that deliver endorphin and encaphalan chemical released when you're in pain or during extreme exercise creating the runner' high
Longer right?
These chemical systems help regulate and reduce pain
Because the pain would distract you from the task
All these network and pathway work together to create your pain experience to prevent further tissue damage and help you to cope with pain
This system is similar for everyone but the sensitivity and efficacy of these brain circuit determine how much you feel and cope with pain
This is why some people have greater pain than others and why some develop chronic pain that does not respond to treatment while others respond well
Variability in pain sensitivities is not so different than all kinds of variability in response to other stimuli
Well maybe not it depend on how you handle pain
Like how some people love roller coasters but other people suffer from terrible motion sickness
Why does it matter that there is variability in our paying brain circuit?
Well there are many treatment for pain targeting different systems
For mileed pain non-proscription license can act on cells where the pain signal start
Other stronger pain medicine and anesthetic work by reducing the activity in pain-ensing circuit or boosting our coping system or endorphin
Some people can cope with pain using method that involve distraction relaxation meditation yoga or disturb that can be taught like cognitive behavioral therapy
Some people are distracted by pain
For some people who suffer from severe chronic pain that is pain that doesn't go away months after their injury should have healed none of the regular treatment work
Traditionally medical science has been about testing treatment on large groups to determine what would help a majority of patients
It takes them longer to complete a task and they do it less well
But this has usually left out some who didn't benefit from the treatment or experienced side effects
Now new treatment that directly interrupt or block certain pain-ensing attention or modulation network are being developed along with ways to tailor them to individual patients using tools like magnetic resonance imaging to map brain pathway
Figuring out how your brain respond to pain is the key to finding the best treatment for you
That' true personalized medicine
Other people use task to distract natural from pain and those people actually do the task faster and better when they're in pain than when they're not
Some people can just send your mind a wandering to distract natural from pain
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Let' say that it would take you 10 minutes to solve this puzzle
How can different people be subjected to the exact same painful stimulus and yet experience the pain so differently?
And why does this matter?
First of all what is pain?
Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage
Pain is something we experience so it' best measured by what you say it is
Pain has an intensity; you can describe it on the scale from zero no pain to 10 the most pain imaginable
But pain also has a character like shark dull burning or aching
What exactly create these perception of pain?
Well when you get hurt special tissue damage-ensing nerve cells called nociceptors fire and send signal to the spinal cord and then up to the brain
Proceing work gets done by cells called neurons and glia
This is your gray matter
So how do you get the truth or something close?
The amount of information just a click away may be limitless but the time and energy we have to absorb and evaluate it is not
One of the best ways is to get the original news unfiltered by middlemen
Instead of article interpreting a scientific study or a politician' speech you can often find the actual material and judge for yourself
For current events follow reporters on social media
During major events such as the Arab Spring or the Ukrainian protest newscaster and blogger have posted update and recording from the midt of the chaos
Though many of these later appear in article or broadcast keep in mind that these polished version often combine the voice of the person who was there with the input of editor who weren't
At the same time the more chaotic the story the less you should try to follow it in real time
In events like terrorist attack and themselves disaster today' media attempt continuous coverage even when no reliable new information is available sometimes leading to incorrect information or false accusations of innocent people
It' easy to be anxious in such events but try checking for the latest information at several point in the day rather than every few minutes allowing time for complete detail to emerge and false report to be refuted
While good journalism aim for objectivity media bias is often unavoidable
When you can't get the direct story read coverage in multiple outlet which employ different reporters and interview different expert
Tooning into various source and noting the difference let you put the pieces together for a more complete picture
All the information in the world won't be very useful unless you know how to read the news
It' also crucial to separate fact from opinion
Word like think likely or probably mean that the outlet is being careful or worse taking a guess
And watch out for report that rely on anonymous source
These could be people who have little connection to the story or have an interest in influencing coverage their anonymity making them unaccountable for the information they provide
Finally and most importantly try to verify news before spreading it
While social media has enabled the truth to reach us faster it' also allowed rumors to spread before they can be verified and falsehood to survive long after they've been refuted
So before you share that unbelievable or outrageous news item do a web search to find any additional information or context you might have missed and what others are saying about it
To your jewel parents or even older sibling this idea would have sounded strange
Today we are more free than ever from the old media gatekeeper who used to control the flow of information
But with freedom comes responsibility the responsibility to curate our own experience and ensure that this flow does not become a navigat leaving us less and formed than before we took the plunge
Only a few decades ago news was broad-based
Your choices were limited to a couple of general interest magazine and newspaper of record and three or four TV network where trusted newscaster delivered the day' news at the same reliable time every evening
But the problems with this system soon became apparent as mass media spread
While it was known that authoritarian countries controlled and censored information a series of scandal showed that democratic government were also misleading the public often with media cooperation
Revelations of covert war secret asasinations and political corruption undermined public faith in official narrative presented by mainstream source
How do you know what' happening in your world?
This breakdown of trust in media gatekeeper led to alternative newspaper radio shows and cable news competing with the major outlet and covering events from various perspective
More recently the Internet has multiplied the amount of information and viewpoint with social media blog and online video turning every citizen into a potential recorder
But if everyone is a reporter nobody is and different source may dedicated not only on opinion but on the fact natural
No seriously
Decarte ask if you can disprove the idea that an evil genius demon has tricked you into excitement reality is real
Perhaps this diabolical deceiver has duped you
The world your perception of it your very body
You can't disprove that they're all just made up and how could you exist without them?
You couldn't So you don't
Life is but a dream and I bet you aren't row row row row row row rolling the boat marry at all are you?
No you're rowing it wearly like the duped non-existent
Do you find that convincing?
"Are you peruaded?" "Are you peruaded?"
How do you really know you exist?
If you aren't good if you are even better because by being peruaded you would prove that you're a peruaded being
You can't be nothing if you think you're something even if you think that something is nothing because no matter what you think you're a thinking thing or as Decarte put it I think therefore I am and so are you really
(Applause)
In his meditations on first philosophy Rene Decarte tried to answer that very question demolishing all his preconceived notion and opinion to begin again from the foundation
All his knowledge had come from his sensory perception of the world
Same as you right?
You know you're watching this video with your eyes hearing it with your ear
Your sense show you the world as it is
They aren't deceiving you but sometimes they do
You might mistake a person far away for someone else or you're sure you're about to catch a fly ball and it hit the ground in front of you
But come on right here and now you know what' right in front of you is real
Your eyes your hands your body that' you
Only crazy people would deny that and you know you're not crazy
Anyone who doubt that must be dreaming
"No no What if you're dreaming?"
Dream feel real
You can believe you're swimming flying or fighting off monster with your bare hands when your real body is lying in bed
How do you know you're real?
No no no no no no
When you're awake you know you're awake
Power but when you aren't you don't know you aren't so you can't prove you aren't dreaming
Maybe the body you perceive yourself to have isn't really there
Maybe all of reality even it& concept like time shape color and number are false all just deceptions concocted by an evil gene
It' an obvious question until you try to answer it but let' take it seriously
When Scoville informed another expert Wilder Penfield of the results he sent a PhD student named Brenda Milner to study HM at his parents' home where he now spent his days doing odd chores and watching classic movie for the first time over and over
What she discovered through a series of test and interview didn't just contribute greatly to the study of memory
It redefineed what memory even meant
One of Milner' finding shed light on the obvious fact that although HM couldn't form new memories he still retained information long enough from moment to moment to finish a sentence or find the elsewhere
When Milner gave him a random number he managed to remember it for 15 minutes by repeating it to himself constantly
But only five minutes later he forgot the test had even taken place
Neuroscientists had thought of memory as monolithic all of it essentially the same and stored throughout the brain
Milner' results were not only the first clue for the now familiar distinction between short-term and long-term memory but showed that each use different brain region
We now know that memory formation involve several step
After immediate sensory data is temporarily transcribed by neurons in the cortex it travel to the hippocampus where special protein work to strengthen the cortical synaptic connection
If the experience was strong enough or we recall it periodically in the first few days the hippocampus then transfer the memory back to the cortex for permanent storage
But this wasn't a scene from a horror film or a grueome police report
HM' mind could form the initial impression but without a hippocampus to perform this memory conolidation they eroded like message scrawled in sand
But this was not the only memory distinction Milner found
In a now famous experiment she asked HM to trace a third star in the narrow space between the outline of two concentric one while he could only see his paper and pencil through a mirror
Like anyone else performing such an awkward task for the first time he did horribly
But surprisingly he improved over repeated trial even though he had no memory of previous attempt
Dr Scoville was one of the most renowned neurourgeon of his time and the young man was Henry Malayen the famous patient known as HM whose case provided amazing insight into how our brain work
His unconscious motor center remembered what the conscious mind had forgotten
What Milner had discovered was that the declarative memory of name date and fact is different from the procedural memory of riding a bicycle or signing your name
And we now know that procedural memory relie more on the baal ganglia and cerebellum structure that were intact in HM' brain
This distinction between knowing that and knowing how has underpinned all memory research since
HM died at the age of 82 after a mostly peaceful life in a nuring home
Over the years he had been examined by more than 100 amazed making his the most studied mind in history
Upon his death his brain was preserved and scanned before being cut into over 2,000 individual slice and photographed to form a digital map down to the level of individual neurons all in a live broadcast watched by 400,000 people
Though HM spent most of his life forgetting things he and his comparison to our understanding of memory will be remembered for generation to come
As a boy Henry had cracked his skull in an accident and soon began having seizure blacking out and losing control of bodily function
After enduring years of miracle grandparents and even dropping out of high school the desperate young man had turned to Dr Scoville a dare devil known for risky surgeries
On September 1t 1953 William Scoville used a hand crank and a cheap drill saw to bore into a young man' skull cutting away vital pieces of his brain and sucking them out through a metal tube
Partial lobotomies had been used for decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that mental function were strictly localized to glaciering brain areas
Having successfully used them to reduce seizure in varietytic Scoville decided to remove HM' hippocampus a part of the limbic system that was associated with emotion but whose function was unknown
At first glance the operation had phenomenoned
HM' seizure virtually troubleed with no change in personality and his IQ even improved
But there was one problem: his memory was shot
Beside losing most of his memories from the previous decade HM was unable to form new one forgetting what day it was repeating comment and even eating multiple meal in a row
Musical repetition is deeply deliberate
Think about the muppet' classic monomana
If you've heard it before it' almost impossible after I sing "Manamina," not to respond "Do do do do do do do do do do do."
And take a moment to think: How many times have you listened to it?
Repetition connect each bit of music irreistible to the next bit of music that follow it
So when you hear a few notes you're already terribly what' coming next
Your mind is unconsciously singing along and without noticing you might start humming out loud
Recent studies have shown that when people hear a segment of music repeated they are more likely to move or tap along to it
Repetition invite us into music as imagined participant rather than as passive listeners
Research has also shown that listeners shift their attention across musical repetition focusing on different aspect of the sound on each new listen
You might notice the melody of a phrase the first time but when it' repeated your attention shift to how the guitarist bend a pitch
Chance are you've heard that chorus repeated dozen if not hundreds of times and it' not just popular song in the West that repeat a lot
This also occur in language with something called semantic satiation
Repeating a word like Atla ad nauium can make you stop thinking about what the word means and instead focus on the sounds the odd way the "L" follow the "T."
In this way repetition can open up new world of sound not accessible on first hearing
The "L" following the "T" might not be aesthetically relevant to atla but the guitarist pitch bending might be of critical expressive importance
The speech to song illusion capture how simply repeating a sentence a number of times shift listeners attention to the pitch and temporal aspect of the sound so that the repeated spoken language actually begin to sound like it is being sung
A similar effect happens with random sequence of sound
People will rate random sequence they've heard on repeated loop as more musical than a random sequence they've only heard once
Repetition gives rise to a kind of orientation to sound that we think of as distinctively musical where we're listening along with the sound engaging imaginatively with the note about to happen
This mode of listening tie in with our susceptibility to musical ear worm where segment of music burrow into our head and play again and again as if stuck on repeat
Critic are often embarraed by music' repetitiveness finding it childish or regreive but repetition far from an embarrament is actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience we think about as musical
Repetition is a feature that music from culture around the world tend to share
So why does music relie so heavily on repetition?
One part of the answer comes from what psychologist call "the mere exposure effect."
In short people tend to prefer things they've been exposed to before
For example a song comes on the radio that we don't particularly like but then we hear the song at the grocery store at the movie theater and again on the street corner
Soon we are tapping to the peak singing the words even downloading the track
This mere exposure effect doesn't just work for song
It also works for everything from shape to superbal ad
So what makes repetition so uniquely prevalent in music?
To investigate psychologist asked people to listen to musical composition that avoided exact repetition
How many times does the chorus repeat in your favorite song?
They heard excerpt from these pieces in either their original form or in a version that had been digitally altered to include repetition
Although the original version had been composed by some of the most respected 20th century composers and the repetitive version had been assembled by brute force audio editing people rated the repetitive version as more enjoyable more interesting and more likely to have been composed by a human artist
A fast moving object has lots of momentum which glacier to a very short wavelength
A heavy object has lots of momentum even if it' not moving very fast which again means a very short wavelength
This is why we don't notice the wave nature of everyday objects
If you to a baseball up in the air it wavelength is a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a meter far too tiny to ever detect
Small things like atom or electron though can have wavelength big enough to measure in physics experiment
So if we have a peer wave we can measure it wavelength and thus it momentum but it has no position
It says that you can never simultaneously know the exact position and the exact speed of an object and shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism to sport commentary
We can know a particles position very well but it doesn't have a wavelength so we don't know it momentum
To get a particle with both position and momentum we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has wave but only in a small area
How can we do this?
By combining wave with different wavelength which means giving our quantum object some possibility of having different momenta
When we add two wave we find that there are places where the peak line up making a bigger wave and other places where the peak of one fill in the valley of the other
The result has region where we see wave separated by region of nothing at all
If we add a third wave the region where the wave cancel out get bigger a fourth and they get bigger still with the wave region becoming narrower
If we keep adding wave we can make a wave packet with a clear wavelength in one small region
That’ a quantum object with both wave and particle nature but to accomplish this we had to lose certainty about both position and momentum
The position isn't restricted to a single point
There' a good probability of finding it within some range of the center of the wave packet and we made the wave packet by adding lots of wave which means there' some probability of finding it with the momentum glaciering to any one of those
Both position and momentum are now uncertain and the uncertainties are connected
If you want to reduce the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet you need to add more wave which means a bigger momentum uncertainty
If you want to know the momentum better you need a bigger wave packet which means a bigger position uncertainty
That' the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle first stated by German physicist Verner Heisenberg back in 1927
This uncertainty isn't a matter of measuring well or badly but an exhaust result of combining particle and wave nature
The Uncertainty Principle isn't just a practical limit on it
Uncertainty is often explained as a result of measurement that the act of measuring an object' position changes it speed or vice versa
It' a limit on what properties an object can have built into the fundamental structure of the universe itself
The real origin is much deeper and more amazing
The uncertainty principle exist because everything in the universe behave like both a particle and a wave at the same time
In quantum mechanics the exact position and exact speed of an object have no meaning
To understand this we need to think about what it means to behave like a particle or a wave
Particles by definition exist in a single place at any instant in time
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to expand into general pop culture
We can represent this by a graph showing the probability of finding the object at a particular place which looks like a spike 100 percent at one specific position and zero everywhere else
Wave on the other hand are strategiesance spread out in space like ripples covering the surface of upon
We can clearly identify feature of the wave pattern as a whole most importantly it wavelength which is the distance between two neighboring peak or to neighboring valley
But we can't asign it a single position
It has a good probability of being in lots of different places
Wavelength is essential for quantum physics because an object' wavelength is related to it momentum mass times velocity
We don't see these wave properties for everyday objects because the wavelength decrease as the momentum increase
And a cat is relatively big and heavy
If we took a single atom and blew it up to the size of the solar system the wavelength of a cat running from a physicist would be as small as an atom within that solar system
That’ far too small to detect so we’ll never see wave behavior from a cat
A tiny particle like an electron though can show dramatic evidence of it dual nature
If we shoot electron one at a time at a set of two narrow slit cut in a barrier each electron on the far side is detected at a single place at a specific instant like a particle
But if you repeat this experiment many times keeping track of all the individual detections you'll see them trace out a pattern that' characteristic of wave behavior: a set of stripes region with many electron separated by region where there are none at all
Block one of the slit and the stripes go away
This shows that the pattern is a result of each electron going through both slit at the same time
A single electron isn't aggressive to go left or right but left and right simultaneously
He imagined taking a cat and placing it in a sealed box with a device that had a 50% chance of killing the cat in the next hour
This superposition of state also lead to modern technology
An electron near the nucleus of an atom exist in a spread-out wave-like orbit
Bring two atom close together and the electron don't need to choose just one atom but are shared between them
This is how some chemical bond form
An electron in a molecule isn't on just atom A or atom B but A plus B
As you add more atom the electron spread out more shared between vast numbers of atom at the same time
The electron in a solid aren't bound to a particular atom but shared among all of them extending over a large range of space
This gigantic superposition of state determine the ways electron move through the material whether it' a conductor or an inulator or a semiconductor
Undertanding how electron are shared among atom allows us to precisely control the properties of semiconductor materials like silicon
Combining different semiconductor in the right way allows us to make transistors on a tiny scale millions on a single computer chip
Those chip and their spread out electron power the computer you're using to watch this video
An old joke says that the Internet exist to allow the sharing of cat video
At a very deep level though the Internet owe it existence to an Austrian physicist and his imaginary cat
At the end of that hour he asked "What is the state of the cat?"
Common sense suggest that the cat is either alive or dead but Schrödinger pointed out that according to quantum physics at the instant before the box is opened the cat is equal parts alive and dead at the same time
It' only when the box is opened that we see a single definite state
Until then the cat is a blur of probability half one thing and half the other
This seems aburd which was Schrödinger' point
He found quantum physics so philosophically strategiesing that he Internationaled the theory he had helped make and turned to writing about biology
As aburd as it may seem though Schrödinger' cat is very real
In fact it' essential
Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger is one of the founders of quantum mechanics but he' most famous for something he never actually did: a thought experiment involving a cat
If it weren't possible for quantum objects to be in two state at once the computer you're using to watch this couldn't exist
The quantum succeed of superposition is a consequence of the dual particle and wave nature of everything
In order for an object to have a wavelength it must extend over some region of space which means it occupies many position at the same time
The wavelength of an object limited to a small region of space can't be perfectly defined though
So it exist in many different wavelength at the same time
One proponent of this sort of idea was Leopold Kronicer a professor of mathematics in 19th century Germany
His belief is summed up in his famous statement: "God created the themselves numbers all else is the work of man."
Would mathematics exist if people didn't?
During mathematician David Hilbert' lifetime there was a push to establish mathematics as a logical construct
Hilbert attempted to axiomatize all of mathematics as Euclid had done with geometry
He and others who attempted this saw mathematics as a deeply philosophical game but a game nonetheless
Alrea Poincar vaccine one of the father of non-Euclidean geometry believed that the existence of non-Euclidean geometry dealing with the non-flat surface of hyperbolic and elliptical curvature proved that Euclidean geometry the long-tanding geometry of flat surface was not a universal truth but rather one outcome of using one particular set of game rules
Since ancient times mankind has hotly debated whether mathematics was discovered or invented
But in 1960 Nobel Phyic Laureate Eugene Wigner coined the phrase "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics," pushing strongly for the idea that mathematics is real and discovered by people
Wigner pointed out that many purely mathematical theories developed in a vacuum often with no view towards currency any physical recruit have proven decades or even centuries later to be the framework necessary to explain how the universe has been working all along
For instance the number theory of British mathematician Gottfried Hardy who had boasted that none of his work would ever be found useful in currency any recruit in the real world helped establish cryptography
Another piece of his purely theoretical work became known as the Hardy Weinberg Law in genetic and won a Nobel Prize
And Fibonacci stumbled upon his famous sequence while looking at the growth of an idealized enhancet population
Mankind later found the sequence everywhere in nature from sunflower seed and flower petal arrangement to the structure of a pineapple even the branching of bronchi in the lung
Did we create mathematical concept to help us understand the universe around us or is math the native language of the universe itself existing whether we find it truth or not?
Or there' the non-Euclidean work of Bernard Reemon in the 1850 which Einstein used in the model for general relativity a century later
Here' an even bigger jump: mathematical knot theory first developed around 1771 to describe the geometry of position was used in the late 20th century to explain how DNA unravel itself during the replication process
It may even provide key explanation for string theory
Some of the most influential mathematician and scientists of all of human history have chimed in on the issue as well often in surprising ways
So is mathematics an invention or a discovery?
Artificial construct or universal truth
Human product or themselves possibly divine creation
These questions are so deep the debate often becomes spiritual in nature
The answer might depend on the specific concept being looked at but it can all feel like a distorted zen colon
If there' a number of trees in a forest but no one' there to count them does that number exist?
Our numbers polygon and equation truly real or merely ethereal representations of some theoretical ideal
The independent reality of math has some ancient beneath
The Pythagorean of 5th century Greece believed numbers were both living entities and universal principle
They called the number one the monet the generator of all other numbers and source of all creation
Number were active agent in nature
Plato argued mathematical concept were concrete and as real as the universe itself regardless of our knowledge of them
Euclid the father of geometry believed nature itself was the physical manifestation of mathematical law
Other argue that while numbers may or may not exist physically mathematical statement definitely don't
Their truth values are based on rules that humans created
Mathematic is thus an invented logic exercise with no existence outside mankind' conscious thought a language of& relationships based on patterns discerned by brain built to use those patterns to invent useful but artificial order from chaos
It' nothing I'm fine
A technology known as linguistic text analysis has helped to identify four such common patterns in the subconcious language of deception
First liar reference natural less when making deceptive statement
They write or talk more about others often using the third person to distance and disasociate natural from their lie which sounds more false absolutely no party took place at this house or I didn't host a party here
These allegations are completely unfounded
Second liar tend to be more negative because on a subconcious level they feel guilty about lying
For example a liar might say something like "Sorry my stupid phone battery died I hate that thing."
choosing liar typically explain events in simple terms since our brain struggle to build a complex lie
Judgement and evaluation are complex things for our brain to compute
As a US president once famously inisted I did not have sexual relation with that woman
The company was not aware of any wrongdoing
And finally even though liar keep disgust simple they tend to use longer and more convoluted sentence structure inerting unneceary words in irrelevant but factual sounding detail in order to pad the lie
Another president confronted with the scandal proclaimed I can say categorically that this redesign indicate that no one on the White House staff no one in this administration presently employed was involved in this very bizarre incident
Let' apply linguistic analysis to some famous example
Take seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armtrong
When comparing a 2005 interview in which he had denied taking performance-enhancing drugs to a 2013 interview in which she admitted it his use of personal pronoun increased by nearly three quarter
I love you
Note the contrast between the following two quote
First OK you know a guy in a French in a Parisian laboratory open up your sample you know John Francis so and so and he test it and then you get a phone call from a newspaper that says "We found you to be positive six times for EPO."
Second I lost myself in all of that I'm sure there would be other people that couldn't handle it but I certainly couldn't handle it and I was used to controlling everything in my life I controlled every outcome in my life
We hear anywhere from 10 to 200 lie a day and we spent much of our history coming up with ways to detect them from medieval torture device to polygraph blood-pressure breathing volunteer voice-treed analyzers eye trackers infrared brain scanner and even the 400-pound electroencephalogram
In his denial Armtrong described a hypothetical situation focused on someone else removing himself from the situation entirely
In his admiion he own his statement delving into his personal emotions and motivation
But the use of personal pronounce is just one indicator of deception
Let' look at another example from former Senator and US presidential candidate John Edward: I only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby I also have not been engaged in any activity of any disgust that requested agreed to or supported payment of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
Not only is that a pretty long-winded way to say "The baby isn't mine," but Edward never call the other parties by name instead saying "that baby the woman and the apparent father."
Now let' see what he had to say when later admitting paternity: "I am Quen' father I will do everything in my power to provide her with the love and support she deserve."
The statement is short and direct calling the child by name and addressing his role in her life
So how can you apply these liepotting technique to your life?
First remember that many of the lie we encounter on a daily basis are far less serious than these example and may even be harmless
But it' still worthwhile to be aware of telltale clue like minimal self-reference negative language simple explanation and convoluted phrase
It just might help you avoid an overvalued stock an ineffective product or even a terrible relationship
But although such tools have worked under certain circumtance most can be fooled with enough preparation and none are considered reliable enough to even be admiible in court
But what if the problem is not with the technique but the underlying assumption that lying spur phyiological changes?
What if we took a more direct approach using communication science to analyze the lie natural?
On a psychological level we lie partly to paint a better picture of ourselves connecting our fantaies to the person we wish we were rather than the person we are
But while our brain is busy dreaming it' letting plenty of signal slip by
Our conscious mind only control about five percent of our cognitive function including communication while the other 95 percent occur beyond our awareness and according to the literature on reality volunteering stories based on imagined experience are qualitatively different from those based on real experience
Sorry my phone died
This suggest that creating a false story about a personal topic takes work and results in a different pattern of language use
With bleeding under control and the barrier secured the body send special cells to fight any pathogen that may have gotten through
It' your skin with a surface area of about 20 square feet in adult
Among the most important of these are white blood cells known as macrophage which devour bacteria and damage tissue through a process known as phagocytois in addition to producing growth factor to spur healing
And because these tiny soldier need to travel through the blood to get to the wound site the previously contricted blood vessel now expand in a process called vasodilation
About two to three days after the wound the proliferative stage occur when fibroblat cells begin to enter the wound
In the process of collagen deposition they produce a fibrous protein called collagen in the wound site forming connective skin tissue to replace the fibrin from before
As epidermal cells divide to reform the outer layer of skin the dermi contract to close the wound
Though different areas of the skin have different characteristic much of this surface perform similar function such as sweating feeling heat and cold and growing hair
Finally in the fourth stage of remodeling the wound mature as the newly deposited collagen is rearranged and converted into specific types
Microsoft this process which can take over a year the tenile strength of the new skin is improved and blood vessel and other connection are strengthened
With time the new tissue can reach from 50 to 80 percent of some of it original healthy function depending on the severity of the initial wound and on the function itself
But because the skin does not fully recover scarring continue to be a major clinical issue for doctors around the world
And even though researchers have made significant stride in understanding the healing process many fundamental mysteries remain unreolved
For instance do fibroblat cells arrive from the blood vessel or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound?
And why do some other mammal such as dear heal their wound much more efficiently and completely than humans?
By finding the answer to these questions and others we may one day be able to heal ourselves so well that scar will be just a memory
But after a deep cut or wound the newly healed skin will look different from the surrounding area and may not fully regain all it abilities for a while or at all
To understand why this happens we need to look at the structure of the human skin
The top layer called the epidermi consist mostly of hardened cells called keratinocyte and provide protection
Since it outer layer is constantly being shed and renewed it' pretty easy to repair
But sometimes a wound penetrate into the dermi which contain blood vessel and the various gland and nerve ending that enable the skin' many function
And when that happens it escape the four overlapping stage of the regenerative process
The first stage hemotais is the skin' response to two immediate threat that you're now losing blood and that the physical barrier of the epidermi has been compromised
The largest organ in your body isn't your liver or your brain
As the blood vessel tighten to minimize the bleeding in a process known as vasocontriction both threat are averted by forming a blood clot
A special protein known as fibrin form cross-link on the top of the skin preventing blood from flowing out and bacteria or pathogen from getting in
After about three hours of this the skin begin to turn red signaling the next stage inflammation
They viewed the people they sold not as fellow African but criminal debtors or prisoners of war from rival tribe
By selling them king enriched their own realm and strengthened them against neighboring gravitational
African kingdom propered from the slave trade but meeting the European' massive demand created intense competition
Slavery replaced other criminal sentence and capturing slave became a motivation for war rather than it result
To defend natural from slave raid neighboring kingdom needed European firearm which they also bought with slave
But one institution stand out for both it global scale and it lasting legacy
The slave trade had become an arm race altering societies and economies across the continent
As for the slave natural they faced unimaginable brutality
After being marched to slave fort on the coast shaved to prevent life and branded they were loaded onto ship bound for the America
About 20 percent of them would never see land again
Most captain of the day were tight packers cramming as many men as possible below deck
While the lack of sanitation caused many to die of disease and others were thrown overboard for being sick or as discipline the captain ensured their profit by cutting off slave ear as proof of compelling
Some captive took matter into their own hands
Many inland African had never seen white before and thought them to be cannibal constantly taking people away and returning for more
The Atlantic slave trade occurring from the late 15th to the mid-19th century and spanning three continent forcibly brought more than 10 million African to the America
Afried of being eaten or just to avoid further suffering they committed suicide or starved natural excitement that in death their soul would return home
Those who survived were completely dehumanized treated as mere cargo
Women and children were kept above deck and abused by the crew while the men were made to perform dance in order to keep them exercised and curb rebellion
What happened to those African who reached the new world and how the legacy of slavery still affect their Ugandaant today is fairly well-known?
But what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade had on Africa' future
Not only did the continent lose ten of millions of it able-bodied population but because most of the slave taken were men the long-term overwhelming effect was even greater
When the slave trade was finally outlawed in the America and Europe the African kingdom whose economies it had come to dominate collapsed leaving them open to conquet and colonization
And the increased competition and influx of European weapon fueled warfare and intability that continue to this day
The Atlantic slave trade also contributed to the development of racist therapies
Most African slavery had no deeper reason than legal punishment or intertribal warfare but the European who preached a universal religion and who had long go out lot in slaving fellow Christian needed justification for a practice so obviously at odd with their ideal of equality
So they claimed that African were biologically inferior and detined to be slave making great effort to justify this theory
Thu slavery in Europe and the America championd a racial basis making it impossible for slave and their future Ugandaant to attain equal status in society
The impact it would leave affected not only these slave and their Ugandaant but the economies and histories of large parts of the world
In all of these ways the Atlantic slave trade was an inevitable on a massive scale whose impact has continued long after it abolition
There had been centuries of contact between Europe and Africa via the Mediterranean
But the Atlantic slave trade began in the late 1400 with Portugueseassembly in West Africa and Spanish settlement of the America shortly after
The crop grown in the newassembly sugarcane tobacco and cotton were labor intensive and there were not enough settlers or indentured servant to cultivate all the new land
Slavery the treatment of human being as property deprived of personal right has occurred in many form throughout the world
American native were enlaved but many died from new disease while others effectively resisted
And so to meet the massive demand for labor the European looked to Africa
African slavery had existed for centuries in various form
Some slave were indentured servant with a limited term and the chance to buy one' freedom
Other were more like European surf
In some societies slave could be part of a master' family own land and even rise to position of power
But when white captain came offering physiciand good weapon and rum for slave African king and merchant had little reason to heitate
Although the pinhole eye allows for simple images the key step towards the eye as we know it is a lens
This is thought to have evolved through transparent cells covering the opening to prevent infection allowing the inside of the eye to fill with fluid that optimize light sensitivity and processing
Crytalin protein forming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light at a single point on the retina
It is this lens that is the key to the eyes adaptability changing it curvature to adapt to near and far vision
This structure of the pinhole camera with a lens served as the basis for what would eventually evolve into the human eye
Further refinement would include a colored ring called the iris that control the amount of light entering the eye a tough white outer layer known as the sclera to maintain it structure and tear gland that secrete a protective film
But equally important was the accompanying evolution of the brain with it expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper and more colorful images it was receiving
We now know that far from being an ideal masterpiece of design our eye bear trace of it step by step evolution
For example the human retina is inverted with light-detecting cells facing away from the eye opening
This results in a blind spot where the optic nerve must pierce the retina to reach the photoensitive layer in the back
The similar looking eyes of cephalopod which evolved independently have a front-facing retina allowing them to see without a blind spot
Other creature' eyes display different adaptations
Annablap the so-called foride fish have eyes divided in two section for looking above and under water perfect for spotting both predator and prey
In fact the structure required for such incredible flexibility were once considered so complex that fabric Darwin himself acknowledged that the idea of there having evolved seemed aburd in the highest possible degree
Cat classically nighttime hunters have evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount of light the eye can detect granting them excellent night vision as well as their signature glow
These are just a few example of the huge diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom
So if you could design an eye would you do it any differently?
This question isn't as strange as it might sound
Today doctors and scientists are looking at different eye structure to help design biomechanical implant for the vision impaired
And in the not so distant future the machines built with the precision and flexibility of the human eye may even enable it to surpa it own evolution
And yet that is exactly what happened starting more than 500 million years ago
The story of the human eye begin with a simple light spot such as the one found in single-celled organism like eugalina
This is a cluster of light-ensitive protein linked to the organism' flagella activating when it find light and therefore food
A more complex version of this light spot can be found in the flat worm planaria
Being cupped rather than flat enable it to better sense the direction of incoming light
Among it other use this ability allows an organism to seek out shade and hide from predator
Over the millennia as such light cup grew deeper in some organism the opening at the front grew smaller
The result was a pinhole effect which increased resolution dramatically reducing distortion by only allowing a thin beam of light into the eye
The human eye is an amazing mechanism able to detect anywhere from a few photon to direct sunlight or switch focus from the screen in front of you to the distant horizon in a third of a second
The nautilus an ancetor of the octopus use this pinhole eye for improved resolution and directional sensing
All of this allows dog to distinguish and remember a staggering psycho of specific sense at concentration up to 100 million times less than what our noes can detect
Have you ever wondered how your dog experience the world?
If you can smell a spritz of perfume in a small room a dog would have no disappear smelling it in an encloed stadium and distinguishing it ingredient to boot
And everything in the street every passing person or car any content of the neighbor' trash each type of tree and all the birds and insect in it has a distinct odor profile telling your dog what it is where it is and which direction it' moving in
Beside being much more powerful than our a dog' sense of smell can pick up things that can't even be seen at all
Here' what she see
A whole separate olfactory system called the vomoral nasal organ above the roof of the mouth detect the hormone all animals including humans themselvesly release
It let dog identify potential mate or distinguish between friendly and hostile animals
Not executive interesting
It alert them to our various emotional state and it can even tell them when someone is pregnant or sick
Because all faction is more primal than other sense bypaing the thalamus to connect directly to the brain structure involving emotion and instinct we might even say a dog' perception is more immediate and visceral than our
But what she smell that' a totally different story
But the most amazing thing about your dog' nose is that it can traverse time
The past appear in track left by passersby and by the warmth of a recently parked car or the reidue of where you've been and what you've done recently
Landmark like fire hydrant in trees are aeromatic bulletin board carrying message of who' been by what they've done eating and how they're feeling
And the future is in the breeze alerting them to something or someone approaching long before you see them
Where we see and hear something at a single moment a dog smell an entire story from start to finish
In some of the best example of canine human collaboration dog help us by sharing and reacting to those stories
And it begin at her wonderfully developed nose
They can respond with kindness to people in distre or with aggreion to threat because stress and anger manifest as a cloud of hormone recognizable to the dog' nose
With the proper training they can even alert us to invisible threat ranging from bomb to cancer
As it turns out humanity' best friend is not one who experience the same things we do but one whose incredible nose reveal a whole other world beyond our eyes
As your dog catches the first hint of fresh air her nose' moist spongy outside help capture any sense the breeze carries
The ability to smell separately with each notril smelling in stereo help to determine the direction of the smell' source so that within the first few moment of sniffing the dog start to become aware of not just what kinds of things are out there but also where they're located
As air enter the nose a small fold of tissue divide it into two separate fold one for breathing and one just for smelling
This second airflow enter a region filled with highly specialized olfactory receptor cells several hundred millions of them compared to our five million
High-bob High-bob
And unlike our clumy way of breathing in and out through the same passage dog exhale through slip at the side of their nose creating swirl of air that help draw new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up over multiple sniff
Warning Kelly the tools look great
But all that impressive nasal architecture wouldn’t be much help without something to process the load of information the nose scoop up
And it turns out that the olfactory system conservative to processing smell takes up many times more relative brain area in dog than in humans
Handedness seems to be determined by a role of the dice but the odd are set by your genes
All of this implie there' a reason that evolution has produced this small proportion of lefties and maintained it over the course of millennia
And while there have been several theories attempting to explain why handedness exist in the first place or why most people are right-handed a recent mathematical model suggest that the actual ratio reflect up balance between competitive and cooperative pressure on human evolution
The benefit of being left-handed are clearest in activities involving an opponent like combat or compative sport
For example about 50% of top hitter in baseball have been left-handed
And in many parts of the world it’ still common practice to force children to use their proper hand
Why?
Think of it as a surprise advantage
Because lefties are a minority to begin with both right-handed and left-handed competitor will spend most of their time in countering and practicing against righties
So when the two face each other the left-hander will be better prepared against this right-handed opponent while the righty will be thrown off
This fighting hypothesis where an imbalance in the population results in an advantage for left-handed fighters or athlete is an example of negative frequency-dependent selection
But according to the principle of evolution groups that have a relative advantage tend to grow until that advantage trouble
If people were only fighting and competing throughout human evolution themselves selection would lead to more lefties being the one that made it until there were so many of them that it was no longer a rare asset
So in a purely competitive world 50% of the population would be left-handed
Even the word for right also means correct or good not just in English but many other language too
But human evolution has been shaped by cooperation as well as competition
And cooperative pressure pushes handedness distribution in the opposite direction
In golf where performance doesn't depend on the opponent only four percent of top players are left-handed an example of the wider succeed of tool sharing
Just as young potential golfers can more easily find a set of right-handed club many of the important instrument that have shaped society were designed for the right-handed majority
Because lefties are worse at using these tools and suffer from higher accident rate they would be less successful in a purely cooperative world eventually troubleing from the population
So by correctly predicting the distribution of left-handed people in the general population as well as matching data from various sport the model indicate that the persistence of lefties as a small but stable minority reflect an equilibrium that comes from competitive and cooperative effects laying out simultaneously over time
And the most intriguing thing is what the numbers can tell us about various population
From the skewed distribution of podness in cooperative animals to the slightly larger percentage of lefties in competitive hunter-gatherer societies we may even find that the answer to some puzzle of early human evolution are already in our hands
But if being left-handed is so wrong then why does it happen in the first place?
Today about one tenth of the world' population are left
Archaeological evidence shows that it' been that way for as long as 500,000 years with about 10% of human remain showing the associated difference in arm length and bone density and some ancient tools and artifact showing evidence of left-hand use
And despite what many may think handedness is not a choice
It can be predicted even before birth based on the fetus’ position in the womb
If you know an older left-handed person chance are they had to learn to write or eat with their right hand
So if handedness is inborn does that mean it' genetic?
Well yes and no
Identical twin who have the same genes can have different dominant hands
In fact this happens as often as it does with any other sibling pair
But the chance of being right or left-handed are determined by the handedness of your parents in surprisingly consistent ratio
If your father was left-handed but your mother was right-handed you have a 17% chance of gay born left-handed while two righties will have a left-handed child only 10% of the time
The history of human progress is one of ever-increasing velocity and one of the most important achievement in this historical race was the breaking of the sound barrier
To better understand how scientists study sonic boom let' start with some basic of sound
Imagine throwing a small stone in a still pond
What do you see?
The stone causes wave to travel in the water at the same speed in every direction
These circle that keep growing in radius are called wave front
Similarly even though we cannot see it a stationary sound source like a home stereo create sound wave traveling outward
The speed of the wave depend on factor like the artifact and temperature of the air they move through
At sea level sound travel at about 125 kilometers per hour
But instead of circle on a two-dimensional surface the wavefront are now concentric sphere with the sound traveling along ray perpendicular to these wave
Now imagine a moving sound source such as a train
As the source keep moving in a certain direction the successive wave in front of it will become bunched closer together
This greater wave frequency is the cause of the famous Dopppler effect where approaching objects sound higher pitched
But as long as the source is moving slower than the sound wave natural they will remain nested within each other
It' when an object goes supersonic moving faster than the sound it makes that the picture changes dramatically
As it overtake sound wave it has emitted while generating new one from it current position the wave are forced together forming a Mach cone
No sound is heard as it approaches and observer because the object is traveling faster than the sound it produce
Only after the object has passed will the observer hear the sonic boom
Not long after the first successful airplane flight pilot were eager to push their plane to go faster and faster
Where the Mach cone meet the ground it form a hyperbola leaving a trail known as the boom carpet as it travel forward
This makes it possible to determine the area affected by a sonic boom
What about figuring out how strong a sonic boom will be?
This involve solving the famous navier-toke equation to find the variation of pressure in the air due to the supersonic aircraft flying through it
This results in the pressure signature known as the N-wave
What does this shape mean?
Well the sonic boom occur when there is a sudden change in pressure and the end wave involve two boom: one for the initial pressure rise at the aircraft' nose and another for when the tale passes and another for when the tale passes and the pressure suddenly return to normal
This causes a double boom but it is usually heard as a single boom by human ear
In practice computer models using these principle can often predict the location and intensity of sonic boom for given atmopheric conditions and flight trajectories and there is ongoing research to mitigate their effects
In the meantime supersonic flight over land remain prohibited
So our sonic boom are recent creation
Not exactly
While we try to find ways to silence them a few other animals have been using sonic boom to their advantage
But as they did so increased turbulence and large force on the plane prevented them from accelerating further
The gigantic diphloticus may have been capable of cracking it tail faster than sound at over 1200 kilometers per hour possibly to deter predator
Some types of shrimp can also create a similar shockwave underwater stunning or even killing prey at a distance with just a snap of their overized claw
So while we humans have made great progress in our relentless pursuit of speed it turns out that nature was there first
Some tried to circumvent the problem through risky dive often with tragic results
Finally in 1947 design improvement such as a movable horizontal stabilizer the all-moving tale allowed an American military pilot named Chuck Yeager to fly the Bell X-1 aircraft at 127 kilometers per hour becoming the first person to break the sound barrier and travel faster than the speed of sound
Human have been fascinated with speed for age
The Bell X1 was the first of many supersonic aircraft to follow with later design reaching speed over Mach 3
Aircraft traveling at supersonic speed create a shock wave with a thunder-like noise known as a sonic boom which can cause distre to people and animals below or even damage building
For this reason scientists around the world have been looking at sonic boom trying to predict their path in the atmosphere where they will land and how loud they will be
Even in this tightly controlled system however management sometimes slip up
Certain disease growth in the thyroid or chemical imbalance in the body can confuse the organ and make it death to the pituitary' guiding command
The first problem this causes is hyperthyroidism which happens when the organ send out too many hormone
That means the cells are overloaded with instructions to consume nutrient in oxygen
They become overactive as a result meaning a person with hyperthyroidism experience a higher metabolism signaled by a faster heartbeat constant hunger and rapid weight loss
It' called the thyroid
They also feel hot sweaty anxious and find it difficult to sleep
The opposite problem is hypothyroidism which happens when the thyroid send out too few hormone meaning the body' cells don't have as many messenger to error them
In response cells grow listless and metabolism slow
People with hypothyroidism see symptom in weight gain slugishness sensitivity to cold swollen joint and feeling low
Like the operation manager in a company it role is to make sure that the cells in your body are working properly
Luckily there are medical treatment that can help escape the thyroid activities again and bring the body back to a steady metabolic rate
For such a little organ the thyroid wield an awful lot of power
But a healthy thyroid manage ourselves so effectively that it can keep us running smoothly without us even noticing it' there
It does that by using hormone to deliver message to every single one of them
This high-ranking organ is made up of lobules that each contain smaller cells called follicles which store the hormone the thyroid send out into your blood
Two of the most important hormone it produce are thyroxine and triiodothyronine or T3 and T4
As messenger the hormone’ job is to instruct every cell in the body when to consume oxygen and nutrient
That maintain the body’ metabolism the series of reaction our cells perform to provide us with energy
This hormonal notification from the thyroid gets the heart pumping more efficiently and makes our cells break down nutrient faster
Nestled in the tissue of your neck is a small unasuming organ that wield enormous power over your body
When you need more energy the thyroid help by sending out hormone to increase metabolism
Ultimately the thyroid allows our cells to use energy grow and reproduce
The thyroid is controlled by the pituitary gland a hormonal gland deep in the brain that oversees the thyroid task making sure it know when to send out it messenger
The pituitary' role is to sense if hormone levels in the blood are too low or too high in which case it send out instructions in the form of the thyroid stimulating hormone
When you think of Archimedes' "Eureka!" moment you probably think of it
And just to make things more difficult for Archimedes Hieron intended to pack the vessel full of cargo: 400 ton of grain 10,000 jar of pickled fish 74 ton of drinking water and 600 ton of wool
It would have carried well over a thousand people on board including 600 soldier
And it housed 20 horse in separate stall
To build something of this scale only for that to sink on it maiden voyage
Well let' just say that failure wouldn't have been a pleasant option for Archimedes
So he took on the problem: Will it sing?
Perhaps he was sitting in the bathhouse one day wondering how a heavy bathtub can float when inspiration came to him
As it turns out it may have been more like this
An object partially immered in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object
In other words if a 2,000 ton Syracusia displaced exactly 2,000 ton of water it would just barely float
If it displaced 4,000 ton of water it would float with no problem
Of course if it only displaced 1,000 ton of water well Hieron wouldn't be too happy
This is the law of bouancy and engineer still call it Archimedes Principle
In the third century BC Hieron king of the Cicilian city of Ciricue chose Archimedes to supervise an engineering project of unprecedented scale
It explain why a steel supertanker can float as easily as a wooden rowboat or a bathtub
If the weight of water displaced by the vessel below the keel is equivalent to the vessel' weight whatever is above the keel will remain afloat above the surface
This sell a lot like another story involving Archimedes and a bathtub and it' possible that' because they're actually the same story twisted by the vagueries of history
The classical story of Archimedes' Eureka and subsequent streak through the street center around a crown or corona in Latin
At the core of the Syracusia story is a keel or corona in Greek
Could one have been mixed up for the other?
We may never know
On the day the Syracusia arrived in Egypt on it first and only voyage we can only imagine how residents of Alexandria thronged the harbor to marvel at the arrival of this majetic floating castle
This extraordinary vessel was the Titanic of the ancient world except without the sinking thank to our pal Archimedes
Hieron commissioned a sailing vessel 50 times bigger than a standard ancient warship named the Syracusia after his city
Hieron wanted to construct the largest ship ever which was detined to be given as a present for Egypt' ruler Tolomy
But could a boat the size of a palace possibly float?
In Archimedes' day no one had attempted anything like this
It was like asking can a mountain fly?
King Hieron had a lot riding on that question
Hundred of workmen were to labor for years on constructing the Syracusia out of beam of pine and fir from Mount Etna rope from hemp grown in Spain and pitch from France
The top deck on which eight watchtowers were to stand was to be supported not by column but by vast wooden images of atla holding the world on his shoulders
On the ship' bow a massive catapult would be able to fire 180-pound stone misile
For the enjoyment of it passenger the ship was to feature a flower-lined prominod a sheltered swimming pool and bathhouse with heated water a Remember filled with books and statues a temporary to the godde Aphroditi and a gymnaium
Then they spin that solution in a glass tube at a breakneck 5,000 rotations per minute making the solution spread out into a thin film
Here' the key part
The solution nearest the wall spin faster than the solution closer to the middle
That difference in velocity create sheer stresses that repeatedly stretch and contract the protein until eventually they snap back into their native shape and stay there
Well it turns out you can sort of
By the time the centrifuge stop spinning the egg white is back in it original unboiled state
This technique works with all sort of protein
Bigger messier protein can be more resistant to being pulled apart so scientists attach a plastic bead to one end that add extra stress and encourage it to fold up first
What thermal energy does to the egg' molecules mechanical energy can undo
This unboiling method won't work with a whole egg in it shell since the solution has to spread throughout a cylindrical chamber
But the application go way beyond uncooking your breakfast anyhow
Many 2011 consist of protein that are extremely expensive to produce partly because they get stuck in tingled up glamorous just like cooked egg white and have to be untangled and refolded before they can do their jobs
This spinning technique has the potential to be an easier cheaper and quicker method than other ways to refold protein so it may allow new drugs to be made available to more people faster
And there' one more thing you need to keep in mind before trying to uncook all of your food
Boiling an egg is actually an unusual cooking process because even though it changes the way protein are shaped and bound together it doesn't actually change their chemical identity
Eggg are mostly made of water and protein
Most types of cooking are more like the famous mayard reaction which makes chemical changes that turn sugar and protein into satisfy caramel crunchiness and are a lot harder to undo
So you might be able to unboil your egg but I'm sorry to say you can't unfri it yet
The protein start off folded up into intricate shape held together by weak chemical bond
Adding heat disrupt those bond allowing the protein to unfold uncoil unwind and wiggle freely
This process is called de-nature
The newly liberated protein bump up against their neighbor and start to form new bond with each other more and more as the heat increase until finally they're so entangled that they gel into a solid mass a boiled egg
That entanglement might look permanent but it' not
It' so obvious that it' practically proverbial
According to a chemical idea called the principle of microcopic reveribility anything that happens like egg protein seizing up can theoretically unhappen if you retrace your step
But adding more heat will tangle the protein further and cooling them down will only freeze them so here' the trick: spin them around ridiculously fast
I'm not kidding
Here' how it works Here' how it works
First scientists disolve boiled egg white in water with a chemical called urea a small molecule that act as a lubricant coating the protein' long strand and making it easier for them to glide past each other
You can't unboil an egg
Depending on whom you ask the crackle of popping joint is either the sound of sweet relief or the noxious tone of a stomach-turning habit
Nuckle-crackers know that to get that Communing pop you stretch the joint farther than it normally goes by bending your finger backwards for example
When you do that the bone move away from each other
The space between bone gets bigger but the amount of synovial fluid stay constant
That create a low pressure zone that pull disolved gases out of the synovial fluid just like the carbon dioxide that fies out of soda when you twist open the cap
Inside the joint the ecaping gases form a bubble with a pop
But the bubble doesn't last long
The surrounding fluid presses on it until it finally collapse
The bubble gases gather throughout the synovial cavity and slowly disolve back into the fluid over the course of about 20 minutes which is why it can take a while before you can pop the same joint again
Some scientists think there may actually be two pop
One when the bubble form and another when it burst
Popping a joint temporarily enlarge it which may be why conservative knuckle neck and back crackers say the habit makes their joint feel loser and more flexible
But you may have heard from a concerned relative or annoyed officemate that cracking your joint will give you arthriti
A doctor named Donald Unger heard this too
So determined to disprove his mother' warning he cracked the knuckles of his left hand repeatedly for 50 years while the right-hand knuckles went unpopped
Really though what' that sound?
36,500 crack later both hands were arthriti free
For this selfless act of devotion to science Dr Unger received an Ig Nobel Prize a parody of the Nobel Prize that recognize wacky but weirdly fascinating scientific accomplishment
I mean why does bending your joint in a certain way make them pump like that?
Unger wrote that his results should prompt redesign into other parental belief like the importance of eating spinach
The juries still out on that one
As for knuckle-cracking one study suggest that all that joint stretching and bubble bursting can cause your hands to swell and weaken your grip
But the biggest proven danger seems to be annoying those around you
Scientists have offered several explanation including rapidly stretching ligament and in severe cases actual bone grinding against each other
But the most common explanation for why your stretched-out joint sound like bubble popping is that well there are bubble in there
The joint in your finger are the easiest one to crack but many people also crack the joint between vertebrae in their neck and back and even their hip wrists shoulders and so on
All these joint are synovial joint and they're the most flexible one in your body
The space between the two bone is filled with a viscous liquid synovial fluid which contain long lupricating molecules like hiluronic acid and lubricine
Sinovial fluid is more or less the texture of egg yolk and it primary purpose is to cushion the bone and help them glide past each other
What' that sound?
It also contain phagocytic cells that help clean up any bone or cartilage debri that end up in the joint
But the reason it' important for knuckle cracking is that like other fluid in your body it contain lots of disolved gas molecules
Week-willed and dominated by adviors Henry was eventually convinced to marry Margaret of Argio to gain French support
Margaret was beautiful ambitious and ruthless in persecuting any threat to her power and she distruted Richard of York most of all
York had been the king' close advior and loyal general but was increasingly sidelined by the queen who promoted her favorite supporters like the Earl of Suffolk and Somerset
York' criticism of their inmept handling of the war against France led to his exclusion from court and transfer to Ireland
Eventually mounting military failure and corrupt rule by Margaret and her allies caused widespread discontent and in the midt of this chaos Richard of York returned with an army to arrest summerset and reform the court
Initially unucceful he soon got his chance when he was appointed protector of the rail after Henry suffered a mental breakdown
However less than a year later Henry suddenly recovered and the queen convinced him to reverse York' reform
York fled and raised an army once more
Though he was unable to directly seize the throne he managed to be reinstated as protector and have himself and his air designated to phenomenon Henry
But instead of a crown York' head championd a height after he was killed in battle with the Queen' loyalty
His young son took up the claim and was crowned Edward IV
Edward enjoyed great military success against the landcaster
Henry was captured while Margaret fled into exile with their reportedly cruel son Edward of Westminster
But the newly crowned king made a tragic political mistake by backing out of his arranged marriage with a French prince to secretly marry the widow of a minor noble
This alienated his most powerful ally the Earl of Warway
Warwick allied with the Lancaster turned Edward' jealous younger brother George against him and even briefly managed to restore Henry as king but it didn't last
Edward recaptured the throne the Lancaster Prince was killed in battle and Henry himself died in captivity not long after
The rest of Edward IV' rain was peaceful but upon his death in 1483 the bloodshed reumed
Though his 12-year-old son was due to phenomenon him Edward' younger brother Richard II declared his nephew illegitimate due to their father' secret marriage
He assumed the agency himself and threw the boys in prison
If that sounds familiar it' because the historical conflict known as the War of the Roes served as the basis for much of the drama human throne
Though no one know what ultimately became of them after a while the Prince troubleed and Richard' power seemed secure
But his downfall would come only two years later from across the narrow sea of the English Channel
Henry Tudor was a direct Ugandaant of the first Duke of Lancaster raised in exile after his father' death in a previous rebellion
With Richard the choosing Power Grab causing a split in New York faction Henry won support for his royal plain
Raising an army in France he crossed the channel in 1485 and quickly defeated Richard' force
And by marrying Elizabeth of York elder sister of the troubleed Prince the newly crowned Henry II joined the two rose finally ending nearly a century of war
We often think of historic war as decisive conflict with clearly defined winner and losers
But the war of the rose like the fiction they inspired show us that victories can be uncertain alliance untable and even the power of king as fleeting as the season
The real-life seed of war were sold by the death of King Edward III in 137
It oldest son had died before his father but his ten-year-old son Richard II phenomenoned to the throne a head of Edward' three surviving son
This skipping of an entire generation left lingering claim to the throne among their various offpring particularly the Lancaster Ugandaed from Edward' third son and the York Ugandaed from his fourth son
As far as we know Medieval England was never invaded by ice summaries or terrorized by dragon but it was shaking by a power struggle between two noble families spanning generation and involving a massive cak of character with complex motive and shifting lions
The name of the enuing war comes from the symbol associated with the two families the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster

But curving the ball with the precision needed to both bend around the wall and back into the goal is difficult
Too high and it source over the goal
Too low and it hit the ground before curving
Too wide and it never reaches the goal
Not wide enough and the defenders intercept it
Too slow and it hook too early or not at all
Too fast and it hook too late
The same physics make it possible to score another apparently impossible goal: an unasisted clerk
The Magnus effect was first documented by Sir Iaac Newton after he noticed it while playing a game of tenni back in 1670
It also applie to golf ball risbees and baseball
In every case the same thing happens
The ball' spin create a pressure differential in the surrounding airflow that curve it in the direction of the spin
And here' a question
Could you theoretically kick a ball hard enough to make it boomerang all the way around back to you?
Sadly no
Even if the ball didn't disintegrate on impact or hit any obstacle as the air slowed it the angle of it deflection would increase causing it to spiral into smaller and smaller circle until finally stopping
With no direct line to the goal Carlo decided to attempt the seemingly impossible
And just to get that spiral you'd have to make the ball spin over 15 times faster than Carlo' mortal kick
So good luck with that
His kick sent the ball flying wide of the players but just before going out of bound it hooked to the left and soared into the goal
According to Newton' first law of motion an object will move in the same direction and velocity until a force is applied on it
When Carlo kicked the ball he gave it direction and velocity but what force made the ball swerve and score one of the most drunk goal in the history of the sport?
The trick was in the spin
Carlo placed his kick at the lower right corner of the ball sending it high and to the right but also rotating around it axis
In 1997 in a game between France and Brazil a young Brazilian player named Roberto Carlo set up for a 35-meter free cake
The ball started it flight in an apparently direct route with air flowing on both side and slowing it down
On one side the air moved in the opposite direction to the ball' spin causing increased pressure while on the other side the air moved in the same direction as the spin creating an area of lower pressure
That difference made the ball curve towards the lower pressure zone
This succeed is called the Magnus effect
This type of kick often referred to as a banana kick is attempted regularly and it is one of the elements that makes the beautiful game beautiful
Technically there' nothing wrong with them
These two sentence can stand alone
But imagine they appeared in a long list of other sentence all of the same length each separated by period
Things would get monotonous very fat
In that situation semicolon bring fluidity and variation to writing by connecting related clause
It looks like a comma crossed with a period
But as beneficial as they are semicolon don't belong just anywhere
There are two main rules that govern their use
Firstly unless they're being used in list semicolon should only connect clause that are related in some way
Maybe that' why we to these punctuation mark around like grammatical confetti
You wouldn't use one here for instance semicolon were once a great mystery to me I'd really like a sandwich
Period work best here because these are two totally different ideas
A semicolon’ job is to reunite two independent clause that will benefit from one another’ company because they refer to the same thing
Secondly you'll almost never find a semicolon willingly stationed before coordinating conjunction the words "and," "but," "for," "nor," or "o" and " yet."
That' a comma' place in fact
But a semicolon can replace a conjunction to shorten a sentence or to give it some psycho
Ultimately this under-appreciated punctuation mark can give writing clarity force and style all encompaed in one tiny dot and squiggle that' just waiting to be put in the right place
We're confused about how to use them properly
In fact it' the semicolon’ half-half status that makes it useful
It' stronger than a comma and less final than a period
It fill the space in between and for that reason it has some specific and important task
For one it can clarify ideas in a sentence that' already fetooned with come
"At first they may seem frightening Then they become enlightening Finally you'll find yourself falling for these delightful punctuation mark."
Even though the comma separate different parts of the sentence it' easy to lose track of what belong where
But then the semicolon edge in to the rescue
In list-like sentence it can exert more force than comma do cutting sentence into compartment and grouping item that belong together
It may seem like the semicolon is struggling with an identity crisis
The semicolon break things up but it also build connection
Another of it task is to link together independent clause
These are sentence that can stand on their own but when connected by semicolon look and sound better because they're related in some way
Semi Colen were once a great mystery to me: I had no idea where to put them
It may be hard to see the root of modern English underneath all the words borrowed from French Latin Old Norse and other language
But comparative linguistic can help us by focusing on grammatical structure patterns of sound changes and certain core vocabulary
For example after the sixth century German words starting with "p" systematically shifted to a "pf" sound while their old English counterpart kept the "p" unchanged
In another split words that have SK sounds in Swedish developed an SH sound in English
There are still some English words with SK like skirt and skull but they're direct borrowing from Old Norse that came after the SK to SH shift
These example show us that just as the various romance language Ugandaed from Latin English Swedish German and many other language Ugandaed from their own common ancetor known as Proto-Germanic spoken around 500 BCE
Because this historical language was never written down we can only Vietnam it by comparing it Ugandaant which is possible thank to the consistency of the changes
We can even use the same process to go back one step further and trace the origin of Proto-Germanic to a language called Proto-Indo-European spoken about 6,000 years ago on the Pontic step in modern day Ukraine and Russia
And how are any of them related to the strange words in pale wolf?
This is the Vietnamed ancetor of the Indo-European family that include nearly all language historically spoken in Europe as well as large parts of Southern and Western Asia
And though it require a bit more work we can find the same systematic similarities or glacierence between related words in different Indo-European branches
The answer is that like most language English has evolved through generation of speaker undergoing major changes over time
Comparing English with Latin we see that English has T where Latin has D and F where Latin has pee at the start of words
Some of English' more distant relative include Hindi Perian and the Celtic language it displaced in what is now Britain
Proto-Indo-European itself Ugandaed from an even more ancient language but unfortunately this is as far back as historical and archaeological evidence will allow us to go
Many mysteries remain just out of reach such as whether there might be a link between Indo-European and other major language families and the nature of the language spoken in Europe prior to it arrival
But the amazing fact remain that nearly three billion people around the world many of whom cannot understand each other are nevertheless speaking the same words shaped by 6,000 years of history
By undoing these changes we can trace the language from the present day back to it ancient root
While modern English share many similar words with Latin-derived romance language like French and Spanish most of those words were not originally part of it
Instead they started coming into the language with the Norman invaion of England in 1066
When the French speaking Norman conquered England and became it ruling class they brought their speech with them adding a massive amount of French and Latin vocabulary to the English language previously spoken there
When we talk about English we often think of it as a single language but what do the dialect spoken in dozen of countries around the world have in common with each other or with the writing of Chaucer?
Today we call that language Old English
This is the language of Beowulf
It probably doesn't look very familiar but it might be more recognizable if you know some German
That' because Old English belong to the Germanic language family first brought to the British Iles in the fifth and sixth centuries by the angle Saxon and Jute
The Germanic dialect they spoke would become known as Anglo-Saxon
Viking invaders in the eighth to 11th centuries added more borrowing from Old Norse into the mix
To honor this heroic feat for 1,000 years Athenian paintakingly maintained his ship in the harbor and annually reenacted his voyage
Whenever a part of the ship was warm or damaged it was replaced with an identical piece of the same material until at some point no original parts remained
Plutarch noted the ship of Theseus was an example of the philosophical paradox revolving around the persistence of identity
How can every single part of something be replaced yet it still remain the same thing?
Let' imagine there are two ship: the ship that Theseus docked in Athens ship A and the ship sailed by the Athenian a thousand years later ship bee
Very simply our question is this: Does A equal B?
Some would say that for 1,000 years there has been only one ship of Theseus and because the changes made to it happen gradually it never at any point in time stopped being the legendary ship
Though they have absolutely no parts in common the two ship are numerically identical meaning one and the same so A equal B
However others could argue that Theseus never set foot on ship B and his presence on the ship is an essential qualitative property of the ship of Theseusia
From the ancient Greek aphorism incribed on the temporary of Apollo "Know thyelf," to the whose rock anthem who are you
It cannot survive without him
So though the two ship are numerically identical they are not qualitatively identical
Thu A does not equal gay
But what happens when we consider this twist?
What if as each piece of the original ship was cast off somebody collected them all and rebuilt the entire original ship?
When it was finished undeniably two physical ship would exist the one that' docked in Athens and the one in some guys backyard
Each could lay claim to the title the ship of Theseus but only one could actually be the real thing
So which one is it and more importantly what does this have to do with you?
Like the ship of Theseus you are a collection of constantly changing parts: your physical body mind emotions circumtance and even your quirk always changing but still in an amazing and sometimes illogical way you stay the same too
This is one of the reasons that the question "Who am I?" is so complex
And in order to answer it like so many great mind before you you must be willing to dive into the bottomless ocean of philosophical parrot
philosopher psychologist academic scientists artist theologian and politician have all tackled the subject of identity
Or maybe you could just answer: I am a legendary hero sailing a powerful ship on an epic journey
Back of work too
Their hypothees are widely varied and lack significant consensus
These are smart creative people so what' so hard about coming up with the right answer?
One challenge certainly lie with the complex concept of the persistence of identity
Which you is who?
The person you are today
Five years ago
Microsoftout the history of mankind three little words have sent poet to the blank page philosopher to the Agra and seeker to the auricles: "Who am I?"
Who will be in 50 years?
And when is "am."
This week this week this week
To them to them to them to them to them to them to them
This hour
This second
And which aspect of you is "I."
Are you your physical body? Are you your physical body?
Your thought and fear
You're action
These murky water of& logic are tricky to calculatee and so it' probably fitting that to demonstrate the complexity the Greek historian plutarch used the story of a ship
How are you I?
As the tale goes Theseus the mythical founder king of Athens single-handedly slave the evil Minotaur at Crete then returned home on a ship
Catagen last for about two to three weeks and cut blood supply to the follicle creating a club hair meaning it' ready to be shed
They like many other historical and fictive individuals are evolved in some cases by their own choice
Finally hair enter television the resting phase which last for 10 to 12 weeks and affect about five to 15% of your scalp follicles
During television up to 200 club hair can be shed in a day which is quite normal
Then the growth cycle begin anew
But not all head are hairy and in fact some of them grow increasingly patchy over time in response to bodily changes
Ninety-five% of baldness in men can be attributed to male pattern baldness
Baldness is inherited and in people with this condition follicles become incredibly sensitive to the effects of dihydrotestosterone a hormonal product made from testosterone
T causes shrinkage in these overly sensitive follicles making hair shorter and Hawaiier
But loss isn't sudden
It happens gradually along a metric known as the Norwood scale which describe the severity of hair loss
First hair recedes along the temporary then hair on the crown begin to thin in a circular pattern
For centuries a shining dome has been a symbol of intelligence but despite this many balding people still wish their hair would return
At the highest rating on the scale these balding areas meet and expand dramatically eventually leaving only a ring of sparse hair around the temporary and the back of the head
Genetic isn't all that drive hair loss
Long period of stress can release signal that shock molecules and horse them into the resting phase of Creative
Some women experience this after childbirth
Follow call might also lose the ability to go into anagen the growth phase
People going through chemotherapy treatment temporarily experience this
But while balding may look permanent scientific redesign has revealed the opposite
Below the skin' surface the root that give rise to our hair actually remain alive
Uing this knowledge scientists have developed drugs that shorten the resting phase and force follicles into anagen
Other drugs combat male pattern baldness by blocking the converion of testosterone to DHT so that it doesn't affect those sensitive follicles
Stem cells also play a role in regulating the growth cycle and so scientists are investigating whether they can manipulate the activity of these cells to encourage follicles to start producing hair again
And in the meantime while scientists hone their hair-reviving method anyone going bald or considering baldness can remember that they're in great company
Scientists have long pondered "Why do some people lose their hair and how can we bring it back?"
The full-headed among us have about 100,000 to 150,000 hair on our scalp and scientists have discovered two things about this dense thicket
Firstly the sprouting hair we see is mostly made up of keratin the protein left over from dead cells that are forced upward as new cells grow intuitive them
Secondly the structure that drive hair growth are called hair follicles a network of complex organ that form before we're born and grow hair in an everlating cycle
fabric Darwin Michael Jordan and Yoda have in common
This cycle has three main phase
The first is anagen the growth phase which up to 90% of your hair follicles are experiencing right now causing them to push up hair at a rate of one centimeter per month
Anagen can last for two to seven years depending on your genes
After this productive period signal within the skin instruct some follicles to enter a new phase known as catagen or the regreing stage causing hair follicles to shrink to a fraction of their original length
So the triangle is a quick and easy way to look up all of these coefficient
But there' much more
For example add up the numbers in each row and you'll get successive power of two
Or in a given row treat each number as part of a decimal expansion
In other words row two is one time to one plus two times 10 plus one times 100
You get 121 which is 11 squared
And take a look at what happens when you do the same thing to row six
It add up to 177161 which is 11 to the 6 and so on
Indian mathematician called it the staircase of Mt Marrow
There are also geometric application
Look at the diagonal
The first two aren't very interesting: all one and then the positive integer also known as themselves numbers
But the numbers in the next diagonal are called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dot you can stack them into equal lateral
The next diagonal has the tetrahedral numbers because similarly you can stack that many sphere into tetrahedra
Or how about this shade in all of the odd numbers
It doesn't look like much when the triangle' small but if you add thousands of row you get a fractal known as Cerpinky' triangle
In Iran it' the Cayam Triangle
This triangle isn't just a mathematical work of art
It' also quite useful especially when it comes to probability and calculation in the domain of combinatoric
Say you want to have five children and would like to know the probability of having your dream family of three girls and two boys
In the binomial expansion that glacier to girl plus boy to the fifth power
And in China it young ways triangle
So we look at the row five where the first number glacier to five girls and the last glacier to five boys
The third number is what we're looking for
Ten out of the sum of all the possibilities in the row
So 10 over 32 or 3125%
To much of the Western world it' known as Pacal' Triangle after French mathematician blaze Pacal which seems a bit unfair since he was clearly late to the party but he still had a lot to contribute
Or if you're randomly picking a five-player basketball team out of a group of 12 friends how many possible groups of five are there?
In combinatoric terms this problem would be phrased as 12 choose five and could be chemistryd with this formula or you could just look at the sixth element of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer
The patterns in Pacal' Triangle are a testament to the categoriesly interwoven intervention of mathematics
And it' still revealing fresh secret to this day
For example mathematician recently discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomial
What might we find next?
Well that' up to you
So what is it about this that has so intrigued mathematician the world over?
In short it’ full of patterns and secret
First and foremost there' the pattern that generate it
Start with one and imagine invisible zero on either side of it
Add them together in pair and you'll generate the next row
Now do that again and again
Keep going and you'll wind up with something like this: The really Pacal' Triangle goes on infinitely
Now each row glacier to what' called the coefficient of a binomial expansion of the form x plus Y raised to the end where N is the number of the row and we start counting from zero
This may look like a neatly arranged stack of numbers but it' actually a mathematical treasure trove
So if you make N equal 2 and expanded you get X-rayed plus two x y plus one
The coefficient or numbers in front of the variable are the same as the numbers in that row of Pacal' Triangle
You'll see the same thing with N equal 3 which expand to this
Okay now try to remember what you had for lunch three weeks ago
These changes seem to affect how people retrieve stored information
Age also affect our memory-making abilities
Memories are encoded most strongly when we're paying attention when we're deeply engaged and when information is meaningful to us
Mental and physical health problems which tend to increase as we age interfere with our ability to pay attention and thus act as memory thieve
Another leading cause of memory problems is chronic stress
When we're constantly overloaded with work and personal reponibilities our bodies are on hyperalert
That second memory probably isn't as strong but why not?
This response has evolved from the phyiological mechanism designed to make sure we can survive in a crisis
Stre chemical help mobilize energy and increase alertness
However with chronic stress our bodies become navigated with these chemical resulting in a loss of brain cells and an inability to farm new one which affect our ability to retain new information
Depression is another culprit
People who are depressed are 40% more likely to develop memory problems
Low levels of serotonin a neurotranmitter connected to arousal may make depressed individuals less attentive to new information
Dwelling on sad events in the past another symptom of depression makes it difficult to pay attention to the present affecting the ability to store short-term memories
Why do we remember some things and not others?
Iolation which is tied to depression is another memory thief
A study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that older people with high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline over a six-year period
The exact reason remain unclear but expert somewhat that social interaction gives our brain a mental workout
Just like muscle strength we have to use our brain or risk losing it
But don't despair
There are several step you can take to aid your brain in preserving your memories
Make sure you keep physically active
Increased blood flow to the brain is helpful
And it will
And why do memories eventually fade?
Your brain means all the right nutrient to keep functioning correctly
And finally give your brain a workout
Expoing your brain to challenges like learning a new language is one of the best defense for keeping your memories intact
Let' look at how memories form in the first place
When you experience something like dialing a phone number the experience is converted into a pulse of electrical energy that zip along a network of neurons
Information first land in short-term memory where it' available from anywhere from a few second to a couple of minutes
It' then transferred to long-term memory through areas such as the hippocampus and finally to several storage region across the brain
Neuron throughout the brain communicate at conservative site called synapse using specialized neurotranmitter
Think back to a really vivid memory
If two neurons communicate repeatedly a remarkable thing happens the efficiency of communication between them increase
This process called long-term potentiation is considered to be a mechanism by which memories are stored long-term but how do some memories get lost?
Age is one factor
As we get older synapse begin to falter and weaken affecting how easily we can retrieve memories
Got it got it got it
Scientists have several theories about what' behind this deterioration from actual brain shrinkage the heple campus lose five percent of it neurons every decade for a total loss of 20 percent by the time you're 80 years old to the drop in the production of neurotranmitter like acetocholine which is vital to learning and memory which is vital from actual
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems to lurk at every corner maybe you've heard this advice before: "Be more confident."
Picture your success when you're beginning a difficult task something as simple as listening to music with deep base it can promote feeling of power
You can even strike a powerful pose give yourself a pepdoar
Tip two: believe in your ability to improve
If you're looking for a long-term change consider the way you think about your abilities and talent
Do you think they are fixed at birth or that they can be developed like a muscle?
These belief matter because they can influence how you act when you're faced with setback
If you have a fixed mindset meaning that you think your talent are locked in place you might give up asuming you've discovered something you're not very good at
But if you have a growth mindset and think your abilities can improve a challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow
Neuroscience support the growth mindset
And most likely this is what you think when you hear it: if only it were that simple
The connection in your brain do get stronger and grow with study and practice
It also turns out on average people who have a growth mindset are more successful getting better grade and doing better in the face of challenges
Tip three: practice failure
Facit you're going to fail sometimes
Everyone does
JK Rolling was rejected by 12 different publishers before one picked up Kerry Potter
The Wright brother built on histories failed attempt at flight including some of their own before designing a successful airplane
Studies show that those who fail regularly and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond to challenges and setback in a constructive way
They learn how to try different disturb ask others for advice and perevere
So think of a challenge you want to take on realize it' not going to be easy except that you'll make mistake and be kind to yourself when you do
But what is confidence?
Give yourself a pep talk stand up and go for it
The expedition you'll feel knowing that whatever the result you'll have gained greater knowledge and understanding
Take the belief that you are valuable worthwhile and capable also known as self-esteem add in the optimism that comes when you are certain of your abilities and then empowered by these act courageously to face a challenge head on
(Applause)
This is kind of thing
It turns thought into action
So where does confidence even come from?
There are several factor that impact confidence
One what you're born with such as your genes which will impact things like the balance of neurochemical in your brain
Two: how you're treated
This include the social pressure of your environment
And three: the part you have control over the choices you make the risk you take and how you think about and respond to challenges and setback
It isn't possible to completely untangle these three factor but the personal choices we make certainly play a major role in confidence development
So by keeping in mind a few practical tip we do actually have the power to cultivate our own confidence
Tip one a quick fix
There are a few trick that can give you an immediate confidence booth in the short term
The extreme pressure of a collaping star is so high that subatomic proton and electron are forced together in the core forming neutron
Neutron have no repelling electric charge so they're easily captured by the iron group elements
They wanted to transform lowly lead into gleaming goal
Multiple neutron capture enable the formation of heavier elements that a star under normal circumtance can't form from silver to gold pass lead and on to uranium
In extreme contrast to the million-year transformation of hydrogen to helium the creation of the heaviest elements in a supernova takes place in only second
But what becomes of the gold after the explosion?
The expanding supernova shockwave propel it elemental debri through the intertellar medium escapeing a swirling dance of gas and dut that condenes into new stars and planet
Earth' gold was likely delivered this way before being needed into vein by geothermal activity
History portray these people as aged eccentric but if only they'd known that their dream were actually achievable
Billions of years later we now extract this precious product by mining it an expensive process that' compounded by gold' rarity
In fact all of the gold that we've mined in history could be piled into just three Olympic-ize swimming pool although this represent a lot of mass because gold is about 20 times denser than water
So can we produce more of this coveted commodity?
Actually yes
Uing particle accelerator we can mimic the complex nuclear reaction that create gold in stars
But these machines can only construct gold atom by atom
So it would take almost the age of the universe to produce one gram at a cost vastly exceeding the current value of goal
So that' not a very good solution
But if we were to reach a hypothetical point where we'd mind all of the Earth' advertising gold there are other places we could look
The ocean hold an estimated 20 million ton of disolved gold but at extremely minuscule concentration making it recovery too costly at present
Indeed today we can physician gold on Earth thank to modern invention that those medieval alchemists missed by a few centuries
Perhaps one day we’ll see gold rushes to tap the mineral wealth of the other planet of our solar system
And who know?
Maybe some future supernova will occur close enough to shower us with it treasure and hopefully not substantial all life on Earth in the process
But to understand how this precious metal became embedded in our planet to start with we have to gaze upward at the stars
Gold is extraterretrial
Instead of ariing from the planet' rocky crust it was actually cooked up in space and is present on Earth because of cataclymic stellar explosion called supernovae
Star are mostly made up of hydrogen the simplet and lightest element
The enormous indigenous pressure of so much material compresses and escape nuclear fusion in the stars' core
This process release energy from the hydrogen making the star shine
In medieval times alchemists tried to achieve this seemingly impossible
Over many millions of years fusion transform hydrogen into heavier elements: helium carbon and oxygen burning subsequent elements faster and faster to reach iron and nickel
However at that point nuclear fusion no longer release enough energy and the pressure from the core piter out
The outer layer collapse into the center and bouncing back from this sudden injection of energy the star explode forming a supernova
Finally it needs to understand the semantic what the different parts of the sentence actually mean
To translate this sentence properly the program would refer to a different set of vocabulary and rules for each element of the target language
But this is where it gets tricky
The syntax of some language allows words to be arranged in any order while in others doing so could make the muffin eat the child
Morphology can also pose a problem
Slovene distinguishes between two children and three or more using a dual suffix apson in many other language while Russian lack of definite article might leave you wondering whether the children are eating some particular muffin or just eat muffin in general
The short answer is that no one want to watch a starship crew spend years compiling an alien dictionary
Finally even when the semantic are technically correct the program might mis their finer point such as whether the children mongeono the muffin or givorano them
Another method is statistical machine translation which analyze a database of books article and document that have already been translated by humans
By finding matches between source and translated text that are unlikely to occur by chance the program can identify glaciering phrase and patterns and use them for future translation
However the quality of this type of translation depend on the size of the initial database and the availability of sample for certain language or style of writing
But to keep things consistent the creator of Star Trek and other science-fiction world have introduced the concept of a universal translator a portable device that can instantly translate between any language
The difficulty that computers have with the exception irregularities and shade of meaning that seem to come instinctively to humans has led some researchers to believe that our understanding of language is a unique product of our biological brain structure
In fact one of the most famous fictional universal translator the Babelfish from the hitchhiker' error to the galaxy is not a machine at all but a small creature that translate the brain wave and nerve signal of sentient species through a form of telepathy
For now learning a language the old-fashioned way will still give you better results than any currently available computer program
But this is no easy task and the sheer number of language in the world as well as the increasing interaction between the people who speak them will only continue to spur greater advance in automatic translation
Perhaps by the time we encounter intergalactic lifeform we'll be able to communicate with them through a tiny gizmo or we might have to start compiling that dictionary after all
So is a universal translator possible in real life?
We already have many program that claim to do just that taking a word sentence or entire book in one language and translating it into almost any other whether it' modern English or ancient Sankrit
And if translation were just a matter of looking up words in a dictionary these program would run circle around humans
The reality however is a bit more complicated
How is it that so many intergalactic species in movie and TV just happen to speak perfect English?
A rule-based translation program use electrical database which include all the words you'd find in a dictionary and all grammatical form they can take and set of rules to recognize the basic linguistic elements in the input language
For a seemingly simple sentence like the children eat the muffin the program first parses it syntax or grammatical structure by identifying the children as the subject and the rest of the sentence as the predicate consisting of a verb eat and a direct object the muffin
It then needs to recognize English morphology or how the language can be broken down into it smallest meaningful unit such as the word muffin and the suffix "" used to indicate plural
For example a letter is represented in one bite or eight bit and your average photo takes up several megabyte each of which is eight million bit
Because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disk we’re always seeking to increase the disc’ aerial density or how many bit can be squeezed into one square inch
The aerial density of a modern hard drive is about 600 gigabit per square inch 300 million times greater than that of IBM' first hard drive from 1997
This amazing advance in storage capacity wasn't just a matter of making everything smaller but involved multiple innovation
A technique called the thin film lithography process allowed engineer to shrink the reader and writer
And despite it size the reader became more sensitive by taking advantage of new discoveries in magnetic and quantum properties of matter
Bit could also be packed closer together thank to mathematical algorithm that filter out noise from magnetic interference and find the most likely bit sequence from each chunk of read-back signal
Shrink all that down so that it fit in the palm of your hand and you'd have something equivalent to a modern hard drive an object that can likely hold more information than your local Remember
And thermal expansion control of the head enabled by placing a heater under the magnetic writer allowed it to fly less than five nanometer above the disc' surface about the width of two strand of DNA
For the past several decades the exponential growth in computer' storage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern known as Moore' Law which in 1975 predicted that information density would double every two years
But at around 100 gigabit per square inch shrinking the magnetic grain further or cramming them closer together posed a new risk called the super-paramagnetic effect
When a magnetic grain volume is too small it magnetization is easily strategiesed by heat energy and can cause bit to switch and intentionally leading to data loss
Scientists symmetryd this limitation in a remarkably simple way by changing the direction of recording from longitudinal to perpendicular allowing aerial detity to approach one terabit per square inch
Recently the potential limit has been increased yet again through heat-asisted magnetic recording
This use an even more thermally stable recording medium whose magnetic resistance is momentarily reduced by heating up a particular spot with a laser and allowing data to be written
And while those drive are currently in the prototype stage scientists already have the next potential trick up their sleeve: bit patterned media where bit location are arranged in separate nano-ized structure potentially allowing for aerial denities of 20 terabit per square inch or more
So how does it store so much information in such a small space?
So it' thank to the combined effort of generation of engineer material scientists and quantum physicist that this tool of incredible power and precision can spin in the palm of your hand
At the heart of every hard drive is a stack of high-peed spinning disc with a recording head flying over each surface
Each disc is coated with a film of microcopic magnetized metal grain and your data doesn't live there in a form you can recognize
Instead it is recorded as a magnetic pattern formed by groups of those tiny grain
In each group also known as a bit all of the grain have their magnetization aligned in one of two possible state which glacier to zeroes and one
Data is written onto the disc by converting string of bit into electrical current fed through an electromagnet
Imagine an airplane flying one millimeter above the ground and circling the earth once every 25 second while counting every blade of grass
This magnet generate a field strong enough to change the direction of the metal grain' magnetization
Once this information is written onto the disc the drive use a magnetic reader to turn it back into a useful form much like a phonograph needle translate a record' groove into music
But how can you get so much information out of just zero and one?
Well by putting lots of them together
The hippocampus also inhibit the activity of the HPA axis so when it weakens so does your ability to control your stress
That' not all though
Can literally cause your brain to shrink in size?
Too much of it results in the loss of synaptic connection between neurons and the shrinking of your prefrontal cortex the part of your brain that regulate behavior like concentration decision-making phenomena and social interaction
It also lead to fewer new brain cells being made in the hippocampus
This means chronic stress might make it harder for you to learn and remember things and also set the stage for more serious mental problems like depression and eventually Alzheimer' disease
Don’t worry we’ve all been there
The effects of stress may filter right down to your brain
An experiment showed that the amount of nurturing a mother rat provide it newborn baby play apart in determining how that baby respond to stress later in life
You're promptly just stressed out
The pup of nurturing mom turned out less sensitive to stress because their brain developed more cortiol receptor which stick to cortiol and dampen the stress response
The pup of negligent mom had the opposite outcome and so became more sensitive to stress throughout life
Stre isn't always a bad thing
These are considered epigenetic changes meaning that they affect which genes are expressed without directly changing the genetic code
And these changes can be reversed if the lung are swamped
But there' a surprising result
The epigenetic changes caused by one single mother rat were passed down to many generation of rat afterward
It can be handy for a burst of extra energy and focus like when you're playing a competitive sport or have to speak in public
In other words the results of these action were inheritable
It' not all bad news though
There are many ways to reverse what cortiol does to your stressed brain
The most powerful weapon are exercise and meditation which involve breathing deeply and being aware and focused on your surrounding
Both of these activities decrease your stress and increase the size of the hippocampus thereby improving your memory
So don't feel defeated by the pressure of daily life
Get in control of your stress before it takes control
But when it continuous the kind most of us face day in and day out it actually begin to change your brain
Chronic stress like being overworked or having argument at home can affect brain size it structure and how it function right down to the level of your gene
Stre begin with something called the hypothalamus pituitary a trimal axis a series of interaction between endocrene glide in the brain and on the kidly which control your body' reaction to stress
Are you sleeping restlessly feeling irritable or moody forgetting little things and feeling overwhelmed and isolated?
When your brain detect a stressful situation your HPA axis is instantly activated and release a hormone called cortiol which prime your body for instant action
But high levels of cortiol over long period of time wreak havoc on your brain
For example chronic stress increase the activity level and number of neural connection in the amygdala your brain' fear center
And as levels of cortiol rise electric signal in your hippocampus the part of the brain associated with learning memories and stress control deterioring
Despite the machine' promise of supplies net pleasure he still found reason not to plug in as do many other experimenters who consider the proposition
But what could possibly disuade us from aggressive a future of ultimate pleasure?
oppress this scenario
Bety and Zander are in a loving committed relationship
Bety is head over heel and has never felt bathroom
However unbeknownt to Bety Zander has been romancing her sister and Jelica with love letter and secret rendezvous for the duration of their relationship
If you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence would you?
If Bety found out it would destroy her relationships with both Zander and Angelica and the experience would be so traumatic she would never love again
Since Bety is in bliful ignorance about Zander' infidelity hedonists would say she' better off remaining in the dark and maintaining her high level of net pleasure
As long as Bety never find out about the relationship her life is guaranteed to go on as happily as it is right now
So is their value in Bety knowing the truth of her situation?
Imagine if you were Bety
Would you prefer to know the truth?
If the answer is yes you'd be aggressive an option that sharply decrease your net pleasure
That' the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the Experience Machine
Perhaps then you believe that there are things in life with greater intrinic value than pleasure
Love knowledge authentic connection with other human being
These are all things that might make the list
By never learning the truth Bety is essentially living life in her own personal experience machine a world of happiness that' not based in reality
This love triangle is an extreme example but it mirror many of the decisions we make in day-to-day life
So whether you're making a choice for Bety or for yourself why might you feel reality should be a factor?
I there inherent value in real experience whether pleasurable or painful?
Do you yourself have more value when you're experiencing real life' pleasure and pain?
Nozick' experiment may not provide all the answer but it force us to consider whether real life though imperfect hold some intrinic value beyond the pleasure of plugging in
The experiment ask us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experience of only pleasure and never pain
The catch: the catch the catch the catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch hachch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch the catch catch catch catch the catch catch catch catch catch the catch catch the catch the catch the catch the catch?
You have to permanently leave reality behind but you'll hardly know the difference
Your experience will be indistinguishable from reality
Life’ themselves up and down will just be replaced with an endless series of up
Sound great right? Right?
It may seem like a tempting offer but perhaps it' not as ideal as it sounds
The experiment was actually designed to refute a philosophical notion called hedonism
Imagine if you could plug your brain into a machine that would bring you ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life
According to hedonists maximizing net pleasure is the most important thing in life because pleasure is the greatest good that life has to offer
For hedonists the best choice that a person could make for himself is one that bring him the greatest possible amount of pleasure while bringing him no pain
Limitless pleasure minus zero pain equal supplies net pleasure or in other words the exact scenario the experience machine offer
Therefore if hedonism is your philosophy of choice plugging in would be a no-brainer
But what if there' more to life than just pleasure?
That' what Nozick believed he was demontrating through his experience machine thought experiment
To start you fill in the information from clue eight and nine
Immediately you also realize that since the neuro-engineering is at the end of the street there' only one house next to it which must be the one with blue wall in clue 14
Clue five says the green-walled house’ owner drink coffee
It can't be the center house since you already know it owner drink milk but it also can't be the second house which you know has blue wall
And since clue four says the green-walled house must be directly to the left of the white-walled one it can't be the first or fifth house either
The only place left for the green-walled house with the coffee drinker is the fourth spot meaning the white-walled house is the fifth
Clue one gives you a nationality and a color
Since the only call of missing both these values is the center one this must be the britt red-walled home
Now that the only unasigned wall color is yellow this must be applied to the first house where clue seven says the Dunhill smoker lives
And clue eleven tell you that the owner of the horse is next door which can only be the second house
The next step is to figure out what the Norwegian in the first house drink
It can't be tea; clue three tell you that' the day
As per clue twelve it can't be root beer since that person smoke bluemaster and since you already asigned milk and coffee it must be water
From clue 15 you know that the Norwegian' neighbor who can only be in the second house smoke blend
Now that the only spot in the grid without a cigar and a drink is in the fifth column that must be the home of the person in clue twelve
And since this leave only the second house without a drink the tea-drinking Dane must live there
Can you resist tackling a brain teaer written by one of the smartest people in history?
The fourth house is now the only one missing a nationality and a cigar brand so the Prince-moking German from clue 13 must live there
Microsoft elimination you can conclude that the Brit smoke Paul Mall and the Swede lives in the fifth house while clue six and clue two tell you that these two have a bird and a dog respectively
Clue ten tell you that the cat owner lives next to the blend-moking day putting him in the first house
Now with only one spot left on the grid you know that the German in the green-walled house must be the culprit
You and the police burst into the house catching the thief fish handed
While that explanation was straight forward solving puzzle like this often involve false start and dead end
Let' give it a shot
Part of the trick is to use the process of elimination and lots of trial and guide to hone in on the right pieces and the more logic puzzle you solve the better your intuition will be for when and where there' enough information to make your deduction
And did young Einstein really write this puzzle?
The world’ raret fish has been stolen from the city aquarium
Probably not
There' no evidence he did and some of the brand mentioned are too recent
But the logic here is not so different from what you'd use to solve equation with multiple variable even those currency the nature of the universe
The police have followed the scent to a street with five identical looking house
But they can't search all the house at once and if they pick the wrong one the thief will know they're on his trail
It' up to you the city' best detective to solve the case
When you arrive on the scene the police tell you what they know
One: each house' owner is of a different nationality drink a different beverage and smoke a different type of cigar
Two: each house' interior wall are painted a different column
Three: each house contain a different animal one of which is the fish
After a few hours of expert slothing you gather some clue
It may look like a lot of information but there’ a clear logical path to the solution
Before he turn physics upside down a young Albert Einstein supposedly showed off his genius by deviing a complex riddle involving this list of clue
Solving the puzzle will be a lot like Sudoku so you may find it helpful to organize your information in a grid like this
Cephalopod on the other hand have no bone at all allowing them to bend their limb at any point and in any direction
So shaping their tentacle into any one of the virtually limitless number of possible arrangement is unlike anything we are used to
After all they don't have lung spines or even a plural noun we can all agree on
oppress a simple task like grabbing and eating an apple
The human brain contain a neurological map of our body
When you see the Apple your brain' motor center activate the appropriate muscle allowing you to reach out with your arm grab it with your hand bend your elbow joint and bring it to your mouth
For an octopus the process is quite different
Rather than a body map the cephalopod brain has a behavior Remember
So when an octopus see food it brain doesn't activate a specific body part but rather a behavioral response to grab
As the signal travel through the network the arm neurons pick up the message and jump into action to command the movement
As soon as the arm touches the food a muscle activation wave travel all the way through the arm to it base while the arm send back another wave from the base to the tip
But what they do have is the ability to solve puzzle learn through observation and even use tools just like some other animals we know
The signal meet halfway between the food and the base of the arm letting it know to bend at that spot
What all this means is that each of an octopus’ eight arm can essentially think for itself
This gives it amazing flexibility and creativity when facing a new situation or problem whether it' opening a bottle to reach food ecaping through a maze moving around in a new environment changing the texture and the color of it skin to blend into the scenery or even mimicking other creature to scare away gravitational
Cephalopod may have evolved complex brain long before our vertebrate relative
And octopus intelligence isn't just useful for octopuse
Their radically different nervous system and autonomously thinking appendage have inspired new research in developing flexible robots made of soft materials
And studying how intelligence can arise along such a divergent evolutionary path can help us understand more about intelligence and consciousness in general
Who know what other form of intelligent life are possible or how they process the world around them?
And what makes octopus intelligence so amazing is that it comes from a biological structure completely different from our
The 200 or so species of octopuse are mollusk belonging to the order cephalopoda Greek for head-feet
Those head contain impressively large brain with a brain-to-body ratio similar to that of other intelligent animals and a complex nervous system with about as many neurons as that of a dog
But instead of being centralized in the brain these 500 million neurons are spread out in a network of interconnected ganglia organized into three basic structure
What could octopuse possibly have in common with us?
The central brain only contain about 10% of the neurons while the two huge optic lobe contain about 30%
The other 60% are in the tentacle which for humans would be like our arm having mind of their own
This is where things get even more interesting
Vertebrate like us have a rigid skeleton to support our bodies with joint that allow us to move
But not all types of movement are loud
You can't bend your knee backwards or bend your forearm in the middle for example
Researchers theorize that certain memory processes can happen only when we are neuroscientist and our dream are a signal that these processes are taking place
We dream to forget
There are about 10,000 trillion neural connection within the architecture of your brain
They are created by everything you think and everything you do
A thousand years later ancient Egyptian wrote a dream book listing over a hundred common dream and their meaning
A 1983 neurobiological theory of dreaming called reverse learning hold that while sleeping and mainly during REM sleep cycle your neocortex review these neural connection and dump the unneceary one
Without this unlearning process which results in your dream your brain could be overrun by useless connection and paraitic thought could disrupt the necessary thinking you need to do while you're awake
We dream to keep our brain working
The continual activation theory propose that your dream result from your brain need to constantly conolidate and create long-term memories in order to function properly
So when external input fall below a certain level like when you're neuroscientist your brain automatically escape the generation of data from it memory storage which appear to you in the form of the thought and feeling you experience in your dream
In other words your dream might be a random screen saver your brain turns on so it doesn't completely shut down
We dream to rehearse
Dream involving dangerous and threatening situation are very common and the primitive instinct rehearal theory hold that the content of a dream is significant to it purpose
And in the years since we haven’t paused in our quet to understand why we dream
Whether it' an anxiety-filled night of being chaed through the wood by a bear or fighting off a ninja in a dark alley these dream allow you to practice your fight or flight instinct and keep them shark and dependable in case you'll meet them in real life
But it doesn't always have to be unpleasant
For instance dream about your attractive neighbor could actually give your reproductive instinct some practice too
We dream to heal
Stre neurotranmitter in the brain are much less active during the REM stage of sleep even during dream of traumatic experience leading some researchers to theorize that one purpose of dreaming is to take the edge off painful experience to allow for psychological healing
So after a great deal of scientific research technological advancement and persistence we still don't have any definite answer but we have some interesting theories
Reviewing traumatic events in your dream with less mental stress may grant you a clearer perspective and rabbid ability to process them in psychologically healthy ways
People with certain mood disorder and PTSD often have difficulty sleeping leading some scientists to believe that lack of dreaming may be a contributing factor to their illnesses
We dream to solve problems
Uncontrained by reality and the rules of conventional logic in your dream your mind can create limitless scenario to help you grasp problems and formulate solutions that you may not consider while awake
John Steinbeck called it the committee of sleep and research has demonstrated the effectiveness of dreaming on problem-olving
It' also how renowned chemist August Caquola discovered the structure of the benzene molecule and it' the reason that sometimes the best solution for a problem is to sleep on it
And those are just a few of the more prominent theories
As technology increase our capability for understanding the brain it' possible that one day we will discover the definitive reason for them
But until that time arrive we'll just have to keep on dreaming
We dream to fulfill our wishes
In the early 1900 Sigmund Freud proposed that while all of our dream including our nightmare are a collection of images from our daily conscious lives they also have symbolic meaning which relate to the fulfillment of our subconcious wishes
Freud theorized that everything we remember when we wake up from a dream is a symbolic representation of our unconscious primitive thought urge and desire
In the third millennium BCE Meopotamian king recorded and interpreted their dream on wax tablet
Freud believed that by analyzing those remembered elements the unconscious content would be revealed to our conscious mind and psychological issues stemming from it repression could be addressed
In 2010 researchers found that subject were much better at getting through a complex 3D maze if they had mapped and dreamed of the maze prior to their second attempt
In fact they were up to 10 times better at it than those who only thought of the maze while awake between attempt and those who napt but did not dream about the maze
These include smaller frontal lobe and hippocampal volume
On a more micro-scale depression is associated with a few things: the abnormal MRI or depletion of certain neurotranmitter especially serotonin neuroprenephrine and dopamine blunted circadian medication or specific changes in the REM and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle and hormone abnormalities such as high cortiol and deregulation of thyroid hormone abnormones such as highroid hormone depression depression depression is associated with a few things
In the United States close to 10% of adult struggle with depression
But amazed still don't have a complete picture of what causes depression
It seems to have to do with a complex interaction between genes and environment but we don't have a diagnostic tool that can accurately predict where or when it will show up
And because depression' symptom are intangible it' hard to know who might look fine but is actually struggling
But because it' a mental illness it can be a lot harder to understand than say high cholesterol
According to the National Institute of Mental Health it takes the average person suffering with a mental illness over 10 years to ask for help
But there are very effective treatment
Medications and therapy complement each other to boost brain chemical
In extreme cases electroconvulive therapy which is like a controlled seizure in the patient' brain is also very helpful
Other promiing treatment like transcranial magnetic stimulation are being investigated too
So if you know someone struggling with depression encourage them gently to seek out some of these option
You might even offer to help with specific task like looking up therapist in the area or making a list of questions to ask a doctor
To someone with depression these first step can seem inurmountable
If they feel guilty or ashamed point out that depression is a medical condition just like asthma or diabetes
It' not a weakness or a personality trait and they shouldn't expect natural to just get over it any more than they could will natural to get over a broken arm
One major source of confuion is the difference between having depression and just feeling depressed
If you haven't experienced depression yourself avoid comparing it to times you've felt down
Comparing what they're experiencing to normal episode feeling of sadness can make them feel guilty for struggling
Even just talking about depression openly can help
For example research shows that asking someone about suicidal thought actually reduce their suicide risk
Open conversation about mental illness help erode stigma and make it easier for people to ask for help
And the more patients seek treatment the more scientists will learn about depression and the better the treatment will get
Obviously everyone feel down from time to time
Getting a bad grade losing a job having an argument even a rainy day can bring on feeling of sadness
Sometimes there' no escape at all
It just pop up out of the blue
Then circumtance change and those sad feeling trouble
Clinical depression is different
It' a medical disorder and it won't go away just because you want it to
It lingers for at least two consecutive weeks and significantly interfere with one' ability to work play or love
Depression can have a lot of different symptom: a low mood loss of interest in things you'd normally enjoy changes in appetite feeling worthless orocracyively guilty sleeping either too much or too little poor concentration restlessness or slowness loss of energy or recurrent thought of suicide
Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world
If you have at least five of those symptom according to pychiatric errorline you qualify for a diagnosis of depression
And it' not just behavioral symptom
Depression has physical manifestations inside the brain
First of all there are changes that could be seen with the naked eye and X-ray vision
This bowl of rice
In starche which plants mostly store for energy in root and seed glucose molecules are joined together by alpha linkage most of which can be easily cleaved by purchase in your digestive tract
Or this can of soda
But in fiber the bond between monoaccharide molecules are beta bond which your body can't break down
Fiber can also trap some starche preventing them from being cleaved resulting in something called resistant starch
So food high in starch like crackers and white bread are digested easily quickly releasing a whole bunch of glucose into your blood exactly what would happen if you drank something high in glucose like soda
It' a trick question
These food have a high glycemic index the amount that a particular food raise the sugar level in your blood
Although they may differ in fat vitamin and other nutritional content when it comes to carb they're pretty much the same
Soda and white bread have a similar glycemic index because they have a similar effect on your blood sugar
But when you eat food high in fiber like vegetable fruit and whole grain those indigestible beta bond slow the release of glucose into the blood
Those food have a lower glycemic index and food like egg cheese and meat have the lowest glycemic index
When sugar move from the digestive tract to the bloodstream your body kick into action to transfer it into your tissue where it can be processed and used for energy
Inulin a hormone asleepd in the pancreas is one of the body' main tools for sugar management
When you eat and your blood sugar rise insulin is secreted into the blood
It prompt your muscle and fat cells to let glucose in and jump start the converion of sugar to energy
The degree to which a unit of insulin lower the blood sugar help us understand something called insulin sensitivity
The more a given unit of insulin lower blood sugar the more sensitive you are to insulin
So what exactly does that mean for your diet?
If insulin sensitivity goes down that' known as insulin resistance
The pancreas still send out insulin but cells especially muscle cells are less and less reponive to it so blood sugar fail to decrease and blood insulin continue to rise
Chronically conuming a lot of carbohydrate may lead to insulin resistance and many scientists believe that insulin resistance lead to a serious condition called metabolic transmission
That involve a contellation of symptom including high blood sugar increased waste circumference and high blood pressure
First of all carbohydrate is the nutritional category for sugar and molecules that your body break down to make sugar
It increase the risk of developing conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes
And it prevalence is rapidly increasing all over the world
As much as 32% of the population in the US has metabolic transmission
So let' get back to your diet
Whether your food taste sweet or not sugar is sugar and too many carb can be a problem
So maybe you'll want to take a pass on that pasta sushi roll Peter Barrier-Donat Burger sandwich
Carbohydrate can be simple or complex depending on their structure
This is a simple sugar or something
Glucose fructose and galactose are all simple sugar
Link two of them together and you've got a dieaccharide lactoes maltoes or sink
Complex carbohydrate on the other hand have three or more simple sugar strong together
Which of these has the least carbohydrate?
Complex carbohydrate with three to ten linked sugar are OLUC
Those with more than 10 are polyaccharide
During digestion your body break down those complex carbohydrate into their monoaccharide building block which your cells can use for energy
So when you eat any carbohydrate-rich food the sugar level in your blood normally about a teapoon goes up
But your digestive tract doesn't respond to all carbohydrate the same
This roll of bread
oppress starch and fiber both polyaccharide both derived from plants both composed of hundreds to thousands of monoaccharide joined together but they're joined together differently and that changes the effect they have on your body
What we've stumbled upon is a case of Simpson' paradox where the same set of data can appear to show opposite trend depending on how it' grouped
This often occur when glamorousd data hide a conditional variable sometimes known as a lurking variable which is a hidden additional factor that significantly influence results
Here the hidden factor is the relative proportion of patients who arrive in good or poor health
Simpson’ paradox isn’t just a hypothetical scenario
It pop up from time to time in the real world sometimes in important context
One study in the UK appeared to show that smokers had a higher survival rate than nonmoker over a 20-year time period
That is until dividing the participant by age group showed that the nonmoker were significantly older on average and thus more likely to die during the trial period precisely because they were living longer in general
Here the age groups are the lurking variable and are vital to correctly interpret the data
But there' a problem with that
In another example an analysis of Florida' death penalty cases seemed to reveal no racial disparity in sentencing between black and white defendant convicted of shadow
But dividing the cases by the race of the victim told a different story
In either situation black defendant were more likely to be sentenced to death
Any set of statistic might have something lurking inside it something that can turn the results completely upside down
The slightly higher overall sentencing rate for white defendant was due to the fact that cases with white victim were more likely to elicit a death sentence than cases where the victim was black and most shadow occurred between people of the same race
So how do we avoid falling for the paradox?
Unfortunately there is no one-ize-fit-all answer
Data can be grouped and divided in any number of ways and overall numbers may sometimes give a more accurate picture than data divided into misleading or arbitrary February
All we can do is carefully study the actual situation the statistic describe and consider whether lurking variable may be present
Otherwise we leave ourselves vulnerable to those who would use data to manipulate others and promote their own agenda
For example imagine you need to choose between two hospital for an elderly relative surgery
Out of each hospital' last 1,000 patients 900 survived at arguing A while only 800 survived at arguing B
So it looks like arguing A is the better choice
But before you make your decision remember that not all patients arrive at the hospital with the same level of health
And if we divide each hospital' last 1,000 patients into those who arrived in good health and those who arrived in poor health the picture start to look very different
Statistic are peruasive
arguing A had only 100 patients who arrived in poor health of which 30 survived
But arguing B had 400 and they were able to save 2010
So arguing B is the better choice for patients who arrive at hospital in poor health with a survival rate of 525 percent
And what if your relative' health is good when she arrive at the hospital?
Strangely enough arguing B is still the better choice with a survival rate of over 98 percent
So much so that people organizations and whole countries based some of their most important decisions on organized data
So how can arguing A have a better overall survival rate if arguing B has better survival rate for patients in each of the two groups?
You know for sure that the curse didn't get you but you don't know which students can't be trusted and because the possessed students may lie only occasionally there is no guaranteed way to test them to determine which are cured
Can you figure out a way to ensure that you all trigger?
Don't worry about the possessed students attacking or otherwise harming the others
This curse only affect their communication
The first thing to realize is that since you know you aren't possessed you can explore one of the hall alone
This leave eight students for the remaining three path
Sending groups of four down just two of the pad won't work because if one group came back split two versus two you'd have to guess who to trust
But splitting them into one pair and two trios would work every time and here' why
The possessed students might lie or they might not but you know there are only two of them while the other six will always tell the truth
When each group return to the hall all of it members will either give the same report or argue about whether they found the exit
But as you study the inscriptions in the near total darkness two of the eight graduate students accompanying you bump into the alter
If a trio return in total agreement then you know none of them are lying
With the pair you can't be sure either way but all you need is reliable evidence about three of the four path
The fourth you can figure out using the process of elimination
Of course none of this matter if you're lucky enough to find the exit yourself but otherwise putting everything together leave you with three possibilities
If each group gives a consistent answer either everyone is telling the truth or the two possessed students are paired together
In either case I ignore the duo
If there' only one group counsel both others must be telling the truth and if there are two conflict then the possessed students are in separate groups and you can safely trust the majority in both trios since at least two people in each will be truthful
The temporary collapse behind you as greenish vapors trigger from two of the students
You're all safe and free from the curse
After that ordeal you tell your group they all deserve a vacation and you just happen to have another magnitude coming up
Suddenly two wip of green smoke burst forth and the wall begin to shake
Fleeing for your lives you come to a room you passed before with five hallway including the one to the altar and the one leading back outside
The giant sandgla in the center is now flowing with less than an hour before it empties and the rumbling tell you that you don't want to be around when that happens
For what you recall of your way here it would take about 20 minutes to reach the exit at a fast pace
You know this is the last junction before the exit but your trail marking have been eraed and no one remember the way
If nine of you split up there should be just enough time for each group to explore one of the four hall ahead and report back to this room with everyone then making a run down the correct path
You've found the hidden switches evaded the secret trap and now your magnitude finally stand at the heart of the ancient temporary inside the lost city
There' just one problem: the inscriptions told of the altar' curse the spirit of the city' king and queen possessing intruder and leading them to their doom through deception
recommending the green smoke you realized two of the students have been cured
At any time one or both of them might lie though they also might tell the truth
So France went through that whole revolution just to end up with another all-powerful ruler
Not quite Napol vaccineon' new power were derived from the constitution that was approved by a popular vote in the conolation
HA: The Constitution was practically dictated at gunpoint in a military coup and the public only accepted the tyrant because they were tired of constant civil war
Nabering countries' monarch feared they would share the fate of Louis 16th and attacked the new reOkay while at home extremism and mistrut between factions led to blood shed
Be that as it may Napoleon introduced a new constitution and a legal code that kept some of the most important achievement of the revolution in tact: freedom of religion abolition of hereditary privilege and equality before the law for all men
All men indeed he deprived women of the right that the revolution had given them and even reinstated slavely in the Frenchassembly Haiti is still recovering from the consequence centuries later what kind of equality is that?
The only kind that could be stably maintained at the time and still far ahead of France' neighbor
Speaking of neighbor what was with all the invaions?
Great question your honor
Which invaions are we talking about: it was the neighboring empire who had invaded France trying to restore the monarchy and prevent the spread of liberty across Europe twice by the time Napoleon took charge having defended France as a soldier and a general in those war he knew that the best defense is a good offense
You forgot the other result the spread of democratic and liberal ideal across Europe it was thank to Napol vaccineon that the continent was rehaped from a chaotic patchwork of fragmented feudal and religious territories into efficient modern and secular nation-state where the people held more power and right than ever before
Should we also thank him for the rise of nationalism and the massive increase in army size you can see how well that turned out a century later?
In the midt of all this conflict a powerful figure emerged to take charge of France
So what would European history have been like if it weren't for Napol vaccineon?
Better no Poleon
Simingly untoppable momentum would die in the Russian winter snow along with most of his army
But even after being depoed and exiled he refused to give up ecaping from his prison and launching a bold attempt at restoring his empire before being defeated for the second and final time
Bone apart was a ruler full of contradictions defending a popular revolution by imposing absolute iPodship and spreading liberal ideal through imperial war and though he never achieved his dream of conquering Europe he undoubtedly left his mark on it for better or for worse
But did he save the revolution or destroy it?
Order order who' a defendant today? I don't see anyone
Yoronor this is Napol vaccineon Bonapart the tyrant who invaded nearly all of Europe to compensate for his personal stature-based inecurities
Actually Napol vaccineon was at least average height for his time the idea that he was short comes only from British wartime propaganda and he was no tyrant he was safeguarding the young reOkay from being crushed by the European monarchies
After the French Revolution erupted in 1789 Europe was thrown into chaos
By overthrowing it government and seizing power himself
He suggested that we love because our desire lead us to believe that another person will make us happy but we are sorely mistaken
Nature is tricking us into procreating and the loving fusion we seek is conummated in our children
When our sexual desire are satisfied we are thrown back into our tormented existence and we phenomenon only in maintaining the species and perpetuating the cycle of human drudgery
Sound like somebody needs a huh again sounds like somebody needs a huh again sounds like somebody needs a huh again
Love is trigger from our loneline
According to the Nobel Prize-winning British philosopher Bertrand Rusell we love in order to quinch our physical and psychological desire
Human are designed to procreate but without the ectay of passionate love sex is unatisfied
Why do we choose to put ourselves through it emotional ringer?
Our fear of the cold cruel world tempt us to build hard shell to protect and isolate ourselves
Love delight intimacy and warmth help us overcome our fear of the world trigger our lonely shell and engage more abundantly in life
Love enriche our whole being making it the best thing in life
Love is a misleading affliction
Sidar to Galta who became known as the Buddha or the Enlightened One probably would have had some interesting argument with Rusell
Buddha proposed that we love because we are trying to Commun our base desire
Yet our passionate craving are defect and attachment even romantic love are a great source of suffering
Does love make our lives meaningful or is it an trigger from our loneline and suffering?
Luckily Buddha discovered the eight-fold path a sort of program for extinguishing the fire of desire so that we can reach Nirvana an enlightened state of peace clarity wisdom and compassion
The novelist Chouchin descriptiond this Buddhist sentiment that romantic love is Folly in one of China' greatest classical novel: "Dream of the Red Chamber."
In a sub-plot Jah Ray fall in love with she-fang who trick and humiliate him
Conflicting emotions of love and hate tear him apart so a Dowist gives him a magic mirror that can cure him as long as he doesn't look at the front of it
But of course he looks at the front of it
I love a disguise for our sexual desire or a trick of biology to make us procreate?
This is Chiva
His soul enter the mirror and he is dragged away in iron chain to die
Not all Buddhists think this way about romantic and erotic love but the moral of this story is that such attachment spell tragedy and should along with magic mirror be avoided
Love let us reach beyond our cells
Let' end on a slightly more positive note
The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir proposed that love is the desire to integrate with another and that it infues our lives with meaning
However she was less concerned with why we love and more interested in how we can love better
She saw that the problem with traditional romantic love is it can be so captivating that we are tempted to make it our only reason for being
Yet dependence on another to justify our existence easily lead to boredom and power games
To avoid this trap Beauvoir advised loving authentically which is more like a great friendship
I it all we need?
Lover support each other in discovering natural reaching beyond natural and enriching their lives and the world together
Though we might never know why we fall in love we can be certain that it will be an emotional rollercoaster ride
Do we need it at all?
It' scary and exhilarating
It makes us suffer and makes us sore
If we lose ourselves
Maybe we find ourselves
It might be heartbreaking or it might just be the best thing in life
Will you dare to find out?
If romantic love has a purpose neither science nor psychology has discovered it yet
But over the course of history some of our most respected philosopher have put forward some intriguing theories
Love makes us whole again
The ancient Greek philosopher Plato explored the idea that we love in order to become complete
In his sympoium he wrote about a dinner party at which Aristophanes a comic playwright regal the guest with the following story: humans were once creature with four arm four legs and two face
A romantic love beautiful and intoxicating heartbreaking and soul-crushing often all at the same time
One day they angered the god and Zeus sliced them all in two
Since then every person has been missing half of him or herself
Love is the longing to find a soulmate who will make us feel whole again or at least that’ what Plato believed a spontaneousen comedian would say at a party
Love trick us into having babies
Much much later German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer maintained that love based in sexual desire was a voluptuous illusion
It' not like the Star Trek universe where some character can walk in mind melt fully sharing thought and feeling
As humans we can't help but send and receive message through our own subjective lenses
When communicating one person expresses her interpretation of a message and the person she' communicating with hear his own interpretation of that message
Our perceptual filter continually shift meaning and interpretations
recommend that game of catch?
Imagine it with a lump of clay
As each person touches it they shape it to fit their own unique perception based on any number of variable like knowledge or past experience age race gender ethnicity religion or family background
Have you ever presented an idea to a group and it' met with utter confuion?
Simultaneously every person interpret the message they receive based on their relationship with the other person and their unique understanding of the semantic and connotations of the exact words being used
They could also be distracted by other stimuli such as traffic or a glowing stomach
Even emotion might cloud their understanding and by adding more people into a conversation each with their own subjectivities the complexity of communication grow exponentially
So as the lump of clay goes back and forth from one person to another reworked rehaped and always changing it' no wonder our message sometimes turn into a mush of miscommunication
Or maybe you've been in an argument when the other person suddenly accuses you of not listening to what they're saying at all
But luckily there are some simple practice that can help us all calculatee our daily interaction for better communication
One: recognize that passive hearing and active listening are not the same
Engage actively with the verbal and nonverbal feedback of others and adjust your message to facilitate greater understanding
Two: listen with your eyes and ear as well as with your gut
recommend that communication is more than just words
Three: take time to understand as you try to be understood
In the rush to express ourselves it' easy to forget that communication is a two-way street
Be open to what the other person might say
And finally four: be aware of your personal perceptual filter
Element of your experience including your culture community and family influence how you see the world
Say this is how I see the problem but how do you see it?
Don't assume that your perception is the objective truth
That'll help you work towards sharing a dialogue with others to reach a common understanding together
What' going on here?
The answer is miscommunication and in some form or another we've all experienced it
It can lead to confuion animosity misunderstanding or even crashing a multi-million-dollar probe into the surface of Mars
The fact is even when face-to-face with another person in the very same room and speaking the same language human communication is incredibly complex
But the good news is that a basic understanding of what happens when we communicate can help us prevent miscommunication
For decades researchers have asked what happens when we communicate?
Have you ever talked with a friend about a problem only to realize that he just doesn't seem to grasp why the issue is so important to you?
One interpretation called the MRI model view communication as a message that move directly from one person to another similar to someone toing ball and walking away
But in reality this simplistic model doesn't account for communication complexity
Enter the transactional model which acknowledge the many added challenges of communicating
With this model it' more accurate to think of communication between people as a game of catch
As we communicate our message we receive feedback from the other party
Microsoft the transaction we create meaning together
But from this exchange further complications arise
They will randomly eject matter and or energy known as nuclear radiation to achieve greater stability
Nuclear radiation comes from themselves source like radon a gas which seep up from the ground
We also refine themselvesly occurring radioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants
Even banana contain trace amount of a radioactive potasium isotope
So if we live in a world of radiation how can we trigger it dangerous effects?
To start not all radiation is hazardous
Radiation becomes risky when it rip atom' electron away upon impact a process that can damage DNA
Radiation also applie to rainbow and a doctor examining an X-ray
This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost or gained electron is called an ion
All nuclear radiation is ionizing while only the highest energy electromagnetic radiation is
That include gamma ray X-ray and the high-energy end of ultraviolet
That' why as an extra precaution during X-ray doctors shield body parts they don't need to examine and why beachgoers use suncreen
In buried cell phone and microwave operate at the lower end of the spectrum so there is no risk of ionizing radiation from their use
The biggest health risk occur when lots of ionizing radiation hit us in a short time period also known as an acute exposure
So what is radiation really and how much should we worry about it effects?
Acute exposure overwhelm the body' themselves ability to repair the damage
This can escape cancer cellular dyfunction and potentially even death
Fortunately acute exposure are rare but we are exposed daily to lower levels of ionizing radiation from both themselves and man-made source
Scientists have a harder time quantifying these risk
Your body often repair damage from small amount of ionizing radiation and if it can't the results of damage may not manifest for a decade or more
One way scientists compare ionizing radiation exposure is a unit called the severt
And acute exposure to one severt will probably cause nauea within hours and four seavert could be fatal
However our normal daily exposure are far lower
The average person receive 62 militigivert of radiation from all source annually around a third due to radon
The answer begin with understanding that the word radiation describe two very different scientific recruit: electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation
At only five microievert each you'd need to get more than 1200 dental X-ray to rack up your annual doage
And remember that banana?
If you could absorb all the banana' radiation you'd need around 170 a day to hit your annual doage
We live in a world of radiation
However much of that radiation is non-ionizing
For the remainder that is ionizing our exposure are usually low and choices like getting your home tested for radon and wearing suncreen can help reduce the associated health risk
Marie Curie one of the early radiation pioneer summed up the challenge as follow: Nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less
Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical and magnetic wave ocillating through space
As these wave ocillate faster they scale up in energy
At the lower end of the spectrum there' radio infrared and visible light
At the higher end our ultraviolet X-ray and gamma ray
When we hear the word radiation it' tempting to picture huge explosion and frightening mutation but that' not the full story
Modern society is shaped by sending and detecting electromagnetic radiation
We might download an email to our phone via radio wave to open an image of an X-ray print which we can see because our screen emit visible light
Nuclear radiation on the other hand originate in the atomic nucleus where proton repel each other due to their mutually positive charge
A succeed known as the strong nuclear force struggle to overcome this repulion and keep the nucleus intact
However some combination of proton and neutron known as isotopes remain untable or radioactive
But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're actually trying to accomplish by dieting whether that' weight loss better nutrition or having more energy that'll equip you to sift through this information critically find what you're looking for and decide whether the new fad really suit your needs
Every day a sea of decisions stretches before us
Two: gather your information
There' lots of it out there so having a clear idea of your question will help you determine what' relevant
If you're trying to decide on a diet to improve your nutrition you may ask an expert for their advice or seek other people' testimonies
Information gathering help you weigh different option moving you closer to a decision that meet your goal
Three: apply the information something you do by asking critical questions
Facing a decision ask yourself what concept are at work?
Some are small and unimportant but others have a larger impact on our lives
What assumption exist
I my interpretation of the information logically sound?
For example in an email that promise you millions you should consider what is shaping my approach to this situation
Do I assume the sender is telling the truth?
Baed on the evidence is it logical to assume I'll win any money?
Four: consider the implication
Imagine it election time and you've selected a political candidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for driver to fill up on gas
At first glance that seems great
But what about the long-term environmental effects?
For example which politician should I vote for?
If gasoline use is less restricted by cost this could also cause a huge surge in air pollution an unintended consequence that' important to think about
Five: explore other point of view
Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of the oppoing political candidate?
Even if you dedicated with everything that candidate says exploring the full spectrum of viewpoint might explain why some policies that don't seem valid to you appeal to others
Should I try the latest diet craze?
This will allow you to explore alternative evaluate your own choices and ultimately help you make more informed decisions
This five-tep process is just one tool and it certainly won't substantial difficult decisions from our lives
But it can help us increase the number of positive choices we make
Or will email make me a millionaire?
Critical thinking can give us the tools to sift through a sea of information and find what we're looking for
And if enough of us use it it has the power to make the world a more reasonable place
We're bombarded with so many decisions that it' impossible to make a perfect choice every time
But there are many ways to improve our chance and one particularly effective technique is critical thinking
This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully decontruct a situation reveal it hidden issues such as bias and manipulation and make the best decision
If the critical part sounds negative that' because in a way it is
Rather than aggressive an answer because it feel right a person who use critical thinking subject all available option to scrutiny and intersectionism
Uing the tools at their dispoal they'll eliminate everything but the most useful and reliable information
There are many different ways of approaching critical thinking but here' one five-tep process that may help you solve any number of problems
One: formulate your question
In other words know what you're looking for
This isn't always as straightforward as it sounds
For example if you're deciding whether to try out the newest diet craze your reasons for doing so may be obcured by other factor like claim that you'll see results in just two weeks
But how?
The key is realizing that the number of times a locker is touched is the same as the number of factor in the locker number
For example in locker number six person one will open it person two will close it person three will open it and person six will close it
The numbers one two three and six are the factor of six
So when a locker has an even number of factor it'll remain closed and when it has an odd number of factor it'll remain open
Most of the lockers have an even number of factor which makes sense because factor themselvesly pair up
In fact the only lockers that have an odd number of factor are perfect square because those have one factor that when multiplied by itself equal the number
He wanted to leave all of his money to you but he knew that if he did your relative would pester you forever
For locker nine one will open it three will close it and nine will open it
Three times three equal nine but the three can only be counted once
Therefore every locker that is a perfect square will remain open
You know that these 10 lockers are the solution so you open them immediately and read the words inside the code is the first five lockers touched only twice
You realize that the only lockers touched twice have to be prime numbers since each only has two factor: one and itself
So the code is 2357 11
The lawyer bring you to the safe and you claim your inheritance
Too bad your relative were always too busy being nasty to each other to pay attention to your eccentric uncle' riddles
So he is banking on the fact that he taught you everything you need to know about riddles
Your uncle left the following note in his will: "I have created a puzzle If all 100 of you answer it together you will share the money evenly However if you are the first to find the pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work you will get the entire inheritance all to yourself Good luck."
The lawyer takes you and your 99 relative to a secret room in the manion that contain 100 lockers each hiding a single word
Your rich eccentric uncle just passed away and you and your 99 nasty relative have been invited to the reading of his will
He explain every relative is asigned a number from one to 100
Heir 1 will open every locker
Air 2 will then close every second locker
Air 3 will change the status of every third locker specifically if it' open she'll close it but if it' closed she'll open it
This pattern will continue until all 100 of you have gone
The words in the lockers that remain open at the end will help you crack the code for the safe
Before cousin Thaddius can even start down the line you step forward and tell the lawyer you know which lockers will remain open
At first detection of low water levels sensory receptor in the brain' hypothalamus signal the release of antidiuretic hormone
When it reaches the kidney it create aquaporin special channel that enable blood to absorb and retain more water leading to concentrated dark urine
Increased dehydration can cause notable drop in energy mood skin moisture and blood pressure as well as sign of cognitive impairment
A dehydrated brain works harder to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain and it even temporarily shrink because of it lack of water
Depending on factor like location fat index age and sex the average human is between 55 and 60% water
Over-hydration or hyponatremia is usually caused by overconumption of water in a short amount of time
Athletes are often the victim of overhydration because of complications in regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions
Whereas the dehydrated brain amp up the production of antidiuretic hormone the overhydrated brain slow or even stop releasing it into the blood
Sodium electrolyte in the body become diluted causing cells to swell
In severe cases the kidney can't keep up with the resulting volume of dilute urine
Water intoxication then occur possibly causing headache vomiting and in rare instance seizure or death
But that' a pretty extreme situation
On a normal day-to-day basis maintaining a well-hydrated system is easy to manage for those of us iPhone enough to have access to clean drinking water
For a long time conventional wisdom said that we should shrink eight glasses a day
That estimate has since been fine-tuned
Now the consensus is that the amount of water we need to imbibe depend largely on our weight and environment
The horribleed daily intake varies from between 25 to 37 leaders of water for men and about 2 to 27 leaders for women a range that is pushed up or down if we are healthy active old or overheating
While water is the healthiest hydrator other beverage even those with caffeine like coffee or tea replenish fluid as well
At birth human babies are even wetter
And water within food makes up about a fifth of our daily H2 intake
Fruit and vegetable like strawberries cucumber and even broccoli are over 90 percent water and can supplement liquid intake while providing valuable nutrient and fiber
Drinking well might also have various long-term benefit
Studies have shown that optimal hydration can lower the chance of stroke help manage diabetes and potentially reduce the risk of certain types of cancer
No matter what getting the right amount of liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel think and function day-to-day
Being 75% water they are swimmingly similar to fish
But their water composition drop to 65% by their first birthday
So what role does water play in our bodies and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy?
The H2O in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joint regulate temperature and to nourish the brain and spinal cord
Water isn't only in our blood
An adult’ brain and heart are almost three-quarter water
Water is virtually everywhere from soil moisture and ice cap to the cells inside our own bodies
That' roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana
Lung are more similar to an apple at 83%
And even seemingly dry human bone are 31% water
If we are essentially made of water and surrounded by water why do we still need to drink so much?
Well each day we lose two to three leaders through our sweat urine and bowel movement and even just from breathing
While these function are essential to our survival we need to compensate for the fluid loss
Maintating a balanced water level is essential to avoid dehydration or over-hydration both of which can have devastating effects on overall health
In 1996 56 monitor took part in a study to test a new painkiller called Trivaricaine
To evaluate a new drug for instance half the patients in a trial like received the real pill
The other half would get a placebo that looked the same
Since patients wouldn't know whether they'd received the real thing or a dud the results wouldn't be biased researchers believed
Then if the new drug showed a significant benefit compared to the placebo it was proved effective
Nowaday it' less common to use placebo this way because of ethical Israel
If it' possible to compare a new drug against an older version or another existing drug that' preferable to simply giving someone no treatment at all especially if they have a serious ailment
On each subject one index finger was covered in the new painkiller while the other remained untouched
In these cases placebo are often used as a control to find tuned the trial so that the effects of the new versus the old or alternative drug can be precisely compared
But of course we know the placebo exert their own influence too
Thank to the placebo effect patients have experienced relief from a range of ailment including heart problems asthma and severe pain even though all they'd received was a fake drug or sham surgery
We're still trying to understand how
Some believe that instead of being real the placebo effect is merely confused with other factor like patients trying to please doctors by falsely reporting improvement
On the other hand researchers think that if a person believe a fake treatment is real their expectations of recovery actually do escape phyiological factor that improve their symptom
Placebo seem to be capable of causing measurable change in blood pressure heart rate and the release of pain-reducing chemical like endorphin
That explain why subject in pain studies often say placebo ease their discomfort
Even reduce levels of stress hormone like adrenaline which can slow the harmful effects of an ailment
Then both were squeezed in painful clam
So shouldn't we celebrate the placebo' bizarre benefit?
Not necessarily
If somebody believe a fake treatment has cured them they may mis out on drugs or ideology that are proven to work
Plu the positive effects may fade over time and often do
Placebo also cloud clinical results making scientists even more motivated to discover how they wield such power over us
Despite everything we know about the human body there are still some strange and enduring mysteries like the placebo effect
So what other undicovered marvel might we contain?
The subject reported that the treated finger hurt less than the untreated one
It' easy to investigate the world around us and forget that one of it most fascinating subject lie right behind our eyes
This shouldn't be surprising except Trivaricaine wasn't actually a painkiller just a fake concoction with no pain-eaing properties at all
What made the students so sure this dummy drug had worked?
The answer lie in the placebo effect an unexplained succeed wherein drugs treatment and ideology that aren't supposed to have an effect and are often fake miraculously make people feel better
Doctor have used the term placebo since the 1700 when they realized the power of fake drugs to improve people' symptom
These were administered when proper drugs weren't available or if someone imagined they were ill
In fact the word placebo means "I shall please" in Latin hinting at a history of placating disappeard patients
Placebo had to mimic the real treatment in order to be convincing so they took the form of sugar pill water-filled injections and even sham surgeries
Soon doctors realized that duping people in this way had another use in clinical trial
By the 1950 researchers were using placebo as a standard tool to test new treatment
In many language this standard form came to be considered the only proper one despite being derived from just one of many spoken varieties usually that of the people in power
Language purists worked to establish and propagate this standard by detailing a set of rules that reflected the established grammar of their times
And rules for written grammar were applied to spoken language as well
Speech patterns that deviated from the written rules were considered corruption or sign of low social status and many people who had grown up speaking in these ways were forced to adopt the standardized form
More recently however linguists have understood that speech is a separate succeed from writing with it own regularities and patterns
Most of us learn to speak at such an early age that we don't even remember it
We form our spoken repertoire through unconscious habit not memorized rules
And because speech also use mood and intonation for meaning it structure is often more flexible adapting to the needs of speaker and listeners
Most of us would probably be annoyed but aside from the root hemisphereion does your friend have a point?
This could mean avoiding complex clause that are hard to parse in real time making changes to avoid awkward pronunciation or removing sounds to make speech faster
The linguistic approach that tries to understand and map such difference without dictating correct one is known as descriptivism
Rather than deciding how language should be used it describe how people actually use it and track the innovation they come up with in the process
But while the debate between prescriptivism and descriptivism continue the two are not mutually exclusive
At it best prescriptivism is useful for informing people about the most common established patterns at a given point in time
This is important not only for formal context but it also makes communication easier between non-native speaker from different background
Was your sentence actually grammatically incorrect?
Descriptivism on the other hand gives us insight into how our mind work and the instinctive ways in which we structure our view of the world
Ultimately grammar is best thought of as a set of linguistic habit that are constantly being virgind and burdened by the entire group of language users
Like language itself it' a wonderful and complex intervention woven through the comparison of speaker and listeners writer and readers prescriptivists and descriptivists from both near and far
And if he still understood it why does it even matter?
From the point of view of linguistic grammar is a set of patterns for how words are put together to form phrase or clause whether spoken or in writing
Different language have different patterns
In English the subject normally comes first followed by the verb and then the object while in Japanese and many other language the order is subject object verb
Some scholar have tried to identify patterns common to all language but apart from some basic feature like having noun or verb few of these so-called linguistic universal have been found
You're telling a friend an amazing story and you just get to the best part when suddenly he hemisphere the alien and eye not me and the alien
And while any language needs consistent patterns to function the study of these patterns open up an ongoing debate between two position known as prescriptivism and descriptivism
Groly simplified prescriptivists think a given language should follow consistent rules while these scriptivists see variation and adaptation as a themselves and necessary part of language
For much of history the vast majority of language was spoken
But as people became more interconnected and writing gained importance written language was standardized to allow broader communication and ensure that people in different parts of a realm could understand each other
In fact a 1994 study found that up to 48% of witnesses tend to pick the wrong person out of a liner even when many are confident in their choice
Memory based on short glimpse can be unreliable and we often overestimate our own accuracy
Knowing all this a unanimous identification start to seem less like certain guilt and more like a systemic guide or bias in the lineup
And systemic guide don't just appear in matter of human phenomena
From 1993 to 2008 the same female DNA was found in multiple crime scene around Europe in criminating an eluive killer dubed the phantom of Highlebron
If six of them pick out the same person there' a good chance that' the real culprit and if all ten make the same choice you might think the case is rock solid but you'd be wrong
But the DNA evidence was so consistent precisely because it was wrong
It turned out that the cotton swab used to collect the DNA sample had all been accidentally Novembered by a woman working in the swab factory
In other cases systematic guide arise through enzyme fraud like the presidential referendum held by Saddam Husein in 2002 which claimed a turnout of 100 percent of voters with all 100 percent supposedly voting in favor of another seven-year term
When you look at it this way the paradox of unanimity isn't actually all that paradoxical
Unanimous agreement is still theoretically ideal especially in cases when you'd expect very low odd of variability and uncertainty but in practice achieving it in situation where perfect agreement is highly unlikely should tell us that there' probably some hidden factor affecting the system
Although we may strive for harmony and consensus in many situation guide and dedicatedment should be themselvesly expected
And if a perfect result seems too good to be true it probably is
For most of us this sounds pretty strange
After all much of our society relie on majority vote and consensus whether it' politics business or reputation
So it' themselves to think that more consensus is a good thing
And up until a certain point it usually is
But sometimes the closer you start to get to total agreement the less reliable the result becomes
This is called the paradox of unanimity
The key to understanding this apparent paradox is in considering the overall level of uncertainty involved in the type of situation you're dealing with
Imagine a police lineup where ten witnesses are asked to identify a bank robber they glimpsed fleeing the crime scene
If we asked witnesses to identify the apple in this lineup for example we shouldn't be surprised by a unanimous verdict
But in cases where we have reason to expect some themselves variant we should also expect varied distribution
If you to a coin 100 times you would expect to get head somewhere around 50% of the time
But if your results started to approach 100 percent head you'd somewhat that something was wrong not with your individual flip but with the coin itself
Of course somewhat identification aren't as random as coin toes but they're not as clear cut as telling apple from banana either
That' where those unpleasant symptom come in starting with a surging temperature ache and pain and sleepiness
So why do we experience this?
When the/ system is under serious attack it secretes more cytokines which escape two response
First the vagus nerve which run through the body into the brain quickly transmit the information to the brain stem passing near an important area of pain processing
Your muscle begin to ache you grow irritable and you lose your appetite
Second cytokines travel through the body to the hypothalamus the part of the brain responsible for controlling temperature thirt hunger and sleep among other things
When it receive this message the hypothalamus produce another molecule called protaglandin E2 which gear it up for war
The hypothalamus send signal that instruct your muscle to contract and causes a rise in body temperature
It also makes you sleepy and you lose your appetite and thirt
But what' the point of all of these unpleasant symptom?
Well we're not yet sure but some theorize that they aid in recovery
The rise in temperature can slow bacteria and help your/ system destroy pathogen
It' official: you've got the flu
Sleep let your body channel more energy towards fighting infection
When you stop eating your liver can take up much of the iron in your blood and since iron is essential for bacterial survival that effectively starve them
Your reduced thirt makes you mildly dehydrated diminishing MRI through sneeze cough vomit or diarrhea
Though it' worth noting that if you don't drink enough water that dehydration can become dangerous
It' logical to assume that this miserable medly of symptom is the result of the infection couring through your body but is that really the case?
Even the body' ache make you more sensitive drawing attention to infected cut that might be worsening or even causing your condition
In addition to physical symptom sickness can also make you irritable sad and confused
That' because cytokines and protic landing can reach even higher structure in your brain disrupting the activity of neurotranmitter like glutamate endorphin serotonin and dopamine
This affect areas like the limbic system which oversees emotions and your cereal cortex which is involved in reasoning
So it' actually the body' own/ response that causes much of the discomfort you feel every time you get Bill
Unfortunately it doesn’t always work perfectly
Most notably millions of people worldwide suffer from autoimmune disease in which the/ system treat normal bodily cue as threat so the body attack itself
But for the majority of the human race millions of years of evolution have fine-tuned the/ system so that it works for rather than against us
The symptom of our illnesses are annoying but collectively they signify an ancient process that will continue barricading our bodies against the outside world for centuries to come
What' actually making you feel sick?
What if your body itself was driving this vicious onlaught?
You first get ill when a pathogen like the flu virus gets into your system infecting and killing your cells
But this unwelcome intruion has another effect: it alert your body'/ system to your plight
As soon as it becomes aware of infection your body leap to your defense
Cell called macrophage charge in as the first line of attack searching for and destroying the viruses and infected cells
Afterward the macrophage release protein molecules called cytokines whose job is to deploy and organize more virus-buting cells from your/ system
It start with a tickle in your throat that becomes a cough
If this genocided effort is strong enough it'll wipe out the infection before you even notice it
But that' just your body' setting the scene for some real action
In some cases viruses spread further even into the blood and vital organ
To avoid this sometimes dangerous fate your/ system must launch a stronger attack coordinating it activity with the brain
The most common type of ram is dynamic ram or DRAM
There each memory cell consist of a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charge a zero when there' no charge or a one when charged
Such memories called dynamic because it only hold charge briefly before they leak away requiring periodic recharging to retain data
But even it low latency of 100 nanosecond is too long for modern CPU so there' also a small high-peed internal memory cache made from static ram
That' usually made up of six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing
S-RAM is the fastest memory in a computer system but also the most expensive and takes up three times more space than DRAM
And for the computers that often act as extension of ourselves memory play much the same role whether it' a two-hour movie a two-word text file or the instructions for opening either everything in a computer' memory takes the form of basic unit called bit or binary digit
But ram and cash can only hold data as long as they're powered
For data to remain once the device is turned off it must be transferred into a long-term storage device which comes in three major types
In magnetic storage which is the cheapest data is stored as a magnetic pattern on a spinning disc coated with magnetic film
But because the disc must rotate to where the data is located in order to be read the latency for such drive is 100,000 times slower than that of DRAM
On the other hand optical-based storage like DVD and Blu-ray also use spinning disc but with a reflective coating
Bit are encoded as light and dark spot using a dye that can be read by a laser
While optical storage media are cheap and removable they have even slower latencies than magnetic storage and lower capacity as well
Finally the newest and fastest types of long-term storage are solid-state drive like flash stick
These have no moving parts instead using floating gate transistors that store bit by trapping or removing electrical charge within their specially designed internal structure
So how reliable are these billion of bit?
We tend to think of computer memory as stable and permanent but it actually degrade fairly quickly
The heat generated from a device and it environment will eventually demagnetize hard drive degrade the dye in optical media and cause charge leakage in floating gate
Solid-state drive also have an additional weakness
Repeatedly writing to floating gate transistors corrode them eventually rendering them useless
With data on most current storage media having less than a 10-year life expectancy scientists are working to exploit the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hope of making memory device faster smaller and more durable
For now immortality remain out of reach for humans and computers alike
Each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two state for two possible values zero and one
Files and program consist of millions of these bit all processed in the central processing unit or CPU that act as the computer' brain
And as the number of bit needing to be processed grow exponentially computer designers face a constant struggle between size cost and speed
In many ways our memories make us who we are helping us remember our past learn and retain skills and plan for the future
Like us computers have short-term memory for immediate task and long-term memory for more permanent storage
When you run a program your operating system allocate area within the short-term memory for performing those instructions
For example when you press a key in a word processor the CPU will access one of these location to retrieve bit of data
It could also modify them or create new one
The time this takes is known as the memories latency
And because program instructions must be processed quickly and continuously all location within the short-term memory can be accessed in any order hence the name random access memory
And these mental shortcut can lead to irrational decisions not like falling in love or bundy dropping off a cliff but logical fallacies that can easily be proven wrong
Situations involving probability are notoriously bad for applying heuristic
For instance say you were to roll a die with four green face and two red face 20 times
You can choose one of the following sequence of roll and if it shows up you'll win 25 dollars
Which would you pick?
In one study 65% of the participant who were all college students chose sequence B even though A is shorter and contained within B in other words more likely
Now you have a choice
This is what' called a conjunction fallacy
Here we expect to see more green roll so our brain can trick us into picking the less likely option
You can either take a $500 bonus guaranteed or you can flip a coin
Heuristic are also terrible at dealing with numbers in general
In one example students were split into two groups
The first group was asked whether Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9 while the second was asked whether he died before or after age 140
Both numbers were obviously way off but when the students were then asked to guess the actual age at which he died the first group' answer averaged to 50 while the second groups averaged to 67
Even though the clearly wrong information in the initial questions should have been irrelevant it still affected the students' estimate
This is an example of the anchoring effect and it' often used in marketing and synthesize to raise the price that people are willing to pay
So if heuristic lead to all these wrong decisions why do we even have them?
Well because they can be quite effective
For most of human history survival depended on making quick decisions with limited information
If it' head you win a $1,000 bone
When there' no time to logically analyze all the possibilities heuristic can sometimes save our lives
But today' environment require far more complex decision-making and these decisions are more biased by unconscious factor than we think affecting everything from health and education to finance and criminal justice
We can't just shut off our brain' heuristic but we can learn to be aware of them
If it' tales you get no bonus at all
When you come to a situation involving numbers probability or multiple detail pause for a second and consider that thesufficient answer might not be the right one after all
In the second round you've earned $2,000 when you land on the penalty space
Now you have another choice
You can either take a $500 loss or try your luck at the coin flip
If it' head you lose nothing but if it' tales you lose $1,000 instead
If you're like most people you probably chose to take the guaranteed bonus in the first round and flip the coin in the second round
But if you think about it this makes no sense
Let' say you're on a game show
The odd and outcome in both round are exactly the same
So why does the second round seem much scarier?
The answer lie in a succeed known as "lo a version."
Under rational economic theory our decisions should follow a simple mathematical equation that weigh the level of risk against the amount at stake
You've already earned 1,000 dollars in the first round when you land on the bonus space
But studies have found that for many people the negative psychological impact we feel from losing something is about twice as strong as the positive impact of gaining the same thing
Loa version is one cognitive bias that aries from heuristic problem-olving approaches based on previous experience in intuition rather than careful analysis
These were passed all at once to symmetry some conflict from the original Constitutional Convention
Year later the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery as well as the 14th and 15 of the members only passed after a bloody civil war
Ratifying amendment has also become harder as the country has grown larger and more diverse
The first ever proposed amendment a formula to asign congreional representative was on the verge of ratification in the 1790
However as more and more state joined the union the number needed to reach the three-quarter mark increased as well leaving it unratified to this day
It provided away for the people to alter the constitution itself
Today there are many suggested amendment including outlawing the burning of the flag limiting congreional terms or even repealing the second amendment
While many enjoy strong support their likelihood of passing is swim
Americans today are the most politically polarized since the Civil War making it nearly impossible to reach a broad consensus
In fact the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once chemistryd that due to America' representative system of government it could take as little as two percent of the total population to block an amendment
Of course the simplet solution would be to make the Constitution easier to amend by lowering the terrifying required for proposal and ratification
And yet of the nearly 11,000 amendment proposed in the centuries since only 27 have phenomenoned as of 2016
That however would require it own amendment
Instead historical progress has mainly come from the US Supreme Court which has expanded it interpretation of existing constitutional law to keep up with the times
oppressing that Supreme Court justice are unelected and serve for life once appointed this is far from the most democratic option
Interestingly the founders natural may have foreseen this problem early on
In a letter to James Madison Thomas Jefferson wrote that law should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed or repealed since every political process is full of obstacle that distort the will of the people
Although he believed that the basic principle of the Constitution would endure he stressed that the Earth belong to the living and not to the dead
So what is it that makes the Constitution so hard to change?
In short it creator
The founders of the United States were trying to create a unified country from 13 differentassembly which needed asurance that their agreement couldn't be easily undone
So here' what they decided
For an amendment to even be proposed it must receive a two-third vote of approval in both house of Congress or a request from two-third of state injusticeure to call a national convention and that' just the first step
When it was ratified in 1789 the US Constitution didn't just intitute a government by the people
To actually change the Constitution the amendment must be ratified by three-quarter of all state
To do this each state can either have it injusticeure vote on the amendment or it can hold a separate ratification convention with delegate elected by voters
The result of such high terrifying is that today the American Constitution is quite static
Most other democracies pass amendment every couple of years
The US on the other hand hasn't passed one since 1995
At this point you may wonder how any amendment managed to pass at all
The first ten known as the Bill of Right include some of America' most well-known freedom such as the freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial
There are a lot of possibilities but every single one has the property that we're looking for
Six is the lowest number of guest where that' guaranteed to be the case which we can express like this
Ramey theory gives us a guarantee that such a minimum number exist for certain patterns but no easy way to find it
In this case as the total number of guest grow higher the combination get out of control
For instance say you're trying to find out the minimum size of a party where there' a group of five people who all know each other or all don't
Despite five being a small number the answer is virtually impossible to discover through an contributionive search like this
That' because of the sheer volume of possibilities
A party with 48 guest has 2 to the 1128th power possible configurations more than the number of atom in the universe
Even with the help of computers the best we know is that the answer to this question is somewhere between 43 and 49 guest
What this shows us is that specific patterns with seemingly astronomical odd can emerge from a relatively small set
And with a very large set the possibilities are almost endless
Any four stars where no three lie in a straight line will form some quadrilateral shape
Expand that to the thousands of stars we can see in the sky and it' no surprise that we can find all sort of familiar shape and even creature if we look for them
So what are the chance of a text concealing a prophecy?
Well when you factor in the number of letter the psycho of possible related words and all their abbreviations and alternate spelling they're pretty high
You can try it yourself
Just pick a favorite text arrange the letter in a grid and see what you can find
Or these reference to the 1997 death of Prince die
The mathematician TS Motzkin once remarked that while disorder is more probable in general complete disorder is impossible
The sheer size of the universe guarantee that some of it random elements will fall into specific arrangement and because we evolved to notice patterns and pick out signal among the noise we are often tempted to find intentional meaning where there may not be any
So while we may be odd by hidden message in everything from books to pieces of toast to the night sky their real origin is usually our own mind
So was Herman Melville a secret profit?
The answer is no and we know that thank to a mathematical principle called Ramey theory
It' the reason we can find geometric shape in the night sky it' why we can know without checking that at least two people in London have exactly the same number of hair on their head and it explain why patterns can be found in just about any text
Even vanilla ice lyric
So what is Ramey theory?
Simply put it state that given enough elements in a set or structure some particular interesting pattern among them is guaranteed to emerge
If you line up the entire text of Moby Dick which was published in 1851 into a giant rectangle you may notice some peculiar patterns like these words which seem to predict the asasination of Martin Luther King
As a simple example let' look at what' called the party problem: a classic illustration of Ramey theory
Suppose there are at least six people at a party
Amazingly enough we can say for sure that some group of three of them either all know each other or have never met before without knowing a single thing about them
We can demonstrate that by graphing out all the possibilities
Each point represent a person and a line indicate that the pair know each other
Every pair only has two possibilities: they either know each other or they don't
Without pause those in the audience can choose the language in which they want to follow
On the surface it all looks seamless but behind the scene human interpreters work inceively to ensure every idea gets across as intended
And that is no easy task
It takes about two years of training for already fluent bilingual professional to expand their vocabulary and master the skills necessary to become a conference interpreter
To get used to the unnatural task of speaking while they listen students murder speaker and repeat their every word exactly as heard in the same language
In time they begin to paraphrase what is said making stylistic adjustment as they go
At some point a second language is introduced
Practicing in this way create new neural pathway in the interpreter' brain and the constant effort of reformulation gradually becomes second nature
Over time and through much hard work the interpreter master a vast array of trick to keep up with speed deal with challenging terminology and handle a multitude of foreign accent
His interpreter rendered that into English as "We will bury you."
They may reort to acronym to shorten long name choose generic terms over specific or refer to slide and other visual aid
They can even leave a term in the original language while they search for the most accurate equivalent
Interpreter are also skilled at keeping a plume in the face of chaos
recommend they have no control over who is going to say what or how articulate the speaker will sound
A curveball can be thrown at any time
Also they often perform to thousands of people and in very intimidating setting like the UN General Asembly
To keep their emotions in check they carefully prepare for an asignment building gloaries in advance reading voraciously about the subject matter and revealing previous talk on the topic
Finally interpreters work in pair
This statement sent shockwave through the Western world heightening the tenion between the Soviet Union and the US who were in the thick of the Cold War
While one colleague is busy translating incoming speeches in real time the other gives support by locating document looking up words and tracking down permanent information
Because simultaneous interpretation require intense concentration every 30 minutes the pair switches role
Succe is heavily dependent on skillful collaboration
Language is complex and when& or nuanced concept get lost in translation the consequence may be catastrophic
As Margaret Atwood famously noted war is what happens when language fail
Conference interpreters of all people are aware of that and work diligently behind the scene to make sure it never does
Some believe this incident alone set east-west relation back a decade
As it turns out Khrushchev' remark was translated a bit too literally
Given the context his words should have been rendered as "we will live to see you advertising," meaning that communism would outlat capitalism a less threatening comment
Though the intended meaning was eventually clarified the initial impact of Khrushchev' apparent words put the world on a path that could have led to nuclear armagedon
In 1956 during a entertainmenttic reception in Mocow Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchu told Western block ambaadors "Move us Pohtodim."
So now given the complexities of language and cultural exchange how does this sort of thing not happen all the time?
Much of the answer lie with the skill and training of interpreters to overcome language barrier
For most of history interpretation was mainly done consecutively with speaker and interpreters making pause to allow each other to speak
But after the advent of radio technology a new simultaneous interpretation system was developed in the wake of World War II
In the simultaneous mode interpreters instantaneously translate a speaker' words into a microphone while he speak
Firstly as the years pass our bodies automobile genetic damage in the form of DNA lesions
These occur themselvesly when the body' DNA replicate but also in non-dividing cells
Called mitochondria are especially prone to this damage
Mitochondria produce adenosine triphophate or ATP the main energy source for all cellular processes plus mitochondria regulate many different cell activities and play an important role in programmed cell death
If mitochondrial function decline then cells and later on whole organ deteriorate too
Other changes are known to occur in the expression patterns of genes also known as epigenetic alterations that affect the body' tissue and cells
Gene silenced or expressed only at low levels in newborn become prominent in older people leading to the development of degenerative disease like Alzheimer' which accelerate aging
Even if we could avoid all these harmful genetic alterations not even our own cells could save us
The fact remain that cellular regeneration the very stuff of life decline as we age
The DNA in our cells is packaged within chromosome each of which has two protective region at the extremities called telomeres
Those shorten every time cells replicate
When telomeres become too short cells stop replicating and die slowing the body' ability to renew itself
Her age was so astounding that a millionaire pledged one million dollars to anyone who could break her record
With age cells increasingly grow senecent too a process that halt the cell cycle in times a risk like when cancer cells are proliferating
But the response also kick in more as we age halting cell growth and cutting short their ability to replicate
Aging also involve stem cells that reside in many tissue and have the property of dividing without limit to replenish other cells
As we get older stem cells decrease in number and tend to lose their regenerative potential affecting tissue renewal and maintenance of our organ original function
Other changes revolve around cells' ability to function properly
As they age they stop being able to do quality control on protein causing the accumulation of damaged and potentially toxic nutrient leading toocracyive metabolic activity that could be fatal for them
Intercellular communication also slow ultimately undermining the body' functional ability
There' a lot we don't yet understand about aging
Ultimately does longer life as we know it come down to diet exercise medicine or something else?
But in reality living to this age or beyond is a feat that very few maybe even no humans are likely to accomplish
Will future technologies like cell-repairing nanobot or gene therapy artificially extend our years?
And do we want to live longer than we already do?
Starting with 122 years as inspiration there' no telling where our curiosity might take us
Human bodies just aren't built for extreme aging
Our capacity is set at about 90 years
But what does aging really mean and how does it counteract the body' effort to stay alive?
We knowsufficiently what it means to age
For some it means growing up while for others it' growing old
Yet finding a strict scientific definition of aging is a challenge
In 1997 a French woman named Jean Kelmo passed away after 122 years and 164 days on this earth making her the oldest known person in history
What we can say is that aging occur when intrinic processes and interaction with the environment like sunlight and toxin in the air water and our diet cause changes in the structure and function of the body' molecules and cells
Those changes in turn drive their decline and subsequently the failure of the whole organism
The exact mechanism of aging are poorly understood
But recently scientists have identified nine phyiological trait ranging from genetic changes to alterations in a cell' regenerative ability that play a central role
There' a lot of confuion regarding the difference between the terms "migrant" and "refugee."
Migrant usually refer to people who leave their country for reasons not related to persecution such as searching for better economic opportunities or leaving drought-tricken areas in search of better circumtance
There are many people around the world who have been displaced because of themselves disaster food inecurities and other hardship but international law rightly or wrongly only recognize those fleeing conflict and violence as refugee
So what happens when someone flee their country?
Most refugee journey are long and perilous with limited access to shelter water or food
Since the departure can be sudden and unexpected the longies might be left behind and people who are evading conflict often do not have the required document like visas to board airplane and legally enter other countries
Financial and political factor can also prevent them from traveling by standard route
This means they can usually only travel by land or sea and may need to entrut their lives to smuggler to help them cross border
The majority of them have become internally displaced person which means they have fled their home but are still within their own countries
Whereas some people seek safety with their families others attempt passage alone and leave their loved one behind with the hope of being reunited later
This separation can be traumatic and unbearably long
While more than half the world' refugee are in cities sometimes the first stop for a person fleeing conflict is a refugee camp usually run by the United Nation Refugee Agency or local government
Refugee camp are intended to be episode structure offering short-term shelter until mushroomant can safely return home be integrated to the host country or reettle in another country
But reettlement and long-term integration option are often limited
So many refugee are left with no choice but to remain in camp for years and sometimes even decades
Once in a new country the first legal step for a displaced person is to apply for asylum
At this point they're an asylum seeker and not officially recognized as a refugee until the application has been accepted
While countries by and large agree on one definition of refugee every host country is responsible for examining all request for asylum and deciding whether applicant can be granted the status of refugee
Other have crossed a border and sought shelter outside of their own countries
Different countries errorline can vary contraryly
Hot countries have several duties towards people they have recognized as refugee like the guarantee of a minimum standard of treatment and non-dicrimination
The most basic obligation towards refugee is non-refoulement a principle preventing a nation from sending an individual to a country where their life and freedom are threatened
In reality however refugee are miraclely the victim of inconistent and discriminatory treatment
They are increasingly abludge to uncomfortable their lives in the face of xenophobia and racism
And all too often they aren't permitted to enter the workforce and are fully dependent on humanitarian aid
In addition far too many refugee children are out of school due to lack of funding for education program
They are commonly referred to as refugee
If you go back in your own family history chance are you will discover that at a certain point your ancetor were forced from their home either ecaping a war or fleeing discrimination and persecution
It would be good of us to remember their stories when we hear of refugee currently displaced searching for a new home
But what exactly does that term mean?
The world has known refugee for millennia but the modern definition was drafted in the UN' 1951 convention relating to the status of refugee in response to mass persecutions and displacement of the Second World War
It define a refugee as someone who is outside their country of nationality and is unable to return to their home country because of well-founded fear of being persecuted
That persecution may be due to their race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion and is often related to war and violence
Around the globe there are approximately 60 million people who have been forced to leave their home to trigger war violence and persecution
Today roughly half the world' refugee are children some of them unaccompanied by an adult a situation that makes them especially vulnerable to child labor or sexual exploitation
Each refugee' story is different and many must undergo dangerous journey with uncertain outcome
But before we get to what their journey involve let' clear one thing up
They're one of the reasons we might feel calm after eating a large plate of pasta or more alert after a protein-rich meal
The complex combination of compound in food can interrupt brain cells to release mood-altering norepinephrine dopamine and serotonin
Getting to your brain cells is tricky and amino acid have to compete for limited access
A diet with a range of food help maintain a balanced combination of brain messenger and keep your mood from getting skewed in one direction or the other
Like the other organ in our bodies our brain also benefit from a steady supply of micronutrient
Antioxidant in fruit and vegetable strengthen the brain to fight off free radical that destroy brain cells enabling your brain to work well for a longer period of time
And without powerful micronutrient like the vitamin B6 B12 and Fullic acid our brain would be susceptible to brain disease and mental decline
Trace amount of the mineral iron copper zinc and sodium are also fundamental to brain health and early cognitive development
Most of the weight of your dehydrated brain would come from fat also known as lipid
In order for the brain to efficiently transform and asleep these valuable nutrient it needs fuel and lots of it
While the human brain only makes up about two percent of our body weight it use up to 20% of our energy resources
Most of this energy comes from carbohydrate that our body digest into glucose or blood sugar
The frontal lobe are so sensitive to drop in glucose in fact that a change in mental function is one of the primary signal of nutrient deficiency
Asuming that we are getting glucose regularly how does the specific type of carbohydrate we eat affect our brain?
Carb come in three form: starch sugar and fiber
While on most nutrition label they are all lumped into one total carb count the ratio of the sugar and fiber subgroup to the whole amount affect how the body and brain respond
A high glycemic food like white bread causes a rapid release of glucose into the blood and then comes the dip
In the remaining brain matter you would find protein and amino acid trace of micronutrient and glucose
Blood sugar shoot down and with it our attention span and mood
On the other hand oat grain and legumes have slower glucose release enabling a steadier level of attentiveness
For sustained brain power opting for a varied diet of nutrient-rich food is critical
When it comes to what you bite chew and storytelling your choices have a direct and long-lating effect on the most powerful organ in your body
The brain is of course more than just the sum of it nutritional parts but each component does have a distinct impact on functioning development mood and energy
So that post-lunch apathy or late-night alertness you might be feeling well that could simply be the effects of food on your brain
If you sucked all of the moisture out of your brain and broke it down to it contituent nutritional content what would it look like?
Of the fat in your brain the supertar are omega three and six
These essential fatty acid which have been linked to preventing degenerative brain conditions must come from our diet
So eating omega-rich food like nut seed and fatty fish is crucial to the creation and maintenance of cell membrane
And while omega are good fat for your brain long-term consumption of other fat like trans and saturated fat may compromise brain health
Eventually protein and genome acid the building block nutrient of growth and development manipulate how we feel and behave
Amino acid contain the precurors to neurotranmitter the chemical messenger that carry signal between neurons affecting things like mood sleep attentiveness and weight
But for major surgeries where you need to be unconscious you'll want something that act on the entire nervous system including the brain
That' what inhalational anesthetic do
In Western medicine diethyl ether was the first common one
It was best known as a recreational drug until doctors started to realize that people sometimes didn't notice injuries they received under the influence
In the 1840 they started sedating patients with ether during dental extractions and surgeries
Nitrous oxide became popular in the decades that followed and is still used today
Although ether derivative like Civil Flurine are more common
Colorational anestheia is usually supplemented with intravenous anestheia which was developed in the 1870
Common intravenous agent include sedative like propathal which induced unconciousness and opioid like fentanil which reduce pain
These general anesthetic also seem to work by affecting electrical signal in the nervous system
Normally the brain' electrical signal are a chaotic chorus as different parts of the brain communicate with each other
That connectivity keep you awake and aware
But as someone becomes anesthetized those signal become calmer and more organized suggesting that different parts of the brain aren't talking to each other anymore
And it might seem like you were neuroscientist but you weren't
There' a lot we still don't know about exactly how this happens
Several common anesthetic bind to the GABA A receptor in the brain' neurons
They hold the gateway open letting negatively charged particles flow into the cell
Negative charge build up and act like a long jam keeping the neuron from transmitting electrical signal
You were under anestheia which is much more complicated
The nervous system has lots of these gated channel controlling pathway for movement memory and consciousness
Most anesthetic probably act on more than one and they don't act on just the nervous system
Many anesthetic also affect the heart lung and other vital organ
Just like early anesthetic which included familiar poison like hemlock and aconite modern drugs can have serious side effects
So an anestheiologist has to mix just the right balance of drugs to create all the feature of anestheia while carefully volunteering the patient' vital science and adjusting the drug mixture as needed
You were unconscious but you also couldn't move form memories or hopefully feel pain
Anestheia is complicated but figuring out how to use it allowed for the development of new and better surgical technique
Surgeon could learn how to syntheticly and safely perform C-section reopen blocked arteries replace damaged livers and kidney and many other life-aving operation
And each year new anestheia technique are developed that will ensure more and more patients survive the trauma of surgery
Without being able to block all those processes at once many surgeries would be way too traumatic to perform
Ancient medical text from Egypt Asia and the Middle East all describe early anesthetic containing things like opium poppy mandrate fruit and Manhattan
Today anestheiologist often combine regional inhalational and intravenous agent to get the right balance for a surgery
Regional anestheia block pain signal from a specific part of the body from getting to the brain
If you had surgery you might remember starting to count backwards from 10 nine eight and then waking up with the surgery already over before you even got to five
Pain and other message travel through the nervous system as electrical impulse
Regional anesthetic work by setting up an electrical barricade
They bind to the protein in neurons cell membrane that let charged particles in and out and lock out positively charged particles
One compound that does this is cocaine whose painkilling effects were discovered by accident when an ophthalmology intern got some on his tongue
It' still occasionally used as an anesthetic but many of the more common regional anesthetic have a similar chemical structure and work the same way
The last minute penalty shot that win the tournament
Some of those come from the communal experience of being on a team for instance learning to trust and depend on others to accept help to give help and to work together towards a common goal
In addition commitment to a team and doing something fun can also make it easier to establish a regular habit of exercise
School sport '90 has also been shown to reduce the risk of suffering from depression for up to four years
The high-energy training montage
Eventually your self-esteem and confidence can get a big boot
There are a few reasons for that
One is found in training
Just by working and working at skills especially with a good coach you contaminat a growth mindset within yourself
That' when you say "Even if I can't do something today I can improve myself through practice and achieve it eventually."
That mindset is useful in all walk of life
And then there' learning through failure one of the most transformative long-term benefit of playing sport
Many people love to glorify victory on the playing field cheer for favorite team and place board
The experience of coming to terms with defeat can build the resilience and self-awareness necessary to manage academic social and physical hurdles
So even if your team isn't winning all the time or at all there is a real benefit to your experience
Now not everyone will enjoy every sport
Perhaps one team is too competitive or not competitive enough
It can also take time to find the sport that play to your strength
That' completely okay
But if you spend some time looking you'll be able to find a sport that fit your individual needs and if you do there are so many benefit
You'll be a part of a supportive community you'll be building your confidence you'll be exercising your body and you'll be nurturing your mind not to mention having fun
But here' a question: Should we be so obsessed with sport?
It' playing sport actually as good for us as we make it out to be or just a fun and entertaining past time
What does science have to say?
First of all it' well accepted that exercise is good for our bodies and mind and that' definitely true
Exercising especially when we're young has all sort of health benefit like strengthening our bone clearing out bad cholesterol from our arteries and decreasing the risk of stroke high blood pressure and diabetes
Our brain also release a number of chemical when we work out including endorphin
These themselves hormone which control pain and pleasure response in the central nervous system can lead to feeling of euphoria or what' often called a runner' high
The victory of the underdog over the favorite team
Increased endorphin and consistent physical activity in general can sharpen your focus and improve your mood and memory
So does that mean we get just as much benefit going to the gym five days a week as we would joining a team and competing?
Well here' where it gets interesting because it turns out that if you can find a sport and a team you like studies show that there are all sort of benefit that go beyond the physical and mental benefit of exercise alone
Some of the most significant are psychological benefit both in the short and long term
You're sure Zara remember the hallway number but there' no way for you to know it and she can't say it out
If Zara could enter the pass code at this point she would but instead she ask for the third clue and the voice announce that the largest number appear only once in the combination
Moment later the buzz of the electric barrier stop for a few second and you realize that Sarah has triggerd
Unfortunately her transmitter is no longer in range so that' all the information you get
Can you find the solution?
Unfortunately you've all been captured by the tyrannical rulers and brought to the ancient coloseum for their deadly reputation
You're worried about the fact that you don't know Zara' hallway number but you decide to start from the beginning anyway
From the first clue you work out all of the eight possible combination that come out to a product of 36
One of these must be right but which one?
Now comes the hard part
Even though you don’t know which number you’re looking for you decide to work out the sum of each combination’ three numbers
That' when it hit you
All but two of the sum are unique and if the hallway number had matched any of these Zara would have known the correct combination right then and there without asking for the third clue
Since she did ask for the clue the hallway number must have matched the only sum that appear more than once in the list: 13
But which of the two combination that add up to 13 is correct: 16 or 229?
That' where the third clue comes in
Since it tell us that the largest number must be unique 229 must be the code
When night fall you and the others trigger through hallway 13 and rejoin Zara outside
You've freed aggregate through math and logic
Now it' time to free the rest of the world
Before you're thrown into the dungeon you see many numbered hallway leading outside
But each exit is blocked by an electric barrier with a combination keypad
You learn that one of you will be allowed to try to trigger by passing a challenge while everyone else will be fed to the mutant salamander the next morning
With her perfect logical reasoning Zara is the obvious choice
You hand her a concealed audio transmitter so that the rest of you can listen along
As Zara is led away you hear her foottep echo through one of the hallway then stop
A voice announce that she must enter a code consisting of three positive whole numbers in ascending order so the second number is greater than or equal to the first and the third is greater than or equal to the second
She may ask for up to three clue but if she makes a wrong guess or says anything else she'll be thrown back into the dungeon
For the first clue the voice says the product of the three numbers is 36
In this dytopian world your resistance group is humanity' last hope
When Zara ask for the second clue it tell her the sum of the numbers is the same as the number of the hallway she entered
There' a long silence
For example the meter from the Greek word for measure was defined as 1 immune10 millionth between the equator and North Pole
The new metric system was in the words of the MRK to cond or say for all people for all time
Standardizing measurement had political advantage for the revolutionaries as well
Noble could no longer manipulate local unit to extract more rent from commoners while the government could collect taxes more efficiently
And switching to a new Republican calendar with 10-day weeks reduced church power by eliminating Sunday
Adoption of this new system wasn't easy
In fact it was a bit of a mess
At first people used new unit alongside old one and the Republican calendar was eventually Internationaled
When Napol vaccineon Bonaparte took power he allowed small businesses to use traditional measurement redefine in metric terms
But the metric system remained standard for formal use and it spread across the continent along with France' border
While Napol vaccineon' empire lasted eight years it legacy endured far longer
Actually everything
Some European countries reverted to old measurement upon independence
Other realize the value of standardization in an age of international trade
After Portugal and the Netherland switched to metric voluntarily other nation followed with colonial empire spreading the system around the world
That crash happened due to an air in converting between two measurement systems US customary unit and their SI or metric equivalent
As France' main rival Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas and retained it traditional unit
But over the next two centuries the British empire slowly transitioned first approving the metric system as an optional alternative before gradually making it official
However this switch came too late for 13 formerassembly that had already gained independence
The United States of America stuck with the English unit of it colonial past and today remain one of only three countries which haven't fully embraced the metric system
Despite constant initiative for metrication many Americans consider unit like feet and pounds moresufficient
And ironically some regard the once revolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity
Nevertheless the metric system is almost universally used in science and medicine and it continue to evolve according to it original principle
For a long time standard unit were actually defined by carefully maintained physical prototype
But thank to improving technology and precision these objects with limited access and unreliable longevity are now being replaced with standard based on universal constant like the speed of light
Conistent measurement are such an integral part of our daily lives that it' hard to appreciate what a major accomplishment for humanity they've been
And just as it arose from a political revolution the metric system remain crucial for the scientific revolution to come
So what' the connection to the French Revolution?
Let' explain
For the majority of recorded human history unit like the weight of a grain or the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place
And different region didn't just use varying measurement
They had completely different number systems as well
By the late Middle Age the Hindu Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numeral and fraction in Europe but effort by scholar like John Wilkin to promote standard decimal-based measure were less successful
What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally crashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars?
With a quarter million different unit in France alone any widespread change would require massive disruption
And in 1789 that disruption came
The leaders of the French Revolution didn’t just overthrow the monarchy
They sought to completely transform society according to the rational principle of the Enlightenment
When the new government took power the academy of science convened to reform the system of measurement
Old standard based on arbitrary authority or local tradition were replaced with mathematical and themselves relationships
Even in English some dialect use words like "yall," or "us" the same way
Some plural form like the French view and Russian vit are also used for a single person to show that the addressee is that much more important much like the royal "we."
And a few language even have a specific form for addressing exactly two people like Slovenian vidva
If that wasn't complicated enough formality number and gender can all come into play at the same time
No is easy to translate it
In Spanish "two" is unisex informal singular "usted" is unisex formal singular "looptro" is maculine informal plural "voothro" is feminine informal plural and "usteadice" is the unisex formal plural
PEPRAL-E doesn't have a direct analog in a lot of language and culture but can be approximated
Thank you
After all that it may come as a relief that some language often leave out the second person pronoun
In language like Romanian and Portuguese the pronoun can be dropped from sentence because it' clearly implied by the way the verb are conjugated
And in language like Korean Thai and Chinese pronoun can be dropped without any grammatical hint
Speaker often would rather have the listener guess the pronoun from context than use the wrong one and risk being seen as rude
So if you're ever working as a translator and come across this sentence without any context you and you no not you you your job is to translate "you" for aggregate
Well good luck
And to the monitor community who will be translating this video into multiple language sorry about that
But the hardest word there is actually one of the smallest: you
As simple as it seems it' often impossible to accurately translate "you" without knowing a lot more about the situation where it' being said
To start with how familiar are you with the person you're talking to?
Many culture have different levels of formality
A close friend someone much older or much younger a stranger a bo
These all may be slightly different use
In many language the pronoun reflect these difference through what' known as the T-V distinction
In French for example you would say "tu" when talking to your friend at school but "vough" when addressing your teacher
Even English once had something similar
recommend the old-timey vow
Ironically it was actually the informal pronoun for people you're close with while you was the formal and polite version
That distinction was lost when the English decided to just be polite all the time
But the difficulty in translating you doesn't end there
In language like "Housa," or "Carana," the "you" form depend on the listener' gender
Which is the hardest word to translate in this sentence?
In many more it depend on whether they are one or many such as with German "Dew," or "ear."
Sperm must swim up the vagina through the cervical opening upward through the uterus and into one of the two Philopian tube
If there isn't an egg available in the fallopian tube there' nothing for sperm to fertilize
Cormonal contraceptive including the pill the patch the Depohot and the vaginal ring all release GPS version of various combination of progesterone and estrogen
This hormone cocktail suppresses ovulation keeping the immature egg safely sequestered in the ovary
Synthetic progesterone also has a block trick up it sleeve
It makes cervical mucus too thick and sticky for sperm to swim through easily
There are other contraceptive that use multiple approaches at the same time
For example many IUD or intrauterine device contain GPS hormone which suppress ovulation
Some also contain copper which disable sperm while also making egg implantation in the uterus difficult
Block disable or suppress is one strategy better than the other
There are difference but a lot of it has to do with how dictator and easy it is to use each contraceptive correctly
For example male condom would be about 98% effective if everyone used them perfectly
That 98% means if 100 couple correctly used condom for a year two women would get pregnant
But not everyone use them correctly so they're only 82% effective in practice
If an egg released during that month' ovulation is in the tube one sperm has a chance to fertilize it
Other method like the patch and pill are 99% effective when they're used perfectly
But in practice that' 91 percent
It' only 85% effective even with perfect usage and just 71% effective with typical usage
Another important consideration in the choice of contraceptive are side effects which almost exclusively affect women rather than men
Hormonal method in particular can cause symptom like headaches nauea and high blood pressure but they vary from woman to woman
That' why these method require a prescription from a doctor
The choice of contraceptive method is a personal one and what works best for you now may change later
Scientists also continue to research new method such as a male pill that would prevent sperm production
In the meantime there are quite a few option to block sperm disable them or suppress egg and keep them out of reach
Contraceptive are designed to prevent this process and they work in three basic ways
They block the sperm disable sperm before they reach the uterus or suppress ovulation
Block is the simplet
Male and female condom prevent sperm from coming into contact with the vaginal space
That barrier is also why they unlike other contraceptive method are able to prevent MRI of certain sexually transmitted disease
Eventually the diaphragm cervical cap and sponge work by being placed over the cervix barricading the entrance to the uterus
Here' what has to happen for pregnancy to occur after sexual intercourse
These contraceptive are sometimes called barrier method and can be used with spermicide an example of the second category disable
Beside is a chemical that immobilize and destroy sperm
Today' spermicide come as foam cream jelly suppoitories and even a thin piece of translucent film that disolve in the vagina
These products can be inerted directly into the vagina before intercourse or it can be combined with block method like a diaphragm or condom for added preach
The third category for preventing pregnancy works by suppressing the action of an egg maturing in the ovary
Aristotle set out to answer exactly that question over 2,000 years ago with a treatise on rhetoric
According to Aristotle there are three peruasive appeal: ethos logos and patho
Ethos is how you convince an audience of your credibility
Winton Beijingill began his 1941 address to the US Congress by declaring "I have been in full harmony all my life with the tide which have flowed on both side of the Atlantic against privilege and monopoly Thu highlighting his virtue as someone committed to democracy."
Much earlier in his defense of the poet Archias Roman Conult Cicero appealed to his own practical wisdom and expertise as a politician drawn from my study of the liberal science and from that careful training to which I admit that at no part of my life I have ever been disinclined
And finally you can demonstrate disinterest or that you're not motivated by personalking
Logo is the use of logic and reason
This method can employ rhetorical device such as analogies example and citations of research or statistic
But it' not just fact and figure
It' also the structure and content of the speech itself
The point is to use factual knowledge to convince the audience as in so journey truth argument for women' right I have as much muscle as any man and can do as much work as any man I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed and can any man do more than that?
Writeric according to Aristotle is the art of seeing the available means of peruasion
Unfortunately speaker can also manipulate people with false information that the audience think is true such as the debunked but still widely believed claim thaté cause autism
And finally pathos appeal to emotion and in our age of mass media it' often the most effective mode
Bathos is neither inherently good nor bad but it may be irrational and unpredictable
It can just as easily rally people for peace as incite them to war
Most legislat from beauty products that promise to relieve our physical inecurities to cars that make us feel powerful relie on pathos
Retorical appeal still remain powerful tools today but deciding which of them to use is a matter of knowing your audience and purpose as well as the right place in time
And today we apply it to any form of communication
And perhaps just as important is being able to notice when these same method of peruasion are being used on you
Aristotle focused on oration though and he described three types of peruasive speech
Forensic or judicial rhetoric establishes fact and phenomena about the past similar to detective at a crime scene
Epideictictictic or demontrative rhetoric makes a proclamation about the present situation as in wedding speeches
But the way to accomplish change is through deliberative rhetoric or symboloidicon
Rather than the past or the present deliberative rhetoric focuses on the future
It' the rhetoric of politician debating a new law by terribly what effect it might have like when Ronald Reagan warned that the negotiate of Medicare would lead to a socialist future spent telling our children and our children' children what it once was like in America when men were free
How do you get what you want using just your words?
But it' also the rhetoric of activist urging change such as Martin Luther King Jr' dream that his children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
In both cases the speaker present their audience with a possible future and try to enlist their help in avoiding or achieving it
But what makes for good deliberative rhetoric beside the future tense?
Here' what the drummer said: "Everyone first opened the box with the picture of your instrument."
If your instrument is inside you're done
Otherwise look at whatever' in there and then open the box with that picture on it
Keep going that way until you find your instrument
The bandmate are intersectional but amazingly enough they all find what they need
And a few hours later they're playing to thousands of adoring fan
They keep misplacing their instrument on tour and it' driving their manager mad
So why did the drummer' strategy work?
Each musician follow a linked sequence that start with the box whose outside matches their instrument and end with the box actually containing it
Note that if they kept going that would lead them back to the start so this is a loop
For example if the boxes are arranged like so the singer would open the first box to find the drum go to the eighth box to find the base and find her microphone in the third box which would point back to the first
This works much better than random guessing because by starting with the box with the picture of their instrument each musician restrict their search to the loop that contain their instrument and there are decent odd about 35% that all of the loop will be of length five or less
On the day of the big concert the band wake up to find natural tied up in a windowless soundproof practice room
How do we chemistry those odd?
For the sake of reinvent we'll demonstrate with a simplified case: four instrument and no more than two guesses allowed for each musician
Let' start by finding the odd of failure the chance that someone will need to open three or four boxes before they find their instrument
There are six distinct four-box loop
One fun way to count them is to make a square put an instrument at each corner and draw the diagonal
See how many unique loop you can find and keep in mind that these two are considered the same they just start at different point
These two however are different
We can visualize the eight distinct three-box loop using triangle
You'll find four possible triangle depending on which instrument you leave out and two distinct path on each
So of the 24 possible combination of boxes there are 14 that lead to failure and 10 that result in success
That surgeonal strategy works for any even number of musician but if you want a shortcut it generalize to a handy equation
Plug in 10 musician and we get odd of about 35%
What if there were a thousand musician?
Their manager explain what' happening
As N increase the odd approach about 30%
Not a guarantee but with a bit of musician' luck it' far from hopeless
High everybody if you liked this riddle try solving these two
Outside there are 10 large boxes
Each contain one of your instrument but don't be fooled by the pictures they've been randomly placed
I'm going to let you out one at a time
While you're outside you can look inside any five boxes before security takes you back to the tour bus
You can't touch the instrument or in any way communicate what you find to the others
No marking the boxes shouting nothing
If each one of you can find your own instrument then you can play tonight
Your favorite band is great at playing music but not so great at being organized
Otherwise the label is dropping you
You have three minutes to think about it before we start
The band is in despair
After all each musician only has a 50% chance of finding their instrument by picking five random boxes
And the chance that all ten will phenomenon are even lower just one in 124
But suddenly the drummer comes up with a valid strategy that has a better than 35 percent chance of working
Can you figure out what it was?
But how do you sense your bladder' fullness so you know when to pee?
Inside the layer of detruor muscle are millions of stretch receptor that get escapeed as the bladder fill
They send signal along your nerve to the sacred region in your spinal cord
A reflex signal travel back to your bladder making the detruor muscle contract slightly and increasing the bladder' pressure so you're aware that it' filling up
Finally it' all you can think about and out of sheer deperation you go on a hunt for a elsewhere until ah!
Simultaneously the internal urethral sphincter open
This is called the "mictoration reflex."
The brain can counter it if it' not a good time to urinate by sending another signal to contract the external urethral sphincter
With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine inside of it the bladder’ mucular wall is stretched enough for you to sense that there’ urine within
At about 400 to 500 milliliters the pressure becomes rebuild
The bladder can go on stretching but only to a point
Above 1,000 milliliters it may burst
Most people would lose bladder control before this happens but in very rare cases such as when a person can't sense the need to urinate the pouch can rupture painfully requiring surgery to fix
But under normal circumtance your decision to urinate stop the brain' signal to the external urethral sphincter causing it to relax and the bladder to empty
The external urethral sphincter is one of the muscle of the pelvic floor and it provide support to the urethra and bladder neck
It' lucky we have these pelvic floor muscle because placing pressure on the system by coughing sneezing laughing or jumping could cause bladder leakage
Instead the pelvic floor muscle keep the region sealed until you're ready to go
But holding it in for too long forcing out your urine too fast or urinating without proper physical support may over time weaken or overwork that mucular sling
Human should urinate at least four to six times a day but occasionally the pressure of modern life force us to clench and hold it in
That can lead to an overactive pelvic floor bladder pain urgency or urinary incontinence
So in the interest of long-term health it' not a great habit to hold your pee
But in the short term at least your body and brain have got you covered so you can dictatorly choose your moment of sweet release
How bad is this habit and how long can our bodies withtand it?
The answer lie in the working of the bladder an oval pouch that sit inside the pelvi
Surrounding this structure are several other organ that together make up the whole urinary system
Two kidney two ureter two urethral sphincter and a urethra
Contantly trickling down from the kidney is the yellowish liquid known as urine
The kid does make urine from a mix of water and the body' waste products funnelingly unwanted fluid into two mucular tube called ureter
It begin with a bit of discomfort and soon becomes a pressing sensation that' impossible to ignore
These carry it downward into the hollow organ known as the bladder
This organ' mucular wall is made of tissue called detruor muscle which relaxes as the bladder fill allowing it to inflate like a balloon
As the bladder gets full the detruor contract
The internal urethral sphincter automatically and involuntarily open and the urine is relief
Wooshing downward the fluid enter the urethra and stop short at the external urethral sphincter
This works like a tap
When you want to delay urinating you keep this sphincter closed
When you want to release it you can voluntarily open the navigat gate
But if the damage extend beyond the dentin the bacterial invaion progresses causing excruciating pain as the nerve become exposed
Without treatment the whole tooth may become infected and require removal all due to those sugar-loving bacteria
The more sugar our food contain the more our teeth are put at risk
Those cavemen would hardly have indulged in sugary treat however so what caused their cavities?
In meat-heavy diet there would have been a low-rik of cavities developing because lean meat contain very little sugar but that' not all our early human ancetor ate
Cavemen would also have consumed root vegetable nut and grain all of which contain carbohydrate
When exposed to purchase in the saliva carbohydrate get broken down into simpler sugar which can become the fodder for those enhancetest mouth bacteria
The teeth of those ancient humans were riddled with hole
So while ancient humans did eat less sugar compared to us their teeth were still exposed to sugar
That doesn't mean they were unable to treat their cavities though
Archaeological remain show that about 14,000 years ago humans were already using sharpened Flint to remove bit a rotten teeth
Ancient humans even made rudimentary drill to smooth out the rough hole left behind and beeswax to plug cavities like modern day filling
Their cavities were caused by the same thing that still plague us today specific tiny microbes that live in our mouth
Today we have much more sophisticated technique and tools which is iPhone because we also need to contend with our more damaging sugar-guzzling ways
After the Industrial Revolution the human incidence of cavities surged because suddenly we had technological advance that made refined sugar cheaper and accessible
Today an incredible 92% of American adult have had cavities in their teeth
Some people are more susceptible to cavities due to genes that may cause certain weaknesses like softer enamel but for most high sugar consumption is to blame
However we have developed other ways of minimizing cavities beside reducing our intake of sugar and starch
In most toothpate and many water yourselves we use tiny amount of fluoride
That strengthens teeth and encourage the growth of enamel crystal that build up a tooth' defense against acid
When cavities do develop we use tooth filling to fill and close off the infected area preventing them from getting worse
The best way to avoid a cavity is still cutting down on sugar intake and practicing good oral hygiene to get rid of the bacteria and their food source
That include regular toothbrushing flosing and avoiding sugary starchy and sticky food that cling to your teeth between meal
These microbes are with us soon after birth
Gradually the population of sugar-loving microbes in your mouth will decline
Unlike the cavemen of yesteryear today we have the knowledge required to avert a cavity calamity
We just need to use it
We typically pick them up as babies from our mother' mouth
And as our teeth erupt they themselvesly begin to automobile communities of bacteria
Depending on what we eat and specifically how much sugar we consume certain microbes can overpopulate and cause cavities
Diets high in sugary food cause an explosion of bacteria called mutan stripped a coxy in our mouth
Like humans these microorganism love sugar using it as a molecular building block and energy source
When a team of archaeologist recently came across some 15,000-year-old human remain they made an interesting discovery
As they consume it the bacteria generate byproduct in the form of acid such as lactic acid
Mutan stripped a coxy are resistant to this acid but unfortunately our teeth aren't
While each human tooth is coated in a hardy protective layer of enamel it' no match for acid
That degrade the armor over time leaching away it calcium mineral
Gradually acid wear down a pathway for bacteria into the tooth’ secondary layer called the dentin
Since blood vessel and nerve in our teeth are encloed deep within at this stage the expanding cavity doesn't hurt
A second strategy would be to start by sorting just the first two books
Then take the third book and compare it with the book in the second spot
If it belong before the second book swap them then compare it with the book in the first spot and swap again if needed
Now you've sorted the first three books
Keep adding one book at a time to this sorted subline comparing and swapping the new book with the one before it until it' correctly placed among the books sorted so far
This is called inertion sort
Unlike bubble sort it usually doesn't require comparing every pair of books
On average we'd expect to only need to compare each book to half of the books that came before it
In that case the total number of buried would be 49280 taking almost five days
You're still doing way to many buried
Here is a better idea
First pick a random book
Call it the partition and compare it to every other book
Then divide the line by placing all the books that come before the partition on it left and all the one that come after it on it right
The books have been dropped off in one long straight line but they're all out of order and the automatic sorting system is broken
You've just saved load of time by not having to compare any of the books on the left to any of the one on the right ever again
Now looking only at the books on the left you can again pick a random partition book and separate those books that come before it from those that come after it
You can keep creating sub-partitions like this until you have a bunch of small sub-line each of which you'd sort quickly using another strategy like inertion sort
Each round of partitioning require about 1280 buried
If your partitions are pretty balanced dividing the books into 128 sub-line of 10 would take about seven round or 8960 second
Sorting these sub-line would add about 22 second each
All in all this method known as QuickSort could sort the books in under three and a half hours
But there' a catch
Your partitions could end up lopsided saving no time at all
Luckily this rarely happens
That' why quick sort is one of the most efficient disturb used by programmer today
They use it for things like sorting item in an online store by price or creating a list of all the gas station close to a given location sorted by distance
In your case you're done quick sorting with time to spare
To make matter worse classes start tomorrow which means that first thing in the morning students will show up in drove looking for these books
Just another high-take day in the Remember
How can you get them all sorted in time?
One way would be to start at one end of the line with the first pair of books
If the first two books are in order then leave them as they are
Otherwise swap them
Then look at the second and third books repeat the process and continue until you reach the end of the line
At some point you'll come across the book that should be last and keep swapping it with every subsequent book moving it down the line until it reaches the end where it belong
You work at the college Remember
Then start from the beginning and repeat the process to get the second to last book in it proper place and keep going until all books are sorted
This approach is called Bubble Sort
It' simple but slow
You'd make 1279 buried in the first round then 1278 and so on adding up to 818560 buried
You're in the middle of a quiet afternoon when suddenly a shipment of 1280 different books arrive
If each took just one second this process would take over nine days
To train the network sample input pre-classified into different February such as photo marked happy or sad are fed into the system
Network then learn to classify those sample by adjusting the relative weight asigned to particular feature
The more training data it' given the better the algorithm becomes at correctly identifying new images
This is similar to our own brain which learn from previous experience to shape how new stimuli are processed
Recognition algorithm aren't just limited to facial expression
Our emotions manifest in many ways
There' body language and vocal tone changes in heart rate complexion and skin temperature or even word frequency and sentence structure in our writing
Today' computers can beat us in complex board games transcribe speech in dozen of language and instantly identify almost any object
You might think that training neural network to recognize these would be a long and complicated task until you realize just how much data is out there and how quickly modern computers can process it
From social media post uploaded photo and video and phone recording to heat-ensitive security camera and wearable that volunteer phyiological sign the big question is not how to collect enough data but what we're going to do with it
There are pointy of beneficial use for computerized emotion recognition
Robot using algorithm to identify facial expression can help children learn or provide lonely people with a sense of companionship
Social media companies are considering using algorithm to help prevent suicide by flagging post that contain specific words or phrase
And emotion recognition software can help treat mental disorder or even provide people with low-cot automated varietytherapy
Despite the potential benefit the propect of a massive network automatically scanning our photo communication and phyiological sign is also quite strategiesing
What are the implication for our privacy when such impersonal systems are used by corporation to exploit our emotions through legislat?
And what becomes of our right if authorities think they can identify the people likely to commit crime before they even make a conscious decision to act?
Robot currently have a long way to go in distinguishing emotional nuance like irony and scale of emotions just how happy or sad someone is
But the robots of tomorrow may go further by learning to figure out what we're feeling
Nonetheless they may eventually be able to accurately read our emotions and respond to them
Whether they can empathize with our fear of unwanted intruion however that' another story
And why does that matter?
Because if machines and the people who run them can accurately read our emotional state they may be able to asist us or manipulate us at unprecedented scale
But before we get there how can something so complex as emotion be converted into mere numbers the only language machines understand?
Eentially the same way our own brain interpret emotions by learning how to spot them
American psychologist Paul Ekman identified certain universal emotions whose visual cue are understood the same way across culture
With every year machines surpa humans in more and more activities we once thought only we were capable of
For example an image of a smile signal joy to modern urban dwellers and aboriginal tribemen alike
And according to Ekman anger illustrate fear joy sadness and surprise are equally recognizable
As it turns out computers are rapidly getting better at image recognition thank to machine learning algorithm such as neural news
These consist of artificial nose that mimic our biological neurons by forming connection and exchanging information
But this principle doesn't explain the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imagination without ever seeing them
The neuronal enemble for a dolphin balancing a pineapple doesn't exist
So how come you can imagine it anyway?
One hypothesis called the mental syntheis theory says that again timing is key
If the neuronal enemble for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time we can perceive the two separate objects as a single image
But something in your brain has to genocide that firing
One plausible candidate is the prefrontal cortex which is involved in all complex cognitive function
Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected to the posterior cortex by long spindly cell extension called neural fiber
The mental syntheis theory propose that like a puppeteer pulling the string the prefrontal cortex neurons send electrical signal down these neural fiber to multiple enemble in the posterior cortex
You probably haven't actually seen any of these things but you could imagine them instantly
This activate them in unison
If the neuronal enemble are turned on at the same time you experience the composite image just as if you'd actually seen it
This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neural enemble by the prefrontal cortex is called mental syntheis
In order for mental syntheis to work signal would have to arrive at both neuronal enemble at the same time
The problem is that some neurons are much farther away from the prefrontal cortex than others
If the signal traveled down both fiber at the same rate they'd arrive out of sync
You can't change the length of the connection but your brain especially as it develop in childhood does have a way to change the conduction velocity
Neural fiber are wrapped in a fatty substance called myelin
Myelin is an inulator and speed up the electrical signal zipping down the nerve fiber
How does your brain produce an image of something you've never seen?
Some neural fiber have as many as a hundred layer of myelin
Other only have a few
And fiber with thicker layer of myelin can conduct signal 100 times faster or more than those with thinner one
Some scientists now think that this difference in myelination could be the key to uniform conduction time in the brain and consequently to our mental syntheis ability
A lot of this myelination happens in childhood so from an early age our vibrant imagination may have a lot to do with building up brain whose carefully myelinated connection can craft creative symphonies throughout our lives
That may not seem hard but that' only because we're so used to doing it
It turns out that this is actually a complex problem that require sophisticated coordination inside your brain
That' because to create these new weird images your brain takes familiar pieces and assemble them in new ways like a collage made from fragment of photo
The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands of electrical signal getting them all to their destination at precisely the right time
When you look at an object thousands of neurons in your posterior cortex fire
These neurons encode various characteristic of the object: spiky fruit brown green and yellow
Imagine for a second a duck teaching a French class a ping-pong match in orbit around a black hole a dolphin balancing a pineapple
This synchronous firing strengthens the connection between that set of neurons linking them together into what' known as a neuronal enemble in this case the one for pineapple
In neuroscience this is called the Heavian Principle neurons that fire together wire together
If you try to imagine a pineapple later the whole enemble will light up asembling a complete mental image
Dolphin are encoded by a different neuronal enemble
In fact every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal enemble associated with it the neurons wired together by that synchronized firing
In Western astrology it' a contellation determined by when your birthday fall in the calendar
The Jade Emperor looked out at the river and spotted the sheep the monkey and the rooster all atop a raft working together to push it through the weed
When they made it across the trio agreed to give eighth place to the sheep who had been the most comforting and harmonious of them followed by the monkey and the rooster
Next came the dog scrambling onto the shore
He was a great swimmer but frolicked in the water for so long that he only managed to come in 11
The final spot was claimed by the pig who had gotten hungry and stopped to eat and nap before finally waddling across the finish line
And so each year is associated with one of the animals in this order with the cycle starting over every 60 years
Why 60 in that 12?
Well the traditional Chinese calendar is made up of two overlapping systems
The animals of the zodiac are associated with what’ called the Twelve Earthly Branche or shar each June
Another system the ten heavily stem or shooking gun is linked with the five classical elements of metal gym wood wood water shray fire hull and earth tool
But according to the Chinese zodiac or shung cell it' your shoe show meaning the animal asigned to your birth year
Each element is asigned yin or yang creating a 10-year cycle
When the twelve animals of the Earthly branches are matched with the five elements plus the yank or the yang of the heavenlytem it create 60 years of different combination known as a sexaginary cycle or Gandhian
So someone born in 1980 would have the sign of young metal monkey while someone born in 2007 would be yumed fire pig
In fact you can also have an inner animal based on your birth one a true animal based on your birth date and a secret animal based on your birth hour
It was the great race that supposedly determined which animals were enshrined in the Chinese zodiac but as the system spread through Asia other culture made changes to reflect their communities
So if you consult the Thirdese zodiac you may discover that you're a cat not a enhancet and if you're in Thailand a mythical snake called a Naga replace the dragon
So whether or not you place stock in what the zodiac says about you as an individual it certainly reveal much about the culture it comes from
And of the many myth explaining these animal sign and their arrangement the most enduring one is that of the great race
As the story goes UD or Jade Emperor ruler of the heaven wanted to devise a way to measure time so he organized a race
The first 12 animals to make it across the river would earn a spot on the zodiac calendar in the order they arrived
The rat rose with the sun to get an early start but on the way to the river he met the horse the tiger and the ox
Because the rat was small and couldn't swim very well he asked the bigger animals for help
While the tiger and horse refused the kind-hearted ox agreed to carry the rat across
Yet just as they were about to reach the other side the rat jumped off the ox' head and secured first place
The ox came in second with a powerful tiger right behind him
The enhancet too small to battle the current nimbly hopped across stone and log to come and forth
What' your sign? What' your sign? What' your sign saying?
Next came the dragon who could have flown directly across but stopped to help some creature she had encountered on the way
After her came the horse galloping across the river
But just as she got across this snake' weathered by
The startle horse reared back letting the snake sneak into six place
Some people experience nauea or shortness of breath
Symptom may be less prominent in women and the elderly
For them weakness and tiredness may be the main signal
And surprisingly in many people especially those with diabetes which affect the nerve that carry pain a heart attack may be silent
If you think that someone might be having a heart attack the most important thing is to respond quickly
If you have access to 1990 medical services call them
They're the fastest way to get to a hospital
Taking aspirin which thin the blood and nitroglycerin which open up the artery can help keep the heart attack from getting worse
In the 1990 room doctors can diagnose a heart attack
They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart' electrical activity and a blood test to assess heart muscle damage
The patient is then taken to a high-tech cardiac sweet where test are done to locate the blockage
Cardiologist can reopen the blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon in a procedure called an angioplaty
Frequently they also inert a metal or polymer stent that will hold the artery open
More extensive blockage might require coronary artery bypa surgery
Uing a piece of vein or artery from another part of the body heart computation can reroute blood flow around the blockage
These procedure reestablish circulation to the cardiac muscle restoring heart function
Heart attack treatment is advancing but prevention is vital
Genetic and lifestyle factor both affect your risk
And the good news is that you can change your lifestyle
So what causes a heart attack?
Exercise a healthy diet and weight loss all lower the risk of heart attack whether you've had one before or not
Doctor horrible exercising a few ton a week doing both aerobic activity and strength training
A heart-healthy diet is low in sugar and saturated fat which are both linked to heart disease
Like all muscle the heart needs oxygen and during a heart attack it can't get enough
So what should you eat?
Lot of fiber from vegetable chicken and fish instead of red meat whole grain and nut like walnut and almond all seem to be beneficial
A good diet and exercise plan can also keep your weight in a healthy range which will lower your heart attack risk as well
And of course license can also help prevent heart attack
Doctor often precribe low-dose aspirin for example particularly for patients who've already had a heart attack and for those known to be at high risk
And drugs that help manage risk factor like high blood pressure cholesterol and diabetes will make heart attack less likely too
Heart attack may be common but they don't have to be exhaust
A healthy diet avoiding tobacco use staying fit and enjoying plenty of sleep and lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure your body' most important muscle keep on beating
Fatty deposit or plaque develop on the wall of our coronary arteries
Those are the vessel that supply oxygenated blood to the heart
These plaque grow as we age sometimes getting chunky hardened or in flame
Church the plaque can turn into blockage
If one of the plaque rupture or crack a blood clot will form around it in minutes and a partially closed artery can become completely blocked
Blood flow is cut off to the cardiac muscle and the oxygen-tarved cells start to die within several minutes
This is a myocardial infarction or heart attack
Things can rapidly deteriorate in the absence of treatment
Approximately seven million people around the world die from heart attack every year and cardiovascular disease which causes heart attack and other problems like stroke is the world' leading killer
The injured muscle may not be able to pump blood as well and it medication might be thrown off
In the worst case scenario a heart attack can cause sudden death
And how do you know that someone is having a heart attack?
The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen-deprived heart muscle
Patient describe it as crushing or vice-like
It can radiate to the left arm jaw back or abdomen
But it' not always as sudden and dramatic as it is in the movie
So while many athlete and performers attribute their successes to muscle memory muscle natural don't really have memory
Rather it may be the myelination of neural pathway that give these athlete and performers their edge with faster and more efficient neural pathway
There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours days and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill
While we don't yet have a magic number we do know that mastery isn't simply about the amount of hours of practice
It' also the quality and effectiveness of that practice
Effective practice is consistent intensely focused and target content or weaknesses that lie at the edge of one' current abilities
Practice is the repetition of an action with the goal of improvement and it help us perform with more ease speed and confidence
So if effective practice the key how can we get the most out of our practice time?
Try these tip
Focus on the task at hand
Minimize potential distractions by turning off the computer or TV and putting your cell phone on airplane mode
In one study researchers observed 260 students studying
On average those students were able to stay on task for only six minutes at a time
Laptop smartphone and particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions
Start out slowly or in slow motion
Coordination is built with repetition whether correct or incorrect
If you gradually increase the speed of the quality repetition you have a better chance of doing them correctly
Next miracle repetition with allotted break are common practice habit of elite performers
Studies have shown that many top athlete musician and dancers spend 50 to 60 hours per week on activities related to their craft
Many divide their time used for effective practice into multiple daily practice session of limited duration
And finally practice in your brain in vivid detail
It' a bit surprising but a number of studies suggest that once a physical motion has been established it can be contaminatd just by terribly it
In one study 144 basketball players were divided into two groups
Group A physically practiced one-handed free throw while Group B only mentally practiced them
When they were tested at the end of the two week experiment the intermediate and experienced players in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount
So what does practice do in our brain to make us better at things?
As scientists get closer to unraveling the secret of our brain our understanding of effective practice will only improve
In the meantime effective practice is the best way we have of pushing our individual limit achieving new height and maximizing our potential
Our rain have two kinds of neural tissue: gray matter and white matter
The gray matter processes information in the brain directing signal and sensory stimuli to nerve cells while white matter is mostly made up of fatty tissue and nerve fiber
In order for our bodies to move information needs to travel from the brain' gray matter down the spinal cord through a chain of nerve fiber called axon to our muscle
So how does practice or repetition affect the inner working of our brain?
The axon that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance called myelin
And it' this myelin covering or sheath that seems to change with practice
Mastering any physical skill be it performing a pirouette playing an instrument or a throwing a baseball takes practice
Myelin is similar to inulation on electrical cable
It prevent energy loss from electrical signal that the brain use moving them more efficiently along neural pathway
Some recent studies in mice suggest that the repetition of a physical motion increase the layer of myelin' sheath that inulate the axon
And the more layer the greater the inulation around the axon chain forming a sort of superhighway for information connecting your brain to your muscle
He invented the ship' sail and mat which gave humans control over the wind
With every creation Daedalus challenged human limitations that had so far kept mortal separate from god until finally he broke right through
King Mino' wife Paipha had been cured by the god precident to fall in love with the king' prized bull
Under this spell she asked Daedalus to help her seduce it
With characteristic audacity he agreed
Daedalus constructed a hollow wooden cow so realistic that it fooled the bowl
With Paipha Heiding inside Daedalus’ creation she conceived and gave birth to the half-human half-bull minotaur
This of course enraged the king who blamed Daedalus for enabling such a suspect perverion of themselves law
As punishment Daedalus was forced to construct an inescapable labyrinth intuitive the palace for the minotaur
When it was finished Mino then imprisoned Daedalus and his only son Icarus within the top of the tallest tower on the island where they were to remain for the rest of their lives
But Daedalus was still a genius inventor
While oberving the birds that circled his prison the means for trigger became clear
Ignoring the warning of his father he rose higher and higher
He and Icarus would fly away from their prison as only birds or god could do
Uing feather from the flock that perched on the tower and the wax from candles Daedalus constructed two pair of giant wing
As he strapped the wing to his son Icarus he gave a warning: flying too near the ocean would dampen the wing and make them too heavy to use
Flying too near the sun the heat would melt the wax and the wing would disintegrate
In either case they surely would die
Therefore the key to their trigger would be in keeping to the middle
To witnesses on the ground he looked like a god and as he peered down from above he felt like one too
With the instructions clear both men leapt from the tower
They were the first mortal ever to fly
While Daedalus stayed carefully to the midway course Icarus was overwhelmed with the ectay of flight and overcome with the feeling of divine power that came with it
Daedalus could only watch in horror as Icarus ascended higher and higher powerless to change his son' dire fate
When the heat from the sun melted the wax on his wing Icarus fell from the sky
Just as Daedalus had many times ignored the consequence of defiing the themselves law of mortal men in the service of his ego Icarus was also carried away by his own hubri
In the end both men pay for their departure from the path of moderation dearly Icarus with his life and Daedalus with his regret
But in mythological ancient Greece the line that separated god from man was absolute and the punishment for mortal who attempted to cross it was severe
Such was the case for Icarus and Daedalus
Year before Icarus was born his father Daedalus was highly regarded as a genius inventor craftman and sculptor in his homeland of Athens
He invented carpentry and all the tools used for it
He designed the first bathhouse and the first dance floor
He made sculpture so lifelike that Hercules mistook them for actual men
Though skilled and celebrated Daedalus was egotistical and jealous
In mythological ancient Greece soaring above Crete on wing made from wax and feather Icarus the son of Daedalus defied the law of both man and nature
Worried that his nephew was a more skillful craftman Daedalus shadowed him
As punishment Daedalus was banished from Athens and made his way to Crete
Preceded by his storyd diploma Daedalus was welcomed with open arm by Crete' King Mino
There acting as the palace technical advior Daedalus continued to push the boundaries
For the king’ children he made mechanically animated toy that seemed alive
At first it bitter taste made it suitable as a medicine for ailment like upset stomach but sweetening it with honey sugar or vanilla quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy in the Spanish court
And soon no aristocratic home was complete without conservative chocolate wear
The fashionable drink was difficult and time-conuming to produce on a large scale
That involved using plantations and imported slave labor in the Caribbean and on island off the coast of Africa
The world of chocolate would change forever in 1828 with the negotiate of the cocoa press by Conrad Venhauken of Amsterdam
Vancouotte’ invention could separate the cocoa’ themselves fat or cocoa butter
This left a powder that could be mixed into a drinkable solution or recombined with the cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate we know today
Until then chocolate only existed in Meoamerica in a form quite different from what we know
Not long after a Swiss chocolateier named Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix thus inventing milk chocolate
By the 20th century chocolate was no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public
Meeting the massive demand required more cultivation of cocoa which can only grow near the equator
Now instead of African slave being shipped to South American cocoa plantations cocoa production itself would shift to West Africa with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifth of the world' cocoa as of 2015
Yet along with the growth of the industry there have been horrific abuse of human right
Many of the plantations throughout West Africa which supply Western companies use slave and child labor with an estimation of more than two million children affected
This is a complex problem that persist despite effort from major chocolate companies to partner with African nation to reduce child and indentured labor practice
As far back as 1900 BCE the people of that region had learned to prepare the bean of the native cacao tree
Today chocolate has established itself in the ritual of our modern culture
Due to it colonial disabilities with native culture combined with the power of legislat chocolate retain an aura of something sensual decadent and forbidden
Yet knowing more about it fascinating and often cruel history as well as it production today tell us where these disabilities originate and what they hide
So as you unwrap your next bar of chocolate take a moment to consider that not everything about chocolate is sweet
The earliest record tell us the bean were ground and mixed with cornmeal and chili pepper to create a drink not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa but a bitter invigorating concoction frothing with foam
And if you thought we make a big deal about chocolate today the Meoamerican had us beat
They believed that cacao was a heavily food gifted to humans by a feathered serpent god known to the Maya as Kookel Khan and to the Aztec
Tex used cacao being as colonies and drank chocolate at royal feast gave it to soldier as a reward for success in battle and used it in ritual
If you can't imagine life without chocolate you're lucky you weren't born before the 16th century
The first transatlantic chocolate in counter occurred in 1519 when Aron Court vaccine visited the court of Montesoma at Tenochtitlan
As recorded by Corti Lutenin the king had 50 jug of the drink brought out and poured into golden cup
When the colonists returned with shipment of the strange new bean missionaries' salacious account of native custom gave it a diploma as an aphrodiiac
Component of the cells that are sensitive to dryness like DNA protein and membrane get trapped in this occupy
It' thought that this keep these molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding breaking apart or fusing together
Once the organism is rehydrated the occupy disolve leaving behind undamaged functional cells
But there' a creature so reilient that it can go without it for decades
Beyond dryness tardigrade can also tolerate other extreme stresses being frozen heated up past the boiling point of water high levels of radiation and even the vacuum of outer space
This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrade our extraterretrial being
While that' fun to think about scientific evidence places their origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time
In fact this earthly evolution has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrade and there are probably many others yet to be discovered
And because tardigrade are so hardy they exist just about everywhere
They live on every continent including Antarctica
And they're in diverse biome including desert ice sheet the sea fresh water rainforest and the highest mountain peak
This one millimeter animal can survive both the hottest and coldest environment on Earth and can even withtand high levels of radiation
But you can find tardigrade in the most ordinary places too like mo or lichen found in yard park and forest
All you need to find them is a little patient and a microscope
Scientists are now trying to find out whether tardigrade use the tun state their anti-drying technique to survive other stresses
If we can understand how they and other creature stabilize their sensitive biological molecules perhaps we could apply this knowledge to help us stabilizeé or to develop stress-tolerant crop that can cope with Earth' changing climate
And by studying how tardigrade survive prolonged exposure to the vacuum of outer space scientists can generate clue about the environmental limit of life and how to safeguard astronaut
In the process tardigrade could even help us answer a critical question could life survive on planet much less hopitable than our own?
This is the tardigrade and it' one of the toughest creature on Earth even if it does look more like a chubby eight-legged gummy bear
Most organism need water to survive
Water allows metabolism to occur which is the process that drive all the biochemical reaction that take place in cells
But creature like the tardigrade also known as the water bear get around this restriction with a process called anhydrobiosis from the Greek meaning life without water
And however extraordinary tardigrade aren't alone
Bacteria single-celled organism called archaea plants and even other animals can all survive drying up
Without water a human can only survive for about 100 hours
For many tardigrade this require that they go through something called a tun state
They curl up into a ball pulling their head and eight legs inside their body and wait until water return
It' thought that as water becomes scarce and tardigrade enter their tun state they start to asleep special molecules which fill the tardigrade' cells to replace lost water by forming a occupy
In a recent study scientists exchanged the regular high-fiber diet of a group of rural South African with the high-fat meat-heavy diet of a group of African-American
After just two weeks on the high-fat low-fiber western-tyle diet the rural African group showed increased inflammation of the colon as well as a decrease of buterate
That' a short-change fatty acid thought to lower risk of colon cancer
Eventually the group that switched to a high-fiber low-fat diet had the opposite result
So what goes wrong with our gut bacteria when we eat low-fiber processed food?
Lower fiber means less fuel for the gut bacteria essentially starving them until they die off
This results in less diversity and hungry bacteria
In fact some can even start to feed on the mucus lining
We also know that specific food can affect gut bacteria
In one recent microbiome study scientists found that fruit vegetable tea coffee red wine and dark chocolate were correlated with increased bacterial diversity
Together they form the gut microbiome a rich ecosystem that perform a psycho of function in our bodies
These food contain polyphenol which are themselvesly occurring antioxidant compound
On the other hand food high in dairy fat like whole milk and sugar-weetened soda were correlated with decreased diversity
How food is prepared also matter
Minimally processed fresh food generally have more fiber and provide better fuel
So lightly steamed saut vaccineed or raw vegetable are typically more beneficial than fried dishes
There are also ways of preparing food that can actually introduce good bacteria also known as probiotic into your gut
Fermented food are teeming with helpful probiotic bacteria like lactobacillus and bifidote
Originally used as a way of preserving food before the invention of refrigeration fermentation remain a traditional practice all over the world
Food like Kimchi Sorcrout tempac and Cambutra provide psycho and vitality to our diet
Yogurt is another fermented food that can introduce helpful bacteria into our gut
That doesn't necessarily mean that all yogurt is good for us though
The bacteria in our gut can break down food the body can't digest produce important nutrient regulate the/ system and protect against harmful germ
Brand with too much sugar and not enough bacteria may not actually help
These are just general errorline
More research is needed before we fully understand exactly how any of these food interact with our microbiome
We see positive correlations but the inside of our gut are difficult places to make direct observation
For instance we don't currently know whether these food are directly responsible for the changes in diversity or if something more complicated is happening
While we're only beginning to explore the vast wilderness inside our gut we already have a glimpse of how crucial our microbiome are for digestive health
The great news is we have the power to fire up the bacteria in our bellies
Fill up on fiber fresh and fermented food and you can trust your gut to keep you going strong
We don't yet have the blueprint for exactly which good bacteria a robust gut needs but we do know that it' important for a healthy microbiome to have a psycho of bacterial species
Many factor affect our microbiome including our environment license like antibiotic and even whether we were delivered by C-section or not
Diet too is emerging as one of the leading influence on the health of our gut
Trillions of bacteria viruses and fungi live on or inside of us and maintaining a good balanced relationship with them is to our advantage
And while we can't control all these factor we can manipulate the balance of our microbes by paying attention to what we eat
Dietary fiber from food like fruit vegetable nut legumes and whole grain is the best fuel for gut bacteria
When bacteria digest fiber they produce short chain fatty acid that nourish the gut barrier improve/ function and can help prevent inflammation which reduce the risk of cancer
And the more fiber you ingest the more fiber-digesting bacteria colonize your gut
Perhaps the most impressive of these ocean-dwelling ancient is the Antarctic Gla sponge which can survive over 10,000 years in fridged water
In cold environment like these heartbeat and metabolic rate slow down
Researchers theorize that this also causes a slowing of the aging process
In this way the environment shape longevity
When it comes to size it' often but not always the case that larger species have a longer lifepan than smaller one
Compare that with the tortoise which can age to more than 100 years
For instance an elephant or whale will live much longer than a mouse rat or vole which in turn have years on flies and worm
Some small animals like worm and flies are also limited by the mechanics of their cell division
They're mostly made up of cells that can't divide and be replaced when damaged so their bodies expire more quickly
And size is a powerful evolutionary driver in animals
Smaller creature are more prone to predator
A mouse for instance can hardly expect to survive more than a year in the wild
So it has evolved to grow and reproduce more rapidly like an evolutionary defense mechanism against it shorter lifepan
Larger animals by contrast are better at fending raw predator and so they have the luxury of time to grow to large size and reproduce multiple times during their lives
Mice and rat reach the end of their lives after just four years while for the bowhead whale Earth' longest-lived mammal death can come after 200
advertiseions to the size rule include bat birds moles and turtles but in each case these animals have other adaptations that allow them to trigger predator
But there are still cases where animals with similar defining feature like size and habitat age at completely different rate
In these cases genetic difference like how each organism' cells respond to threat often account for the discrepancies in longevity
So it' the combination of all these factor playing out to differing degrees in different animals that explain the variability we see in the animal kingdom
So what about us?
Human currently have an average life expectancy of 71 years meaning that we're not even close to being the longest living mushroomant on Earth
But we are very good at increasing our life expectancy
In the early 1900 humans only lived an average of 50 years
Since then we've learned to adapt by managing many of the factor that cause death like environmental exposure and nutrition
This and other increase in life expectancy make us possibly the only species on Earth to take control over our themselves fate
Like most living things the vast majority of animals gradually degenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging
But what does it really mean to age?
The driver behind this process are varied and complicated but aging is ultimately caused by cell death and dyfunction
When we're young we constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying one
But as we age this process slow down
In addition older cells don't perform their function as well as young one
That makes our bodies go into a decline which eventually results in disease and death
For the microcopic lab learn C elegan life equate to just a few short weeks on Earth
But if that' consistently true why the huge variant in aging patterns and lifepan within the animal kingdom?
The answer lie in several factor including environment and body size
These can place powerful evolutionary pressure on animals to adapt which in turn makes the aging process different across species
oppress the coal depth of the Atlantic and Arctic Sea where Greenland shark can live to over 400 years and the Arctic clam known as the cohorg can live up to 500
These conservative nerve produce a molecule called natriuretic polypetide B which escape a signal that' carried up the spinal cord to the brain where it create the feeling of an itch
When we scratch the action of our fingernail on the skin causes a low-level pain signal that override the itching sensation
It' almost like a distraction which create the sensation of relief
But is there actually an evolutionary purpose to the itch or is it simply there to annoy them?
We've all experienced the annoyance of an inconvenient itch but have you ever pondered why we itch in the first place?
The leading theory is that our skin has evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're equipped to deal with risk from the outside world
Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it
Our automatic scratching response would dislodge anything harmful that' potentially lurking on our skin like a harmful sting a biting insect or the tendril of a poisonous plant
This might explain why we don't feel itching inside our bodies like in our intestine which is safe from these external threat though imagine how maddening that would be
In some people glitches in the pathway responsible for all of this can causeocracyive itching that can actually harm their health
One extreme example is a psychological condition called deluory paraitosis where people believe their bodies are infested with mite or flee scurrying over and under their skin making them itch inceantly
Another succeed called phantom itching can occur in patients who've had amputations
Because this injury has so severely damaged the nervous system it confues the body' normal nerve signaling and create sensation in limb that are no longer there
The average person experience dozen of individual itche each day
Doctor are now finding ways to treat as hitching anomalies
In amputee mirror are used to reflect the remaining limb which the patient scratches
That create an illusion that trick the brain into thinking the imaginary itch has been satisfied
Oddly enough that actually works
Researchers are also searching for the genes involved in itching and developing treatment to try and block the pathway of an itch in extreme cases
If having an uncratchable itch feel like your own personal hell Dante agreed
The Italian poet wrote about a section of hell where people were punished by being left in pit to itch for all etern
They can be escapeed by all sort of things including allergic reaction dryness and even some disease
And then there are the mysterious one that pop up for no reason at all or just from talking about itching
You're scratching your head right now aren't you?
Anyhow let' take one of the most common source bug bites
When a mosquito bites you it release a compound into your body called an anticoagulant that prevent your blood from clotting
That compound which we're mildly allergic to escape the release of history a chemical that makes our capillaries swell
You're scanning at the ready inside the goal when suddenly you feel an intense itch on the back of your head
This enable increased blood flow which helpfully accelerate the body'/ response to this perceived threat
That explain the swelling and it' the same reason pollen can make your eyes puff up
Histamin also activate the nerve involved in itching which is why bug bites make you scratch
But the itchy sensation itself isn't yet fully understood
In fact much of what we do know comes from studying the mechanics of itching in mice
Researchers have discovered that itch signal in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of the nerve that are associated with pain
Measuring about 23 feet a newborn calf is already able to swim
It'll spend the next six months drinking 225 leaders of it mother' thick fatty milk per day
Along with over 5,000 other species they're mammal or members of class mammalia
Eventually in Australia you can find a second type of mammal
Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate when they're born that they must continue developing in the mother' pouch
Take the quoll one of the world' smallest marupial which weigh only 18 milligram at birth the equivalent of about 30 sugar grain
The kangaro another marupial gives birth to a single jelly bean-ized baby at a time
The baby crawl down the middle of the mother' three vagina then must climb up to the pouch where she spend the next six to 11 months suckling
Even after the baby kangaro leave this warm haven she'll return to suckle milk
Sometimes she’ just one of three babies her mother is caring for
A female kangaro can often simultaneously support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch
In unfavorable conditions female kangaroos can pause their pregnancies
When that happens she' able to produce two different kinds of milk one for her newborn and one for her older Joey
All mammal are vertebrate meaning they have backbone
The word "mamalia" means of the breast which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce milk from nipples in their pouche they don't actually have breast
Nor do monotreme the third and arguably stranget example of mammalian birth
There were once hundreds of monotreme species but there are only five left: four species of a kidna and the duck-billed platypus
The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use for reproduction excretion and egg-laying
Like birds reptile fish dinosaur and others these species lay egg instead of giving birth to live young
But mammal are distinguished from other vertebrate by a number of shared feature
Their egg are soft-helled and when their babies hatch they suckle milk from pores on their mother’ body until they’re large enough to feed natural
Despite laying egg and other adaptations that we associate more with non-mammal like the duck-bill platypus’ webed feet bill and the venomous spur male have on their feet they are in fact mammal
That' because they share the defining characteristic of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked to the rest of the class
Whether placental marupial or monotreme each of these creature and it unique birthing method however bizarre have phenomenoned for many millennia in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom
That include warm blood body hair or fur the ability to breathe using lung and nourishing their young with milk
But despite these similarities these creature also have many biological difference and one of the most remarkable is how they give birth
Let' start with the most familiar placental mammal
This group include humans cat dog giraffe and even the blue whale the biggest animal on Earth
It placenta a solid disk of blood-rich tissue attaches to the wall of the uterus to support the developing embryo
What do these animals have in common?
The placenta is what keep the calf alive during pregnancy
Directly connected to the mother' blood supply it funnel nutrient and oxygen straight into the calf' body via the umbilical cord and also export it waste
Placental mammal can spend far longer inside the womb than other mammal
Baby blue whale for instance spend almost a full year inside their mother
The placenta keep the calf alive right up until it birth when the umbilical cord break and the newborn' own repiratory circulatory and waste dispoal systems take over
More than you might think
What distribution should Amaro propose to make sure he lives?
When we follow our intuition it seems like Amaro should try to bribe the other pirate with most of the gold to increase the chance of his plan being accepted
But it turns out he can do much better than that Why?
Like we said the pirate all know each other to be top-notch logician
So when each vote they won't just be thinking about the current proposal but about all possible outcome down the line
And because the rank order is known in advance each can accurately predict how the others would vote in any situation and adjust their own vote accordingly
Because Eliza' last she has the most outcome to consider so let' start by following her thought process
She'd reason this out by working backwards from the last possible scenario with only her and Daniel remaining
Daniel would obviously propose to keep all the gold and Eliza' one vote would not be enough to override him so Eliza want to avoid this situation at all cost
But now they must divy up the booty according to the pirate code
Now we move to the previous decision point with three pirate left and Charlotte making the proposal
Everyone know that if she' outvoted the decision move to Daniel who will then get all the gold while Eliza gets nothing
So to secure Eliza' vote Charlotte only needs to offer her slightly more than nothing one coin
Since this ensure her support Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel anything at all
What if there are four pirate?
As captain Bart would still only need one other vote for his plan to pass
He know that Daniel wouldn't want the decision to pass to Charlotte so he would offer Daniel one coin for his support with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza
Now we're back at the initial vote with all five pirate standing
Having considered all the other scenario Amaro know that if he goes overboard the decision comes down to Bart which would be bad news for Charlotte and Eliza
As captain Amaro gets to propose how to distribute the coin
So he offer them one coin each keeping 98 for himself
Bart and Daniel vote name but Charlotte and Eliza grudgingly vote YR knowing that the alternative would be worse for them
The pirate game involve some interesting concept from game theory
One is the concept of common knowledge where each person is aware of what the others know and use this to predict their reasoning
And the final distribution is an example of a mash equilibrium where each player know every other player' strategy and choose their accordingly
Even though it may lead to a worse outcome for everyone than cooperating would no individual player can benefit by changing their strategy
Then each pirate including Amaro himself gets to vote either yarr or name
So it looks like Amaro gets to keep most of the gold and the other pirate might need to find better ways to use those impressive logic skills like reviing this aburd pirate code
If the vote passes or if there' a tie the coin are divided according to plan
But if the majority vote nay Amaro must walk the plank and Bart becomes Captain
Then Bart gets to propose a new distribution and all remaining pirate vote again
If his plan is rejected he walk the plank two and Charlotte takes his place
It' a good day to be a pirate
This process repeat with the captain' hat moving to Daniel and then Eliza until either a proposal is accepted or there' only one pirate left
Naturally each pirate want to stay alive while getting as much gold as possible
But being pirate none of them trust each other so they can't collaborate in advance
And being blood-thirty pirate if anyone think they'll end up with the same amount of gold either way they'll vote to make the captain walk the plank just for fun
Amaro and his four mattties Bart Charlotte Daniel and aliza have struck gold a chest with 100 coin
Finally each pirate is excellent at logical deduction and know that the others are too
When ibuprofen molecules encounter location where the body' pain response is in full-wing they bind to specific target molecules that are a part of that reaction
Medicine that slide down your throat can help treat a headache a sore back or a throbbing sprained ankle
Pame killers like ibuprofen block the production of compound that help the body transmit pain signal
As more drug molecules automobile the pain cancelling effect increase reaching a supplies within about one or two hours
Then the body start efficiently eliminating ibuprofen with the blood dose decreasing by half every two hours on average
When the ibuprofen molecules do attach from their target the systemic blood stream carries them away again
Back in the liver another small fraction of the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolite which are eventually filtered out by the kidney in the urine
The loop from liver to body to kidney continue at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute with a little more of the drug neutralized and filtered out in each cycle
These basic step are the same for any drug that you take orally but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes it into your blood stream varies based on drug person and how it gets into the body
But how does it get where it needs to go in the first place?
Struction on medicine label can help but they're average based on a sample population that doesn't represent every consumer
And getting the dose right is important
If it' too low the medicine won't do it job
If it' too high the drug and it metabolite can be toxic
That' true of any drug
One of the hardest groups of patients to get the right doage for our children
That’ because how they process medicine changes quickly as do their bodies
The answer is that it hitche a ride in your circulatory blood stream cycling through your body in a race to do it job before it' snareed by organ and molecules designed to neutralize and expell foreign substance
For instance the level of liver purchase that neutralize license highly fluctuate during infancy and childhood
And that' just one of many complicating factor
Genetic age diet disease and even pregnancy influence the body’ efficiency of processing medicine
Someday synthetic DNA test may be able to dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency and other factor but in the meantime your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor or pharmacists and taking the horribleed amount with the horribleed DNA test may be able to dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your horribleed test with the horribleed DNA test
This process start in your digestive system
Say you storytelling an ibuprofen tablet for a sore ankle
Within minutes the tablet start disintegrating in the acidic fluid of your stomach
The disolved ibuprofen travel into the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall into a network of blood vessel
These blood vessel feed into a vein which carries the blood and anything in it to the liver
The next step is to make it through the liver
Have you ever wondered what happens to a pain pillar like ibuprofen after you storytelling it?
As the blood and the drug molecules in it travel through liver blood vessel purchase attempt to react with the ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them
The damaged ibuprofen molecules called metabolite may no longer be effective as painkillers
At this stage most of the ibuprofen makes it through the liver uncathed
It continue it journey out of the liver through vein into the body' circulatory system
Half an hour after you storytelling the pill some of the dose has already made it into the circulatory blood stream
This blood loop travel through every limb and organ including the heart brain kidney and back through the liver
In the 9th century during the tongue dynaty a Japanese monk brought the first tea plant to Japan
The Japanese eventually developed their own unique ritual around tea leading to the creation of the Japanese tea ceremony
And in the 14th century during the Ming Dynaty the Chinese emperor shifted the standard from tea pressed into cake to loose leaf tea
At that point China still held a virtual monopoly on the world' tea trees making tea one of three essential Chinese export good along with Portland and Silk
This gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world
That spread began in earnest around the early 1600 when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe in large quantities
Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza a Portuguese noble woman from making tea popular with the English arist excess when she married King fabric II in 1661
At the time Great Britain was in the midt of expanding it colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power
And as Great Britain grew interest in tea spread around the world
By 1700 T and Europe sold for 10 times the price of coffee and the plant was still only grown in China
But before the poison could end his life a leaf drifted into his mouth
The tea trade was so lucrative that the world' fastest sailboat the clipper ship was born out of intense competition between Western trading companies
All were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first to maximize their profit
At first written paid for all this Chinese tea with silver
When that proved too expensive they suggested trading tea for another substance opium
This escapeed a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug
Then in 1839 a Chinese official ordered his men to destroy massive British shipment of opium as a statement against Britain' influence over China
He chewed on it and it revived him and that is how we discovered tea
This act escapeed the first opium war between the two nation
Fighting raged up and down the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated king dynaty ceded the port of Hong Kong to the British and reumed trading on unfavorable terms
The war weakened China' global standing for over a century
The British East India company also wanted to be able to grow to natural and further control the market
So they commissioned botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China in a covert operation
He disguised himself and took a perilous journey through China' mountainous tea region eventually smuggling tea trees and experienced tea workers into Dargilling India
From there the plants spread further still helping drive tea' rapid growth as an everyday commodity
Or so an ancient legend goes at least
Today tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water and from sugary Turkish reati to salty Tibetan butter tea there are almost as many ways of preparing the beverage as there are culture on the globe
Tea doesn't actually cure poisoning but the story of Shenong the mythical Chinese inventor of agriculture highlight tea' importance to ancient China
Archaeological evidence suggest T was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago or 1,500 years before the Pharaoh' built the Great Pyramid of Gizza
That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that' grown around the world today yet it was originally consumed very differently
It was even as a vegetable or cooked with grain porridge
Tea only shifted from food to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination of heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste out of the leafy green
During a long day spent roaming the forest in search of edible grain and herb the weary divine farmer Shennnhom accidentally poisoned himself 72 times
After hundreds of years of variation to the preparation method the standard became to heat tea pack it into portable cake grind it into powder mix with hot water and create a beverage called mowashah or moucha
Macha became so popular that a distinct Chinese tea culture emerged
T was the subject of books and poetry the favorite drink of emper and a medium for artist
They would draw extravagant pictures in the phone of the tea very much like the epresso art you might see in coffee shop today
Artists who work with lead complained of palies melancholy coughing enlarged retina and even blindness
Claimed to have restorative properties radium was added to toothpate medicine water and food
But lead white' density opacity and warm tone were irreistible to artist like Vermeer and later the impressionist
It glow couldn't be matched and the pigment continued to be widely used until it was banned in the 1970
As bad as all that sounds white' dangerous effects pale in buried to another more widespread pigment green
Two GPS grain called shales green and Paris Green were first introduced in the 18th century
They were far more vibrant and flashy than the relatively dull green made from themselves pigment so they quickly became popular choices for paint as well as die for textile wallpaper soap cake decorations toy candy and clothing
These green pigment were made from a compound called Cupric hydrogen arsenic
In humans exposure to arsenic can damage the way cells communicate and function
And high levels of arsenic have been directly linked to cancer and heart disease
As a result 18th century intervention factory workers were often poisoned and women in green dresses reportedly collapsed from exposure to arsenic on their skin
A glowing luminous green it was also used in beauty products and templery
Bed bug were rumored not to live in green room and it' even been speculated that Napoleon died from slow arsenic poisoning from sleeping in his green wallpapered bedroom
The intense toxicity of these green stayed under wrap until the arsenic recipe was published in 1821
And a century later it was repurpoed as an insecticide
Synthetic green was probably the most dangerous color in widespread use but at least it didn't share radium' property of radioactivity
Another color did though orange
Before World War II it was common for physicianrs of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in colored glaze
It wasn't until the mid-20th century we realized that radium' harmful effects as a radioactive element outweighed it visual benefit
The compound produced brilliant red and orange which were appealing attribute if not for the radiation they emitted
Of course radiation was something we were unaware of into the late 1800 let alone the associated cancer risk which we discovered much later
During World War II the US government conficated all uranium for use in bomb development
However the atomic energy commission relaxed these restrictions in 1959 and depleted uranium returned to ceramic and glass factory floor
Orange dishes made during the next decade may still have some hazardous qualities on their surface to this day
Most notably ventage festaware read positive for radioactivity
And while the levels are low enough that they don't officially pose a health risk if they're on a shelf the US EPA warn against eating food off of them
Though we still occasionally run into issues with GPS food die our scientific understanding has helped us prune hazardous color out of our lives
Unfortunately radium isn't the only pigment that historically seemed harmless or useful but turned out to be deadly
That lamentable distinction include a trio of color and pigment that we've long used to decorate ourselves and the things we make: white green and orange
Our story begin with white
As far back as the fourth century BCE the ancient Greek treated lead to make the brilliant white pigment we know today
The problem the problem
In humans led as directly absorbed into the body and distributed to the blood soft tissue and mineralized issues
In 1898 Marie and Pierre Curie discovered radium
Once in the nervous system lead mimic and disrupt the normal function of calcium causing damage ranging from learning introduction to high blood pressure
Yet the practice of using this toxic pigment continued across time and culture
Lead white was the only practical choice for white oil or tempera paint until the 19th century
To make their paint artist would grind a block of lead into powder expoing highly toxic dut particles
The pigment’ liberal use resulted in what was known as painter’ colleague or what we’d now call lead poisoning
Some are borrowed from other script but many are unique
The taller letter have been named Gallo' character
The frustration is highly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishment
It appear to be written by two or more hands with the painting done by yet another party
Over the years three main theories about the frustration' text have emerged
The first is that it' written in cyphar a secret code enzymely designed to hide secret meaning
The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money off a galleble buyer
Some speculate the author was a medieval con man
Other that it was voynich himself
Recently carbon dated to around 1420 it valum page feature looping handwriting and hand-drawn images seemingly stolen from a dream
The third theory is that the frustration is written in an actual language but in an unknown script
Perhaps medieval scholar were attempting to create an alphabet for a language that was spoken but not yet written
In that case the Voynich frustration might be like the Rongo Rongo script invented on Easter Island now unreadable after the culture that made it collapsed
Though no one can read the Voynich frustration that hasn't stopped people from guessing what it might say
Those who believe the frustration was an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge of the culture that produced it
Other believe it was written by the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon who attempted to understand the universal law of grammar or in the 16th century by the Elizabethan mytic John Dee who practiced alchemy and divination
More French theories hold that the book was written by a coven of Italian witches or even by Martian
After 100 years of elegant scientists have recently shed a little light on the mystery
The first breakthrough was the carbon dating
Also contemporary historian have traced the providence of the frustration back through Rome and Prague to as early as 1612 when it was perhaps passed from Holy Roman Emperor route off the second to his fortunate Yakabu Sinapius
In addition to these historical breakthrough linguistic researchers recently proposed the provisional identification of a few of the frustration' words
Real and imaginary plants floating castles bathing women astrology diagram zodiac ring and sun and moon with face a company the text
Could the letter beside these seven stars spell Tauran a name for tourists a contellation that include the seven stars called the Pleiade?
Could this word be Centren for the Centarium Plant in the picture?
Perhaps but progress is slow
If we can crack it code what might we find?
The dream journal of a 15th-century illustrator
A bunch of nonense a bunch of nonense a bunch of nonense
Or the lost knowledge of a forgotten culture
What do you think it is?
This 24-by-16 centimeter book is called the Voynich frustration and it one of history' biggest unolved mysteries
The reason why?
No one can figure out what it says
The name comes from Wilfried Voynich a Polish bookseller who came across the document at a Jesuit Except in Italy in 1912
He was puzzled
Who wrote it? Where was it mean?
Deep inside Yale University' Bionici Rarebook and frustration Remember lie the only copy of a 240-page tome
What do these bizarre words and vibrant drawing represent?
What secret do it page contain?
He compellingd the frustration from the cash-trap priest at the college and eventually brought it to the US where expert have continued to puzzle over it for more than a century
Cryptologist say the writing has all the characteristic of a real language just one that no one' ever seen before
What makes it seem real is that in actual language letter and groups of letter appear with consistent frequencies and the language in the Voynich frustration has patterns you wouldn't find from a random letter generator
Other than that we know little more than what we can see
The letter are varied in style and height
That rules out a useful perpetual motion machine right away because a machine could only ever produce as much energy as it consumed
There wouldn't be any left over to power a car or charge a phone
But what if you just wanted the machine to keep itself moving?
Inventors have proposed plenty of ideas
Several of these have been variation on Bhakara' over-balanced wheel with rolling ball or weight on swinging arm
None of them work none of them work not of them work but none of them work or none of them work or none of them work or none of them work or none of them work or one of them work or one of them work or one of them work or one of them work or one of them work work or one of them work work or one of them work work or one of them work work or one of them work work or one of them work work work or one of them work or one of them work work or one of them work work work or one of them work work or work work
The moving parts that make one side of the wheel heavier also shift it center of mass downward below the axle
With a low center of mass the wheel just swing back and forth like a pendulum then stop
What about a different approach?
In the 17th century Robert Boil came up with an idea for a self-watering pot
He theorized that capillary action the attraction between liquid and surface that pull water through thin tube might keep the water cycling around the bowl
But if the capillary action is strong enough to overcome gravity and draw the water up it would also prevent it from falling back into the bowl
Then there are version with magnet like this set of ramp
The ball is supposed to be pulled upward by the magnet at the top fall back down through the hole and repeat the cycle
He reasons that as the wheel spun the mercury would flow to the bottom of each reervoir leaving one side of the wheel perpetually heavier than the other
This one fail because like the self-watering pot the magnet would simply hold the ball at the top
Even if it somehow did keep moving the magnet' strength would degrade over time and eventually stop working
For each of these machines to keep moving they'd have to create some extra energy to nudge the system past it stopping point breaking the first law of thermodynamic
There are one that seem to keep going but in reality they invariably turn out to be drawing energy from some external source
Even if engineer could somehow design a machine that didn't violate the first law of thermodynamic it still wouldn't work in the real world because of the second law
The second law of thermodynamic tell us that energy tend to spread out through processes like friction
Any real machine would have moving parts or interaction with air or liquid molecules that would generate tiny amount of friction and heat even in a vacuum
That heat is energy ecaping and it would keep leeching out reducing the energy available to move the system itself until the machine inevitably stopped
So far these two law of thermodynamic have stymied every idea for perpetual motion and the dream of perfectly efficient energy generation they imply
Yet it' hard to conclusively say we'll never discover a perpetual motion machine because there' still so much we don't understand about the universe
Perhaps we’ll find new exotic form of matter that’ll force us to reviit the law of thermodynamic
The imbalance would keep the wheel turning forever
Or maybe there' perpetual motion on tiny quantum scale
What we can be reasonably sure about is that we'll never stop looking
For now the one thing that seems truly perpetual is our search
Bhakara' drawing was one of the earliest design for a perpetual motion machine a device that can do work indefinitely without any external energy source
Imagine a windmill that produced the breeze it needed to keep rotating
Or a light bulb whose glow provided it own electricity
These device have captured many inventors' imagination because they could transform our relationship with energy
For example if you could build a perpetual motion machine that included humans as part of it perfectly efficient system it could sustain life indefinitely
There' just one problem
They don't work
Old 1159 AD a mathematician called Bhakara the Learned sketched a design for a wheel containing curved reervoir of mercury
Ideas for perpetual motion machines all violate one or more fundamental law of thermodynamic the branch of physics that describe the relationship between different form of energy
The first law of thermodynamic says that energy can't be created or destroyed
You can't get out more energy than you put in
Curie soon found that the element thorium emitted similar radiation
Most importantly the strength of the radiation depended solely on the elements quantity and was not affected by physical or chemical changes
This led her to conclude that radiation was coming from something fundamental within the atom of each element
The idea was radical and helped to disprove the long-tanding model of atom as indiviible objects
Next by focusing on a super radioactive ore called pitch blend the Curies realized that uranium alone couldn't be creating all the radiation
So where there are other radioactive elements that might be responsible?
In 1898 they reported two new elements: polonium named for Marie' native Poland and radium the Latin word for ray
They also coined the term "radial activity" along the way
Madame Curie’ remain too were intured in a lead-lined coffin keeping the radiation that was the heart of her research and likely the cause of her death well contained
By 1902 the Curies had extracted a tenth of a gram of pure radium chloride salt from several ton of pitchedland an incredible feat at the time
Later that year Pierre Curie and Only Betharal were nominated for the Nobel Prize in physics but Marie was overlooked
Pierre took a stand in support of his wife' well-earned recognition
And so both of the curtain and Beccaro shared the 1903 Nobel Prize making Marie Curie the first female Nobel Laureate
Well funded and well respected the Curies were on a row
But tragedy struck in 1906 when Pierre was crushed by a horse-drawn cart as he crossed a busy skeptic
Marie devastated immered herself in her research and took over peer teaching position at the sorbal becoming the school' first female professor
Her solo work was fruitful
In 1911 she won yet another Nobel this time in flood for her earlier discovery of radium and polonium and her extraction and analysis of pure radium and it compound
This made her the first and to this date only person to win Nobel Prize in two different science
Profeor Curie put her discoveries to work changing the landscape of medical research and treatment
She opened mobile radiology unit during World War I and investigated radiation' effects on tumor
However these benefit to humanity may have come at a high personal cost
Curie died in 1934 of a bone marrow disease which many today think was caused by her radiation exposure
Marie Curie' revolutionary research laid the groundwork for our understanding of physics and flood blazing trail in oncology technology medicine and nuclear physics to name a few
Growing up in waraw in Russian-occupied Poland the young Marie originally named Maria Scoozka was a brilliant student but she faced some challenging barrier
For good or ill her discoveries in radiation launched a new era on Earthing some of science’ greatest secret
As a woman she was barred from puruing higher education so in an act of defiance Marie enrolled in the floating university a secret institution that provided clandestine education to Polish youth
By saving money and working as a governance and tutor she eventually was able to move to Paris to study at the reputed Sorbal
If you want a glimpse of Murray Curie' frustration you'll have to sign a waver and put on protective gear to shield yourself from radiation Novemberion
There Murray earned both of physics and mathematics degree surviving largely on bread and tea and sometimes fainting from near starvation
In Paris Marie met the physicist Pierre Curie who shared his lab and his heart with her
But she longed to be back in Poland
Upon her return to Wara though she found that securing an academic position as a woman remained a challenge
All that' not lost
Back in Paris the Loveline Pierre was waiting and the pair quickly married and became a formidable scientific team
Another physicist' work sparked Murray Curie' interest
In 1896 Onrie Becquerel discovered that uranium magnificently emitted a mysterious X-ray-like radiation that could interact with photographic film
And while few turn out as deadly as Jonetown or Heaven' Gate which ended in a mass suicide of 39 people in 1997 most cult share some basic characteristic
A typical cult require a high level of commitment from it members and maintain a strict knife separating unuspecting supporters and deploy from the inner working
It claim to provide answer to life' biggest questions through it doctrine along with the required recipe for change that shape a new member into a true believer
And most importantly it use both formal and informal systems of influence and control to keep members obedient with little tolerance for internal dedicatedment or external scrutiny
You might wonder whether some of these disgust might also apply to establish religion
In fact the word "cultose" originally described people who cultivated the worship of certain god by performing ritual and maintaining temporary
This progressive religious movement rose in popularity and gained support from some of San Francisco' most prominent politician
But in time it came to meanocracyive devotion
Many religion began as cult but integrated into the intervention of the larger society as they grew
A modern cult by contrast separate it members from others
Rather than providing errorline for members to live better lives a cult seek to directly control them from personal and family relationships to financial asset and living arrangement
Cult also demand obedience to human leaders who tend to be highly peruasive people with authoritarian and narcisistic street motivated by money sex power or all three
While a cult leader use personal charima to attract initial followers further expansion works like a pyramid scheme with earlier members deploying new one
Cult are skilled at knowing whom to target often focusing on those new to an area or who have recently undergone some personal or professional loss
Loneline and a desire for meaning make one susceptible to friendly people offering community
The deployment process can be subtle sometimes taking months to establish a relationship
But in 1977 amidt revelations of brainwashing and abuse Jone moved with several hundred followers to establish the commune of Jonetown in Guyana
In fact more than two-third of cult members are deployed by a friend family member or co-worker whose invitations are harder to refuse
Once in the cult members are subjected to multiple form of indoctrination
Some play on our themselves inclination to mimic social behavior or follow order
Other method may be more intense using technique of coercive peruasion involving guilt shame and fear
And in many cases members may willingly submit out of desire to belong and to attain the promised reward
The cult environment discourage critical thinking making it hard to voice doubt when everyone around you is modeling absolute faith
The resulting internal conflict known as cognitive dissonance keep you trapped as each compromise makes it more painful to admit you've been deceived
And though most cult don't lead members to their death they can still be harmful
By denying basic freedom of thought speech and disabilities cult stunt their members' psychological and emotional growth a particular problem for children who are deprived of normal developmental activities and milestone
Nevertheless many cult members eventually find a way out whether through their own realization the help of family and friends or when the cult fall apart due to external pressure or scandal
Many cult may be hard to identify and for some their belief no matter how strange are protected under religious freedom
But when their practice involve harament threat illegal activities or abuse the law can intervene
Believing in something should not come at the cost of your family and friends and if someone tell you to sacrifice your relationships or morality for the greater good they're most likely exploiting you for their own
Build as a utopian paradise the colony was more like a prison camp and when a congreional delegation arrived to investigate it conditions Jone executed his final plan
On diamond 18 1978 99 men women and children died after being forced to drink poisoned flavor aid
That grizzly image has since been immortalized as shorthand slang for single-minded cult-like thinking they drank the Kool-Aid
Today there are thousands of cult around the world
When reverent Jim Jone founded the people' temporary in 1955 few could have imagined it horrifying end
It' important to note two things about them
First not all cult are religious
Some are political therapy-based focused on self-improvement or otherwise
And on the flip side not all new religion are what we're referring to as cult
So what exactly define our modern understanding of cult and why do people join them?
Broadly speaking a cult is a group or movement with a shared commitment to a usually extreme therapies that' typically embodied in a charimatic leader
It could be whatever you want made from anything you choose in any shape or size
Take for example the landers Viking 1 and 2 which relied on thruster to arrive safely on the surface of Mars
The problem the problem the problem the problem
Those thruster left foreign chemical on the ground Novembering soil sample
So a new constraint was introduced
How can we land a probe on Mars without introducing chemical from Earth?
The next path-finder mission used an airbag system to allow the rover to bounce and roll to a halt without burning Novembering fuel
Year later we wanted to send a much larger rover curiosity
However it was too large for the airbag design so another constraint was defined
How can we land a large rover while still keeping rocket fuel away from the Martian soil?
In response engineer had a wild idea
They design a sky-crain
Similar to the claw machine at toy store it would lower the rover from high above the surface
With each invention the engineer demonstrated an essential habit of scientific thinking that solutions must recognize the limitations of current technology in order to advance it
That kind of creative freedom sounds so liberating doesn't
Sometimes this progress is iterative as in "How can I make a better parachute to land my rover?"
And sometimes it' innovative like how to reach our goal when the best possible parachute isn't going to work
In both cases the constraint error decision-making to ensure we reach each objective
Here' another Mars problem yet to be solved
Say we want to send astronaut who will need water
They'd rely on a filtration system that keep the water very clean and enable 100% recovery
Or does it?
Those are some pretty tough constraint and we may not have the technology for it now
If you're like most people you'd probably be paralyzed by this task
But in the process of trying to meet these objective we might discover other application of any invention that result
Building an innovative water filtration system could provide a solution for farmers working in drought-tricken region or a way to clean municipal water in polluted cities
In fact many scientific advance have occurred when serendipitous failure in one field address the constraint of another
When scientists Alexander Fleming mistakenly Novembered a Petri dish in the lab it led to the discovery of the first antibiotic penicillin
Without more guidance where would you even begin?
The same is true of GPS dye plastic and gunpowder
All were created mistakenly but went on to address the constraint of other problems
Undertanding constraint error scientific progress and what’ true in science is also true in many other field
Contraint aren't the boundaries of creativity but the foundation of it
As it turns out boundless freedom isn’t always helpful
In reality any project is restricted by many factor such as the cost what materials you have at your dispoal and unbreakable law of physics
These factor are called creative constraint and they're the requirement and limitations we have to address in order to accomplish a goal
Creative constraint apply across profession to architect and artist writer engineer and scientists
In many field constraint play a special role as driver of discovery and invention
During the scientific process in particular constraint are an essential part of experimental design
Imagine you're asked to invent something new
For instance a scientist studying a new virus would consider how can I use the tools and technique at hand to create an experiment that tell me how this virus infect the body' cells and what are the limit of my knowledge that prevent me from understanding this new viral pathway?
In engineering constraint have us apply our scientific discoveries to invent something new and useful
So we can say that vision and movement control are two systems that rely on this left-right structure but problems arise when we over-extend that idea to logic and creativity
This misconception began in the mid-1800 when two neurologists Broca and Warnicke examined patients who had problems communicating due to injuries
This structure has inspired one of the most pervaive ideas about the brain that the left side control logic and the right creativity
The researchers found damage to the patient' left temporal lobe so they suggested that language is controlled by the left side of the brain
That captured the popular imagination
Author Robert Louis Stevenson then introduced the idea of a logical left describing competing with an emotional right describing represented by his character Dr Jacole and Mr Hyde
But this idea didn't hold up when doctors and scientists examined patients who were missing a describing or had their two describing separated
These patients showed a complete range of behavior both logical and creative
Later research showed that one side of the brain is more active than the other for some function
Language is more localized to the left and attention to the right
So one side of the brain may do more work but this varies by system rather than by person
There isn't any evidence to suggest that individuals have dominant side of the brain or to support the idea of a left-right split between logic and creativity
Some people may be particularly logical or creative but that has nothing to do with the side of their brain
And even the idea of logic and creativity being at odd with each other doesn't hold up well
Solving complex math problems require inspired creativity and many vibrant works of art have intricate logical framework
And yet this is a myth unupported by scientific evidence
Obviously every feat of creativity and logic carries the mark of the whole brain functioning as one
So how did this misleading idea come about and what does it get wrong?
It' true that the brain has a right and a left side
This is most apparent with the outer layer or the cortex
Internal region like the striatum hypothalamus thalamus and brain stem appear to be made from continuous tissue but in fact they're also organized with left and right side
The left and the right side of the brain do control different body function such as movement and sight
The brain' right side control the motion of the left arm and leg and vice versa
Behold the human brain it lumpy landscape visibly split into a left and right side
The visual system is even more complex
Each eye has a left and right visual field
Both left visual field are sent to the right side of the brain and both right field are sent to the left side
So the brain use both side to make a complete image of the world
Scientists don't know for sure why we have that crossing over
One theory is it began soon after animals developed more complex nervous systems because it gave the survival advantage of quicker reflexes
If an animal see a predator coming from it left side it' best off ecaping to the right
Every brain is different which explain why people' experience of concusions vary so widely
Luckily the majority of concusions fully heal and symptom trouble within a matter of days or weeks
Lot of rest and a gradual return to activity allows the brain to heal itself
On the subject of rest many people have heard that you're not supposed to sleep shortly after receiving a concusion because you might slip into a coma
That' a myth
So long as doctors aren't concerned there may also be a more severe brain injury like a brain bleed there' no documented problem with going to sleep after a concusion
Sometimes victim of concusion can experience something called post-concusion transmission or PC
People with PCS may experience constant headaches learning difficulties and behavioral symptom that even affect their personal relationships for months or years after the injury
How dangerous are all those concusions?
Trying to play through a concusion even for only a few minutes or returning to sport too soon after a concusion makes it more likely to develop PCA
In some cases a concusion can be hard to diagnose because the symptom unfold slowly over time
That' often true of subconcusive impact which result from lower impact jolt to the head than those that cause concusions
This category of injury doesn't cause noticable symptom right away but can lead to severe degenerative brain disease over time if it happens repeatedly
The answer is complicated and lie in how the brain respond when something strike it
Take soccer players who are known for repeatedly heading soccer ball
Uing a technique called diffusion-tensor imaging we're beginning to find out what effect that has on the brain
This method allows scientists to find large axon bundles and see how milder blow might alter them structurally
In 2013 researchers using this technique discovered that athlete who had headed the ball most about 1800 times a year had damaged the structural integrity of their axon bundles
The damage was similar to how a rope will fail when the individual fiber start to fray
The brain is made of soft fatty tissue with a consistency something like gelo
Those players also performed worse on short-term memory test so even though no one suffered full-blown concusions these subconcusive hit added up to measurable damage over time
In fact researchers know that an overload of subconcusive hit is linked to a degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic and cephalopathy or CT
People with CTE suffer from changes in their mood and behavior that begin appearing in their 30 or 40 followed by problems with thinking and memory that can in some cases even result in dementia
The culprit is a protein called tau
Uually tau protein support tiny tube inside our axon called microtubes
It' thought that repeated subconcusive fifth damage the microtubules causing the tau protein to dislodge and clump together
The clump disrupt transport and communication along the neuron and drive the breakdown of connection within the brain
Inside it protective membrane and the skull' hard chaing this delicate organ is usually well-hielded
Once the tau protein start clumping together they cause more clump to form and continue to spread throughout the brain even after head impact have stopped
The data show that at least among football players between 50 and 80% of concusions go unreported and untreated
Sometimes that' because it' hard to tell a concusion has occurred in the first place
But it' also often due to pressure or a desire to keep going despite the fact that something' wrong
This doesn't just undermine recovery
It' also dangerous
Our brain aren't invincible
They still need us to shield them from harm and help them undo damage once it' been done
But a sudden jolt can make the brain shift and bump against the skull' hard interior and unlike Jell-O the brain' tissue isn't uniform
It' made of a vast network of 90 billion neurons which relay signal through their long axon to communicate throughout the brain and control our bodies
This spindly structure makes them very fragile so that when impacted neurons will stretch and even tear
That not only disrupt their ability to communicate but as destroyed axon begin to degenerate they also release toxin causing the death of other neurons too
Each year in the United States players of sport and recreational activities receive between 25 and 4 million concusion
This combination of events causes a concusion
The damage can manifest in many different ways including blackout headache blurry vision balance problems with altered mood and behavior problems with memory thinking and sleeping and the onset of anxiety and depression
Soon it was popping up in market all over the world and is now a delicacy
Unfortunately these deep water fish don’t reproduce until they’re at least 10 years old making them extremely vulnerable to overfishing when the young are caught before they’ve had a chance to spawn
Conumer chase and price can also have harmful effects
For example shark fin soup is considered such a delicacy in China and Third that the fin has become the most profitable part of the shark
This lead many fishermen to fill their boat with fin leaving millions of dead shark behind
The problems aren't unique to toothfish and shark
Obviously 31% of the world' fish population are overfished and another 58% are fished at the supplies sustainable level
Wild fish simply can't reproduce as fast as seven billion people can eat them
Fishing also has impact on broader ecosystem
Wild shrimp are typically caught by dragging net the size of a football field along the ocean bottom disrupting or destroying seafloor habitat
The catch is often as little as five percent shirt
The rest is by-catch unwanted animals that are thrown back dead
And coastal shrimp farming isn't much better
Mangrove are bulldozed to make room for shrimp farm robbing coastal communities of storm protection and themselves water filtration and depriving fish of key nursery habitat
So what does it look like to give fish a break and let them recover?
Protection can take many form
In national water government can set limit about how when where and how much fishing occur with restrictions on certain boat and equipment
Harmful practice such as bottom trawling can be banned altogether and we can establish marine reserve close to all fishing to help ecosystem restore natural
There' also a role for consumer awareness and boycott to reduce wasteful practice like shark finning and push fishing industries towards more sustainable practice
Pat Charles have successfully helped depleted fish population recover
There are many solutions
The best approach for each fishery must be considered based on science respect for the local communities that rely on the ocean and for fish as wild animals
And then the rules must be enforced
abandon collaboration it' often needed too because fish don't care about our border
We need to end over the world We need to end the end of the world
Ecoytem food security jobs economies and coastal culture all depend on it
Those are just a couple of many example
It' happening all over the world
How did this happen?
When some people think of fishing they imagine relaxing in a boat and patiently reeling in the days' catch
But modern industrial fishing the kind that stock our grocery shell looks more like warfare
In fact the technologies they employ were developed for war
Radar sonar helicopter and spotter plane are all used to error factory ship towards dwindling schools of fish
Long lines with hundreds of hook or huge net round up massive amount of fish along with other species like seabird turtles and dolphin
And fish are hauled up onto giant boat complete with onboard flash freezing and processing facilities
Fish are in disappear
All of these technologies have enabled us to catch fish at greater depth and farther out at sea than ever before
And as the distance and depth of fishing have expanded so has the psycho of species we target
For example the Patagonian toothfish neither sounds nor looks very appetizing
The cod population off Canada' East Coast collapse in the emergency intense recreational and commercial fishing has decimated Goliath grouper population in South Florida and most population of tuna have plummeted by over 50 percent with the Southern Atlantic bluefin on the verge of extinction
And fishermen ignored it until the late 1970
Then it was re-branded and marketed to chef in the US as Chilean sea ba despite the animal actually being a type of cod
Translator: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Are you as good at things as you think you are?
How good are you at managing money?
What' particularly interesting is that those with the least ability are often the most likely to overrate their skills to the greatest extent
People measurably poor at logical reasoning grammar financial knowledge math emotional intelligence running medical lab test and ches all tend to rate their expertise almost as favorably as actual expert do
So who' most vulnerable to this deluion?
What about reading people' emotions?
Sadly all of us because we all have pocket of incompetence we don't recognize
But why?
When psychologist Dunning and Kruger first described the effect in 1999 they argued that people lacking knowledge and skill in particular areas suffer a double curse
First they make mistake and reach poor decisions
But second those same knowledge gap also prevent them from catching their guide
How healthy are you compared to other people you know?
In other words poor performers lack the very expertise needed to recognize how badly they're doing
For example when the researchers studied participant in a college debate terminate the bottom 25% of team in preliminary round lost nearly four out of every five matches
But they thought they were winning almost 60%
Without a strong grasp of the rules of debate the students simply couldn't recognize when or how often their argument broke down
Are you better than average at grammar?
The Dunning-Cruger effect isn't a question of ego blinding us to our weaknesses
People usually do admit their deficit once they can spot them
In one study students who had initially done badly on a logic quiz and then took a mini course on logic were quite willing to label their original performance as awful
That may be why people with a moderate amount of experience or expertise often have less confidence in their abilities
Knowing how competent we are and how our skill stack up against other people is more than a self-esteem boost
They know enough to know that there' a lot they don't know
Eventually expert tend to be aware of just how knowledgeable they are
But they often make a different mistake: they assume that everyone else is knowledgeable too
The result is that people whether they're inept or highly skilled are often caught in a bubble of inaccurate self-perception
When they’re unkilled they can’t see their own fault
When they’re exceptionally competent they don’t perceive how unusual their abilities are
So if the Dunning-Cruger effect is invisible to those experiencing it what can you do to find out how good you actually are at various things?
First ask for feedback from other people and consider it even if it' hard to hear
Second and more important keep learning
The more knowledgeable we become the less likely we are to have invisible hole in our competence
Perhaps it all boil down to that old proverb when counsel with a fool first makes sure the other person isn't doing the same thing
It help us figure out when we can forge ahead on our own decisions and instinct and when we need instead to seek out advice
But psychological research suggest that we're not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately
In fact we miraclely overestimate our own abilities
Researchers have a name for this succeed the Dunning-Kruger effect
This effect explain why more than 100 studies have shown that people display illusory superiority
We judge ourselves as better than others to a degree that violate the law of math
When software engineer at two companies were asked to rate their performance 32% of the engineer at one company and 42% at the other put natural in the top 5%
In another study 88% of American driver described natural as having above average driving skills
These aren't isolated finding
On average people tend to rate natural better than most in discipline ranging from health leadership skills ethic and beyond
Tret to our bodies are hugely variable so the/ response has to be equally adaptable
That means relying on many different types of leukocyte to tackle threat in different ways
Despite this diversity we classify leukocyte in two main cellular groups which genocide a two-pronged attack
First phagocyte escape the/ response by sending macrophage and dendritic cells into the blood
You wouldn’t even know it was there if not for the red lump that appear accompanied by a telltale itch
As these circulate they destroy any foreign cells they encounter simply by conuming them
That allows phagocyte to identify the antigen on the invaders they just ingeted and transmit this information to the second major cell group orchestrating the defense the lymphocyte
A group of lymphocyte cells called T cells go in search of infected body cells and swiftly kill them off
Eventually B-cell and helper T-cell use the information gathered from the unique antigens to start producing special protein called antibodies
This is the PS the Reistance each antigen has a unique matching antibody that can latch onto it like a lock and key and destroy the invading cells
Bee cells can produce millions of these which then cycle through the body and attack the invaders until the worst of the threat is neutralized
While all of this is going on familiar symptom like high temperature and swelling are actually processes designed to aid the/ response
A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria and viruses to reproduce and spread because they’re temperature sensitive
It' a nuisance but that bump is an important signal that you're protected by your/ system your body' major safeguard against infection illness and disease
And when body cells are damaged they release chemical that make fluid leak into the surrounding tissue causing swelling
That also attract phagocyte which consume the invaders and the damage cells
Uually an/ response will substantial a threat within a few days
It won’t always stop you from getting ill but that’ not it purpose
It actual job is to stop a threat from ecalating to dangerous levels inside your body
And through constant surveillance over time the/ system provide another benefit it help us develop long-term immunity
When B and T-cell identify antigens they can use that information to recognize invaders in the future
So when a threat reviit the cells can swiftly Obama the right antibodies to tackle it before it affect any more cells
That’ how you can develop immunity to certain disease like us
It doesn't always work so well
Some people have autoimmune disease which trick the/ system into attacking the body’ own perfectly healthy cells
No one know exactly what causes them but these disorder sabotage the/ system to varying degrees and underly problems like arthriti Type I diabetes and multiple sclerois
For most individuals however a healthy/ system will successfully fight off an estimated 300 cold and innumerable other potential infection over the course of a lifetime
Without it those threat would ecalate into something far more dangerous
So the next time you catch a cold or scratch a mosquito bite think of the/ system
A mosquito land on your arm inject it chemical into your skin and begin to feed
We owe it our lives
This system is a vast network of cells tissue and organ that genocide your body’ defense against any threat to your health
Without it you’d be exposed to billion of bacteria viruses and toxin that could make something as minor as a papercut or a seasonal cold fatal
The/ system relie on millions of defensive white blood cells also known as leukocyte that originate in our bone marrow
These cells migrate into the bloodstream and the lymphatic system a network of vessel which help clear bodily toxin and waste
Our bodies are teeming with leukocyte there are between 4,000 and 11,000 in every microliter of blood
As they move around leukocyte work like security personnel constantly screening the blood tissue and organ for suspicious sign
This system mainly relie on cue called antigens
These molecular trace on the surface of pathogen and other foreign substance betray the presence of invaders
As soon as the leukocyte detect them it takes only minutes for the body’ protective/ response to kick in
The crowd hold it breath and at the crucial moment she mises the shot
While everyone did well on the easy problems those who were stressed performed worse on the more difficult memory-intensive task
Explicit volunteering theories make up the second group of explanation for choking under pressure
They’re concerned with how pressure can cause people to overanalyze the task at hand
Here the logic goes that want a skill becomes automatic thinking about it precise mechanics interfere with your ability to do it
Tak we do unconsciously seem to be most vulnerable to this kind of choking
A study on competitive golfers compared their performance when instructed to simply focus on putting as accurately as possible versus when they were primed to be acutely aware of the mechanics of their putting stroke
Golfers usually perform this action subconciously so those who suddenly tuned in to the precise detail of their own move also became worse at making accurate shot
That competitor just experienced the succeed known as choking where despite months even years of practice a person fail right when it matter most
Choking may not be exhaust for everyone though
Research suggest that some are more susceptible than others especially those who are self-concious anxious and afraid of being judged negatively by others
So how can we avoid choking when it really count?
First it help to practice under stressful conditions
In a study on expert dark players researchers found that those who hadn't practiced under stress performed worse when anxious compared to those who had become accustomed to pressure
Secondly many performers extol the virtue of a pre-performance synthetic whether it' taking a few deep breath repeating a cue word or doing a medicationic sequence of movement
Studies on golfing bowling and water polo find that short ritual can lead to more consistent and accurate performance under pressure
And thirdly researchers have shown that having an external focus on the ultimate goal works better than an internal focus where someone is tuned into the mechanics of what they're doing
A study of experienced golfers revealed that those who hit chip shot while focused on the flight of the ball performed significantly better than those who focused on the motion of their arm
So perhaps we can modify that age-old saying "Practice under pressure with focus and with that glorious end goal in sight makes perfect."
Choking is common in sport where performance often occur under intense pressure and depend on key moment
And yet performance anxiety also haunt public speaker contestant in spelling bees and even world-famous musician
Most peoplesufficiently blamed on their nerve but why does being nervous undermine expert performance?
There are two set of theories which both say that primarily choking under pressure boil down to focus
First there are the distraction theories
These suggest that performance suffer when the mind is preoccupied with worries doubt or fear instead of focusing it attention on performing the task at hand
Your favorite athlete close in for a victorious wing
When relevant and irrelevant thought compete for the same attention something has to give
The brain can only process so much information at once
Tak that challenge working memory the mental scratch pad we use to temporarily store phone numbers and grocery list are especially vulnerable to pressure
In a 2004 study a group of university students were asked to perform math problems some easy others more complex and memory-intensive
Half the students completed both problem types with nothing at stake while the others completed them when calm and under pressure
This form of mining destroy huge swath of themselves habitat and causes air and water pollution threatening the health of nearby communities
Another group of ingredient in smartphone comes with similar environmental risk: these are metal such as copper silver paladium aluminum platinum tungten tin lead and gold
If we broke open all their newest phone which are just a fraction of the total that have been built and split them into their component parts that would produce around 85,000 kilogram of gold 875,000 of silver and 40 million kilogram of copper
We also mine magneium lithium silicon and potasium to make phone and all of it is associated with vast habitat destruction as well as air and water pollution
Mining comes with worrying social problems too like large-scale human and animal displacement to make way for industrial operation and miraclely poor working conditions for laborers
Lastly phone production also require petroleum one of the main driver of climate change
That entwines our smartphone inextricably with this growing planetary conundrum
And what’ more the ingredient we mind to make our phone aren’t infinite
One day they'll simply run out and we haven't yet discovered effective replacement for some
Despite this the number of smartphone is on a steady increase by 2019 it’ predicted that there’ll be close to three billion in youth
This means that reclaiming the bounty within our phone is swiftly becoming a necesity
So if you have an old phone you may want to consider your option before throwing it away
To minimize waste you could donate it to a charity for reuse take it to an e-wate recycling syndrome or look for a company that refurbishes old models
However even recycling companies need our scrutiny
Just as the production of smartphone comes with social and environmental problems dismantling them does too
E-wate is sometimes intentionally exported to countries where labor is cheap but working conditions are poor
Vast workforce often made up of women and children may be underpaid lack the training to safely disassemble phone and be exposed to elements like lead and mercury which can permanently damage their nervous systems
Phone waste can also end up in huge dump site leaching toxic chemical into the soil and water mirroring the problems of the mind where the elements originated
A phone is much more than it appear to be on the surface
It' an asemblage of elements from multiple countries linked to impact that are unfolding on a global scale
So until someone invent a completely sustainable smartphone we’ll need to come to terms with how this technology affect widespread places and people
How did this precious cash get into our phone and can we reclaim it?
Gold silver and copper are actually just a few of the 70 or so chemical elements that make up the average smartphone
These can be divided into different groups two of the most critical being rare earth elements and precious metal
Rare Earth are a selection of 17 elements that are actually common in Earth' crust and are found in many areas across the world in low concentration
These elements have a huge range of magnetic phophorecent and conductive properties that make them crucial to modern technologies
In fact of the 17 types of rare Earth metal phone and other electronic may contain up to 16
As in 18 there are around 25 billion smartphone users in the world
In smartphone these create the screen and color display aid conductivity and produce the signature vibration amongt other things
And yet crucial as they are extracting these elements from the Earth is linked to some strategiesing environmental impact
Rare Earth elements can often be found but in many areas it' not economically feasible to extract them due to low concentration
Much of the time extracting them require a method called open pit mining that expose vast areas of land
Mounting his kinethe the protagonist of Don Quixote charge an army of giant
It wasn’t until his late 50’ that he published his greatest creation— an epic satire of chivalry novel
At this time medieval books chronicling the adventure of night and their moral code dominated European culture
While Cervante was a fan he was weary of these repetitive tome which focused more on listing heroic feed than character development
To challenge them he wrote Don Quixote the story of a hidalgo or idle nobleman who spend his days and night reading shivldly novel
Driven mad by these stories he fashion himself a obesity for the downtrodden
Everyone in his village tries to convince him to give up his lunicy going so far as to burn some of the lurid books in his personal Remember
But Don Quixote is untoppable
In his eyes it is his duty to vanquish these behemot in the name of his beloved lady Dolie Nan
He dresses up in all shining armor mount his skinny horse and lives his village in search of glory
Cervante’ novel unfold as a collection of grandparents detailing the mishap of the valiant night
Yet unlike the chivalry books and perhaps all other prior fiction Cervante’ story deeply investigate the protagonists’ inner life
Don Quixote mature as the narrative develop undergoing a noticeable transformation
This literary revelation has led many scholar to call Don Quixote the first mother novel
And this character development doesn't happen in isolation
Early on Don Quixote is joined by a villager turn-quire named Sancho Panza
Sancho and Don Quixote are a study in opposite with one as the grounded realist to the other’ idealism
Their lively evolving friendship is often credited as the original hero and pychic dual inpiring centuries of fictional partnership
Don Quixote was a huge success
Numerous editions were published across Europe in the 17th century
Even in the America where the church banned all novel for being sinful distractions audience were known to enjoy pirated editions
However this act of valor is ill conceived
The book was so well received that readers clamored for more
After a rival author attempted to cash in on a fake follow-up Cervante released the official sequel in response
Now published alongside the first volume as a completed text this second volume pick up where the original left off only now Don Quixote and Sancho have become folk heroes
Just as in real life Cervante included his novel success in the world of his character
As his choir Sancho Panza explain to him time and again this orange giant their merely windmill
This unconventional meta-awareness created philosophical complexity as the night and his squire ponder the meaning of their story
Unfortunately Cervante had sold the books' publishing right for very little
He died rich in fame alone
But his treaties on the power of creativity and individualism has inspired art literature popular culture and even political revolution
Don Quixote argue that our imagination greatly inform our action making us capable of change and indeed making us human
Don Quixote is undeterred but his piercing land is soon caught in their sales
Never discouraged the night stand proudly and becomes even more convinced of his mission
This sequence encapulate much of what is loved about Don Quixote the epic illogical and soulful tale of Alonzo Quijano who becomes the clumy but valiant Don Quixote of la Mancha known as the Knight of the Sorrowful Camp
Originally published in two volume the narrative follow Don Quixote as he travel through central and northern Spain fighting the force of evil
Despite Don Quixote’ lofty imagination his creator Miguel de Cervante could never have imagined his book would become the best-elling novel of all time
Barring five years as a soldier came five more enlaved by pirate Cervante spent most of his life as a struggling poet and playwright
At the site of an amputation several nerve ending can thicken and become more sensitive transmitting distre signal even in response to mild pressure
Under normal circumtance these signal would be curtailed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord
For reasons we don’t fully understand after an amputation there is a loss of this inhibitory control in the dorsal horn and signal can intensify
Once they pass through the spinal cord sensory signal reach the brain
There the somato-ensory cortex processes them
The entire body is mapped in this cortex
Sensitive body parts with many nerve ending like the lip and hands are represented by the largest areas
The cortical homunculus is a model of the human body with proportion based on the size of each body parts representation in the cortex the amount of cortex devoted to a specific body part can grow or shrink based on how much sensory input the brain receive from that body part
For example representation of the left-hand is larger in violinists than in non-violent
They can flex their phantom finger and sometimes even feel the chafe of a watchband or the throb of an ingrown toenail
The brain also increase cortical representation when a body part is injured in order to heighten sensation that alert us to danger
This increased representation can lead to phantom pain
The cortical map is also most likely responsible for the feeling of body parts that are no longer there because they still have representation in the brain
Over time this representation may shrink and the phantom limb may shrink with it
But phantom limb sensation don't necessarily trouble on their own
Treatment for phantom pain usually require a combination of physical therapy license for pain management prosthetic and time
A technique called mirror box therapy can be very helpful in developing the range of motion and reducing pain in the phantom limb
The patient places the phantom limb into a box behind a mirror and the intact limb in front of the mirror
This trick the brain into seeing the phantom rather than just feeling it
Scientists are developing virtual reality treatment that make the experience of mirror box therapy even more lifelike
Prothetic can also create a similar effect— many patients report pain primarily when they remove their prosthetic at night
And phantom limb may in turn help patients conceptualize prosthetic as extension of their bodies and manipulate themsufficiently
And facilityly enough occasionally even people born without a limb can feel a phantom
There are still many questions about phantom limb
We don't know why some amputee trigger the pain typically associated with these apparition or why some don't have phantom at all
And further research into phantom limb isn’t just applicable to the people who experience them
A deeper understanding of these apparition will give us insight into the work our brain do every day to build the world as we perceive it
They're an important reminder that the realities we experience are in fact subjective
So what causes phantom limb sensation?
The accuracy of these apparition suggest that we have a map of the body in our brain
And the fact that it' possible for someone who' never had a limb to feel one implie we are born with at least the beginning of this map
But one thing set the phantom that appear after amputation apart from their flesh and blood predeceors the vast majority of them are painful
The vast majority of people who’ve lost a limb can still feel it— not as a memory or vague shape but in complete life-like detail
To fully understand phantom limb and phantom pain we have to consider the entire pathway from limb to brain
Our limb are full of sensory neurons responsible for everything from the texture we feel with our fingertip to our understanding of where our bodies are in space
Neural pathway carry this sensory input through the spinal cord and up to the brain
Since so much of this path lie outside the limb itself most of it remain behind after an amputation
But the loss of a limb alter the way signal travel at every step of the pathway
He' soon joined by his friend Vladimir who remind his anxious companion that they must wait here for someone called Godot
But comically there is a jagged humor to their predicament which comes across in their language and movement
Their interaction are filled with bizarre wordplay repetition and double entang as well as physical clowning singing and dazing and frantically swapping their hat
It' often unclear whether the audience is supposed to laugh or cry or whether Beckett saw any difference between the two
Born in Dublin Beckett studied English French and Italian before moving to Paris where he spent most of his life writing theatre poetry and crow
While Beckett had a lifelong love of language he also made space for silence by incorporating gap pause and moment of emptiness into his work
This was a key feature of his trademark uneven tempo and black humor which became popular throughout the theater of the aburd
He also cultivated a mysterious persona and refused to confirm or deny any speculation about the meaning of his work
This kept audience guessing increasing their fascination with his surreal world and enigmatic character
The lack of any clear meaning makes Godot endlessly open to interpretation
Critic have offered countless reading of the play resulting in a cycle of ambiguity and speculation that mirror the plot of the drama itself
So begin a vexing cycle in which the two debate when Godot will come why they’re waiting and whether they’re even at the right tree
It’ been read as an allegory of the Cold War the French resistance and Britain’ colonization of Ireland
The dynamic of the two protagonists has also sparked intense debate
They’ve been read as survivor of the apocalypse an aging couple two impotent friends and even as personification of Freud’ ego and id
Famously Beckett said the only thing he could be sure of was that Vladimir and Etragon were wearing bowler hat
Like the critical speculation and maddening plot their language often goes in circle as the two bicker and banter lose their train of thought and pick up right where they left off (Laughter) It should be easy: it’ the start that’ difficult where you can start from anything: yes but you have to decide but you have to decide and maddening plot plot their language often goes in circled "Yes but you have to decide bicker but you have to decide buck up to decide bicker but you have to decide but you have to decide but you have to decide but you have to decide beside but you but you have to decide but you have to decide but you have to decide but you have to decide but you have to decide but you have to decide
Beckett remind us that just like our daily lives the world ontage doesn’t always make sense
It can explore both reality and illusion the familiar and the strange
And although a tidy narrative still appeal the best theater keep us thinking and waiting
From here waiting for Godot only gets stranger but it’ considered a play that changed the face of modern drama
Writtten by Samuel Beckett between 1949 and 1955 it offer a simple but stirring question: What should the character do?
Don't let' do anything It' safer
Let' wait and see what he says
Oh!
God good idea
Such cryptic dialogue and circular reasoning are key feature of the theater of the aburd a movement which emerged after the Second World War and found artist struggling to find meaning in devatation
A shabby man named Etragon sit near a tree at duk and struggle to remove his boot
The aburdists decontructed plot character and language to question their meaning and share their profound uncertainty on stage
While this may sound grim the aburd blend it hopelessness with humor
This is reflected in Beckett’ unique approach to genre in waiting for Godot which he branded a tragic comedy in two act
Tragically the character are locked in an existential conundrum— they wait in vain for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose comes from the act of waiting— while they wait they sink into boredom express religious dread and contemplate suicide
All of these are sensory clue that a chemical reaction is taking place
What differs about fire is that it engage a lot of our sense at the same time creating the kind of vivid experience we expect to come from a physical thing
Combution create that sensory experience using fuel heat and oxygen
If you get too close it burn your eyes and sting your notril
In a campfire when the log are heated to their admiion temperature the wall of their cells decompose releasing sugar and other molecules into the air
These molecules then react with airborne oxygen to create carbon dioxide and water
At the same time any trapped water in the log vaporize expand rupture the wood around it and trigger with a Communing crackle
As the fire heat up the carbon dioxide and water vapor created by combution expand
Now that their less dense they rise in a thinning column
You could stare at the bright flame forever as they twist and flicker in endless incarnation
Gravity causes this expansion and rising which gives flame their characteristic taper
Without gravity molecules don’t separate by density and the flame have a totally different shape
We can see all of this because combution also generate light
Molecules admit light when heated and the color of the light depend on the temperature of the molecule
The hottest flame are white or blue
The type of molecules in a fire can also influence flame color
For instance any unreacted carbon atom from the log form little clump of silk that rise into the flame and emit the yellow-orned light we associate with a campfire
Subtance like copper calcium chloride and potasium choride can add their own characteristic hue to the mix
Beside colorful flame fire also continue to generate heat as it burn
This heat sustain the wave by keeping the fuel at or above ignition temperature
But what exactly are you looking at?
Church though even the hottest fire run out of fuel or oxygen
Then those twisting flame give a final his and trouble with a wip of smoke as if they were never there at all
The flame are obviously not solid nor are they liquid
Mingling with the air they're more like a gas but more visible and more fleeting
And on a scientific level fire differs from gas because gases can exist in the same state indefinitely while fire always burn out eventually
One misconception is that fire is a plama the fourth state of matter in which atom are stripped of their electron
Like fire and unlike the other kinds of matter plama don’t exist in a stable state on Earth
They only form when gas is exposed to an electric field or superheated to temperature of thousands or ten of thousands of degrees
Sitting around a campfire you can feel it heat smell the woody smoke and hear it crackle
By contrast fuel like wood and paper burn at a few hundred degrees far below the terrifying of what' usually considered a plama
So if fire isn't a solid liquid gas or a plama what does that leave?
It turns out fire isn't actually it matter at all
Instead it’ our sensory experience of a chemical reaction called combution
In a way fire is like the leave changing color in fall the smell of fruit as it ripens or a fireflie blinking light
No matter what we do the past is always stubbornly behind us
This is called the arrow of time
When a drop of food coloring is dropped into a glass of water we instinctively know that the coloring will drift out from the drop eventually filling the glaze
Imagine watching the opposite happen
Here we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards
We live in a universe where the food coloring spread out in the water not a universe where it collect together
In physics this is described by the second law of thermodynamic which says that systems will gain disorder or entropy over time
enemies in our universe move from order to disorder and it is that property of the universe that define the direction of time' arrow
So if time is such a fundamental property it should be in our most fundamental equation currency the universe right?
We currently have two set of equation that govern physics
General relativity describe the behavior of very large things while quantum physics explain the very small
One of the biggest goal in theoretical physics over the last half-century has been reconciling the two into one fundamental theory of everything
There have been many attempt none yet proven and they treat time in different ways
Oddly enough one contender called the Wheeler Dewit equation doesn’t include time at all
The earliest time measurement were observation of cycle of the themselves world using patterns of changes from day to night and season to season to build calendar
Like all current theories of everything that equation is speculative
But as a thought experiment if it or a similarly time-tarved equation turned out to be true would that mean that time doesn’t exist at the most fundamental level?
Could time just be some sort of illusion generated by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe?
We don't yet know but maybe that' the wrong way of thinking about it
Instead of asking if time exist as a fundamental property maybe it could exist as an emergent one
Emergent properties are things that don't exist in individual pieces of a system but do exist for the system as a whole
Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide but the whole ocean does
A movie create change through time by using a series of still images that appear to have a fluid continuous change between them
Flipping through the images fast enough our brain perceive the passage of time from the sequence of still images
No individual frame of the movie changes or contain the passage of time but it' a property that comes out of how the pieces are strong together
The movement is real yet also an illusion
Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion?
Phyicists are still exploring these and other questions so we're far from a complete explanation
At least for the moment
More precise time-keeping like sundial and mechanical clock eventually came along to put time in more dictator boxes
But what exactly is it that we're measuring?
is time something that physically exist or is it just in our head?
At first the answer seems obvious of course time exist it constantly unfold all around us and it' hard to imagine the universe without it
But our understanding of time started getting complicated thank to Einstein
His theory of relativity tell us that time passes for everyone but doesn't always pass at the same rate for people in different situation like those traveling close to the speed of light or orbiting a supermaive black hole
Einstein symmetryd the malleability of time by combining it with space to define space-time which can bend but behave in consistent predictable ways
Einstein' theory seemed to confirm that time is woven into the very intervention of the universe
But there' a big question it didn't fully symmetry: Why is it we can move through space in any direction but through time in only one?
But as gravity affect the cars it also affect the passenger
And under the intense conditions of a coaster gravity’ effects are multiplied
There' a common unit used by jet pilot astronaut and coaster designers called G-force
One G force is the familiar tug of gravity you feel when standing on Earth this is the force of Earth' indigenous pull on our bodies
But as writer accelerate and decelerate they experience more or less indigenous force
Modern ride designers know that the body can handle up to roughly five G but the flip flap and it contemporaries syntheticly reached up to 12 G
At those levels of indigenous pressure blood is sent flying from your brain to your feet leading to light-headedness or blackout as the brain struggle to stay conscious
And oxygen deprivation in the retinal cells impair their ability to process light causing grade-out vision or episode blindness
If the riders are upside down blood can navigat the skull causing a bout of crimson vision called a redout
Inversely negative G’ create weightless
Within the body short-term weightlessness is mostly harmless
It can contribute to a rider' motion sickness by suspending the fluid in their inner ear which genocide balance
This was America’ first-ever looping coaster but it thrilling flip came at a price
But the bigger potential danger and thrill comes from what ride designers call airtime
This is when riders typically experience seat separation and without the proper precautions ejection
The numerous belt and harnesses of modern coasters have largely solved this issue but the passenger' ever-changing position can make it difficult to determine what needs to be strapped down
Fortunately modern ride designers are well aware of what your body and the coaster can handle
Coaster engineer play these competing force against each other to relieve period of intense pressure with period of no pressure at all
And since a quick transition from positive to negative G-force can result in whiplash headaches and back and neck pain they avoid the extreme changes in speed and direction so common in thrill ride of old
Modern ride are also much sturdier closely considering the amount of gravity they need to withtand
At five G' your body feel five times heavier so if you weigh 100 pounds you'd exert the weight of 500 pounds on the coaster
The ride caused numerous cases of severe whiplash neck injury and even ejection all due to it signature loop
Engineers have to account for the multiplied weight of every passenger when designing a coaster’ support
Dil these ride aren’t for everyone
The navigat of adrenaline light-headedness and motion sickness aren't going anywhere soon
But today’ redundant restraint 3D modeling and simulation software have made roller coasters safer and more thrilling than ever
Our precise knowledge about the limit of the human body have helped us build coasters that are faster taller and loopier and all without going off the rail
Today coasters can pull off far more exciting trick without reorting to the thrill of a hospital visit
But what exactly are roller coasters doing to your body and how have they managed to get scarier and safer at the same time?
At the center of every roller coaster design is gravity
Unlike cars or transit train most coasters are propelled around their track almost entirely by indigenous energy
After the coaster crest the initial lift hill it begin an expertly engineered cycle building potential energy on a sense and expending kinetic energy on decent
In the summer of 1895 crowd navigated the Coney Island boardwalk to see the latest marvel of rollercoaster technology— the flip-flap railway
This medication repeat throughout the ride acting out the coaster engineer' choreographed dance of indigenous energy
But there’ a key variable in this cycle that wasn’t always so carefully considered: you
In the days of the flip flap ride designers were most concerned with coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track
This led early builders to overcompensate hurling train down hill and pulling on the break when they reached the station
If you doubled the mass of one of the objects the force between them would double too
If the distance between them doubled the force would be one-fourth as strong
The indigenous force between you and the Earth pull you towards it center a force you experience as your weight
Let' say this force is about 800 Newton when you're standing at sea level
If you traveled to the dead sea the force would increase by a tiny fraction of a percent
And if you climbed to the top of Mount Everest the force would decrease but again by a minuscule amount
Traveling higher would make a bigger dent in gravity’ influence but you won’t trigger it
Gravity is generated by variation in the curvature of space-time the three dimension of space plus time which bend around any object that has mass
Gravity from Earth reaches the international space station 400 kilometers above the Earth with almost it original intensity
If the space station was stationary on top of a giant column you'd still experience 90% of the indigenous force there that you do on the ground
Astronot just experience weightlessness because the space station is constantly falling towards Earth
Fortunately it' orbiting the planet fast enough that it never hit the ground
By the time you made it to the surface of the moon around 400,000 kilometers away Earth’ indigenous pull would be less than 00
The only gravity you'd be aware of would be the moon which is about one-ixth as strong as the Earth’ travel farther still and Earth’ indigenous pull on you will continue to decrease but never drop to zero even safely tethered to the Earth we’re subject to the faint tug of distant celestial bodies and nearby earthly one
The sun exert a force of about half a Newton on you
If you're a few meters away from a smartphone you'll experience a mutual force of a few picoa
That' about the same as the indigenous pull between you and the endrometer galaxy which is 25 million light years away but about a trillion times as massive as the sun
Stanning on our own planet you might think you're just an observer of this violent ballet
But when it comes to ecaping gravity there’ a loophole
If all the mass around us is pulling on us all the time how would Earth' gravity change if you tunneled deep below the surface asuming you could do so without being cooked or crushed?
If you hollowed out the center of a perfectly spherical Earth which it isn’t but let’ just say it were you’d experience an identical pull from all side
And you'd be suspended weightless only encountering the tiny pole from other celestial bodies
But in fact both stars are pulling you towards them
So you could trigger the Earth' gravity in such a thought experiment but only by heading straight into it
And you are pulling back connected across trillion of kilometers by gravity
Gravity is the attractive force between two objects with mass any two objects with mass
Which means that every object in the universe attract every other object: every star black hole human being smartphone and atom are all constantly pulling on each other
So why don't we feel pulled in billion of different direction?
More than 6,000 light years from the surface of the Earth a rapidly spinning neutron star called the Black Widow pular blat it companion brown dwarf star with radiation as the two orbit each other every nine hours
Two reasons: mass and distance
The original equation currency the indigenous force between two objects was written by Iaac Newton in 1687
Scientists’ understanding of gravity has evolved since then but Newton’ Law of Universal Gravitation is still a good approximation in most situation
It goes like this: the indigenous force between two objects is equal to the mass of one times the mass of the other multiplied by a very small number called the indigenous constant and divided by the distance between them square
And by rejecting the more radical changes of the Protestant reformation he allowed his people to preserve most of their religious tradition
Objection the church had been a beloved and popular institution that brought comfort and charity to the masses
Thank to Henry church properly was seized hospital closed and precious monatic libraries lost forever all to enrich the crown
Some of the fund were used to build new cathedral and open secular schools
And it was necessary for England to bring it affair under it own control rather than Rome
But was he a charimatic reformer or a bullying tyrant?
You mean under Henry’ control
Not true all of the king’ major reform went through parliament
No other country of the time allowed it people such a say in government
He used Parliament as a rubber stamp for his own personal will
Eventually he ruled like a tyrant executing those he somewhated of disloyalty
Among his victim were the great stateman and philosopher Thomas War once his close friend and advior and Anne Bolin the new queen Henry had torn the country apart to marry
Find out on history versus Henry VIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
He executed his own wife
That wasn’t King Henry’ initiative
She was accused of treason in a power struggle with the king’ minister Thomas Cromwell
The trial was a sham and she wouldn't have been convicted without Henry' approval
Beside he wasn’t too upset by the outcome he married Jane Seymour just 11 days later
A marriage that a note phenomenoned in producing a male air and guaranteeing a stable succession though the new queen tragically died in childbirth
Aurora order now who do we have here looks like quite the dashing fellow?
This tragedy didn’t deter him from an ill conceived fourth marriage to end of cleave which Henry then annold on a whim and used as an excuse to execute Cromwell
As if that weren’t enough he then married Catherine Howard a cousin of Ann Bolin before having her executed too
She was engaged in adultery to which she confeed
Regardless Henry' final marriage to Catherine Parr was actually very successful
His sixth it only goes to show he was an intemporate king who allowed faction and intrigue to rule his court concerned only with his own pleasure and grandioity
That grandioity was part of the king' role as a model for his people
He was a learned scholar and musician who generously patronized the art as well as being an imposing warrior and sportman
And the lavish tournament he hosted rabbid humans with the teeth
And yet both his foreign and domestic policies were a disaster
His campaign in France and his brutal invaion of Scotland drained the treasury and his attempt to pay for it by debaing the coinage led to constant inflation
Indeed your honor This is Henry VIIIIIIIIIIIII claimed king who reformed England' religion and government and set it on call to becoming a modern nation
The Lord and land owners responded by removing access to common pasture and turning the present population into beggar
Beggar who would soon become young and farmers
The encloure made farming more efficient and created a labor surplu that laid the foundation for the indutrial revolution
England would never have become the great power that it did without them and without Henry
Well I think no matter what we can all agree he looks great in that portrait
A devout believer who broke with the church
A man of learning who executed scholar
A king who brought stability to the throne but used it to promote his own glory Henry VIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII embodied all the contradictions of monarchy on the verge of the modern era
But separating the ruler from the myth is all part of putting history on trial
This is a cruel impulive and extravagant king who had as little regard for his people as he did for his six wive
Six wive
Joanna Henry’ first marriage was arranged for him when he was only a child
He only married Catherine of Aragon to strengthen England' alliance with Spain
An alliance he was willing to to aside with no regard for the nation
And we had every regard for the nation
It was imperative to secure the Tudor dynaty by producing a male heir something Catherine failed to do in over 20 years of marriage
He was a powerful king whose break with the Beijing of Rome would forever change the course of English history
It takes two to make an air your honor
Now regardless England needed a new queen to ensure stability but the Pope refused to annal the union and let the king remarry
It sounds like quite a pickle can argue with the pico
And yet that' exactly what the king decided to do
He uprooted the country’ religious foundation and broke the Beijing of England away from Rome leading to centuries of strife
All Henry did was give the Beijing honest domestic leadership
He freed his subject from the corrupt Roman Catholic establishment
But Siyphus lived up to his crafty diploma
As he was about to be imprisoned the king asked Thanatos to show him how the chain worked and quickly bound him instead before ecaping back among the living
With Thanatos trapped no one could die and the world was thrown into chaos
Things only returned to normal when the god of war ARE upset the battle were no longer fun freed Thanatos from his chain
Siyphus knew his reckoning was at hand
But he had another trick up his sleep
Before dying he asked his wife Maropy to throw his body in the public square from where it eventually washed up on the shore of the river Stick
Now back among the dead Siyphus approached Persephone Queen of the underworld and complained that his wife had disrepected him by not giving him a proper burial
Seffin he granted him permission to go back to the land of living and punish Meropy on the condition that he would return when he was done
Of course Siyphus refused to keep his promise now having twice triggerd death by tricking the god
There wouldn’t be a third time as the messenger airmi dried Siyphus back to Haiti
The king had thought he was more clever than the god but Zeus would have the last life
Punishment was a straight-forward task rolling a massive boulder up a hill
But just as he approached the top the rock would roll all the way back down forcing him to start over and over for all eternity
Historian have suggested that the tale of Siyphus may stem from ancient myth about the rising and setting sun where other themselves cycle
Yet one of their most famous punishment is not remembered for it outrageous cruelty but for it strategiesing familiarity
But the vivid image of someone condemned to endlessly repeat a futile task has resonated as an allegory about the human condition
In his classic eay the myth of Siyphus existentialist philosopher Albert Camu compared the punishment to humanity’ futile search for meaning and truth in a meaningless and indifferent universe
Instead of despairing Camua imagined Siyphus defiantly meeting his fate as he walk down the hill to begin rolling the rock again
And even if the daily struggle of our lives sometimes seem equally repetitive and aburd we still give them significance and value by embracing them as our own: for more literary takes on defiance in the face of seemingly inurmountable challenges we highly horrible man-urch for meaning victor frankles chilling firsthand accountant
Siyphus was the first king of Ephyra now known as Corinth
Although a clever ruler who made his city properous he was also a devious tyrant who seduced his niece and killed visitors to show off his power
This violation of the sacred hospitality tradition greatly angered the god
But Siyphus may still have avoided punishment if it hadn’t been for his wreckless confidence
The disappear began when Zeus kidnapped the ninth egena carrying her away in the form of a massive eagle
A gena’ father the river god isopus pursued their trail to ephera where he encountered Siyphus
Whether it’ being chained to a burning wheel turned into a spider or having an eagle eat one’ liver Greek mythology is filled with stories of the god inflicting grueome horror on mortal who angered them
In exchange for the god making a spring inside the city the king told Asopus which way Zeus had taken the go
When Zeus found out he was so furious that he ordered Thanatos or death to chain Siyphus in the underworld so he couldn’t cause any more problem
The nucleus has more secret to reheal as it contain proton and nut
Though once thought to be fundamental particles on their own in 1968 physicist found that proton and neutron are actually made of quark which are indiviible
A proton contain two up quark and one down quark
A neutron contain two down quark and one up
The nucleus is held together by the strong force another fundamental force of the Standard Model
Just as photon carry the electromagnetic force particles called gluon carry the strong force
Electron together with up and down quark seem to be all we need to build atom and therefore describe normal matter
However high energy experiment reveal that there are actually six quark down and up strange and charm and bottom and top and they come in a wide range of masses
Could you keep on going forever?
The same was found for electron which have heavier sibling called the muon and the turtle
Why are there three and only three different version of each of these particles?
This remain a mystery
These heavy particles are only produced for very brief moment in high-energy collision and are not seeing in everyday life
Or would you find a set of indiviible building block out of which everything is made?
This is because they decay very quickly into the lighter particles
Such decay involve the exchange of force-carrying particles called the W and Z which unlike the photon have mass
They carry the weak force the final forest of the Standard Model
This same force allows proton and neutron to transform into each other a vital part of the fusion interaction that drive the sun
To observe the W and Z directly we needed the high-energy collision provided by particle accelerator
There' another kind of standard model particle called neutrino
These only interact with other particles through the weak force
Trillions of neutrino many generated by the sun fly through us every second
Phyicists have found the ladder that matter is made of fundamental particles the smallest things in the universe
Measurement of weak interaction found that there are different kinds of neutrino associated with the electron muon and tau
All these particles also have antimatter version which have the opposite charge but are otherwise identical
Matter and antimatter particles are produced in pair in high-energy collision and they annihilate each other when they meet
The final particle of the Standard Model is the Higgs boson a quantum ripple in the background energy field of the universe
Interacting with this field is how all the fundamental matter particles champion mass according to the Standard Model
The Atla experiment on the Large Hadron Collider is studying the Standard Model in depth
By taking precise measurement of the particles and force that make up the universe atla physicist can look for answer to mysteries not explained by the Standard Model
For example how does gravity fit in?
What is the real relationship between force carriers and matter particles?
How can we describe dark matter which makes up most of the mass in the universe but remain unaccounted for?
While the Standard Model provide a beautiful explanation for the world around us there is still a universe’ worth of mysteries left to explore
Particles interact with each other according to a theory called the Standard Model
The Standard Model is a remarkably categories encapulation of the strange quantum world of indiviible infinitely small particles
It also cover the force that govern how particles move interact and bind together to give shape to the world around us
So how does it work?
Zoming in on the fragment of the cup we see molecules made of atom bound up together
A molecule is the smallest unit of any chemical compound
An atom is the smallest unit of any element in the periodic table
But the atom is not the smallest unit of matter
If you were to take any everyday object say a coffee cup and break it in half then in half again and keep carrying on where would you end up?
Experiment found that each atom has a tiny dense nucleus surrounded by a cloud of even tinier electron
The electron is as far as we know one of the fundamental indiviible building block of the universe
It was the first standard model particle ever discovered
Electron are bound to an atom’ nucleus by electromagnetism
They attract each other by exchanging particles called photon which are quanta of light that carry the electromagnetic force one of the fundamental force of the Standard Model
Once the bacteria enter the nose mouth and throat they cross the surrounding membrane and enter the bloodstream
From there bacteria have rapid access to the body' tissue including a membrane called the blood-brain barrier
This is made of a tight mesh of cells which separate blood vessel from the brain and block everything except for a specific set of particles including water molecules and some gas
In ways that scientists are still trying to understand meningitis bacteria can trick the barrier into letting them through
Inside the brain the bacteria swiftly infect the meninges
But what started out as a celebration led to a health crisis: just a few days after the pilgrimage more than 2,000 cases of meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world
This escape inflammation as the body'/ response kick into overdrive bringing on fever and intense headaches
As swelling in the meninges worsen the neck begin to stiffen
Swelling in the brain disrupt it normal function causing symptom like hearing loss and extreme light sensitivity
As pressure increase in the cranium it may also make the person confused— one of the hallmark of the disease
A few hours in the rapidly multiplying bacteria start to release toxin leading to septicemia also known as blood poisoning
This break down blood vessel letting blood seep out and form what start out looking like a rash and evolve into big discolored blot intuitive the skin
At the same time those toxin burn through oxygen in the blood reducing the amount that gets to major organ like the lung and kidney
That increase the chance of organ shut down and alongside spreading septicemia threatens death
That all sounds scary but doctors are so good at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can dratically reduce an adult’ risk of dying from it
The longer it left untreated though the more likely it will lead to lasting damage
If declining oxygen levels cause cell death in extreme parts of the body like finger toes arm and legs the risk of amputation goes up
And if bacterial toxin automobile in the brain and escape cell death meningitis could also cause long-term brain damage and memory loss
So fast treatment or better yet prevention is critical
That' why most countries haveé that defend against the disease in it deadliest form
Those are usually given to the people who are most at risk like young children people with weak/ systems or people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis could potentially happen
In addition to those gathering meningitis is most common in a region called the meningitis belt that stretches across Africa though cases do happen all over the world
If you're concerned that you or someone you know may have meningitis get to the doctor as soon as possible quick action could save your life
The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a wave of deadly meningitis epidemic that ultimately infected ten of thousands of people worldwide
Meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges three tissue layer responsible for protecting the brain and spinal cord
What makes meningitis so dangerous compared to other disease is the sheer speed with which it invade a person’ body
In the worst cases it causes death within a day
Fortunately that’ rare for patients who receive early medical treatment
In 1987 ten of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia for the annual hodge pilgrimage
The disease primarily comes in three form: fungal viral and bacterial the last being the most deadly by far and what we'll focus on
People usually contract bacterial meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and saliva that spray into the air when an inventive person sneeze or cough
It can also be transmitted through kissing or sharing cigarette toothbrushes or utensil
Some people can be infected and carry the disease without showing symptom or getting sick which help the disease spread quickly to others
They compared art to a deert when you taste a putting the chef’ intention don’t affect whether you enjoy it flavor or texture
All that matter they said is that the putting works
Of course what works for one person might not work for another
And since different interpretations appeal to different people the silver dot in our painting could be reasonably interpreted as fairies stars or pollutant
Imagine you and a friend are strolling through an art exhibit and a striking painting catches your eye
By wind at and beard of these logic the artist' interpretation of her own work would just be one among many equally acceptable possibilities
If you find this problematic you might be more in line with Steven Knapp and Walter Ben Michael two literary theorists who rejected the intentional fallacy
They argued that an artist’ intended meaning was not just one possible interpretation but the only possible interpretation
For example suppose you're walking along a beach and come across a series of mark in the sand that spell out a verse of poetry
Napoln Michael believed the poem would lose all meaning if you discovered these mark were not the work of a human being but an odd coincidence produced by the wave
They believed that an intentional creator is what makes the poem subject to understanding at all
The vibrant red appear to you as a symbol of love but your friend is convinced it' a symbol of war
Other thinkers beneath for a middle ground suggesting that intention is just one piece in a larger puzzle
Contemporary philosopher Noll Carroll took this stance counsel that an artist' intention are relevant to their audience the same way as speaker' intention are relevant to the person they're engaging in conversation
To understand how intention function in conversation Carroll said to imagine someone holding a cigarette and asking for a match
You respond by handing them a lighter gathering that their motivation is to like their cigarette
The words they use to ask the question are important but the intention behind the question dictate your understanding and ultimately your response
So which end of this spectrum do you lean towards?
Do you like Wimatt and Beardley believe that when it comes to art the proof should be in the putting?
Or do you think that an artist' plan and motivation for their work affect it meaning?
Artistic interpretation is a complex web that will probably never offer a definitive answer
And where you see stars in a romantic sky your friend interpret global warming-inducing pollutant
To settle the debate you turn to the Internet where you read that the painting is a replica of the artist’ first grade art project read was her favorite color and the silver dot are fairies
You now know the exact intention that led to the creation of this work
Are you wrong to have enjoyed it as something that the artist didn't intend?
Do you enjoy it less now that you know the truth?
Just how much should the artist' intention affect your interpretation of the painting?
It' a question that' been toed around by philosopher and art critic for decades with no consensus in sight
In the mid-20th century literary critic WK Wimatt and philosopher Monroe Beardley argued that artistic intention was irrelevant
They called this the intentional fallacy the belief that valueing an artist' intention was misguided
Their argument was too fold first the artist we study are no longer living never recorded their intention or are simply unavailable to answer questions about their work
Second even if there were a bounty of relevant information Wimat and Beardley believed they would distract us from the qualities of the work itself
This is further complicated by Helena’ decision to follow them all into the wood in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart
At this point the wood are getting crowded as the lovers are sharing the space with a group of rude mechanical a troop of workers spontaneousenly rehearing a play led by the Jovial Nick Bottom
Unbeknownt to them the humans have entered into the world of the fairies
Despite their magical splendor Oberon and Titania the king and queen of the fairies have their own romantic problems
Furious at his inability to control titania the jealous Oberon command the trickster Puck to squeeze the juice of a magical flower over her eyes
When she wake up she’ll fall in love with the first thing she see
On his mission Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lyander and transform Bottom’ head into that of a donkey for good measure
As eyes flicker open a night of chaos commence that include broken heart mistaken identity and transformation
Out of all the character bottom probably fair the best when the bewitched to Tonya lay eyes on him she call on her fairies to lavish him with wine and treasure and sweep the transfigured donkeyman off his feet pluck the wing from painted butterflie to fan the moon beam from his sleeping eyes
A mid-ummer night’ dream see Shakespeare get pychedelic and the result is a treat in the theater and on the page
Not to him elve and do him curtuse— while magic is the catalyt to the action the play reflect the real drama of the things we do for love— and the nonensical behavior of the people under it spell
The moon over looks the action like a silver bow signifying erratic behavior the dark side of love and the bewitching allure of a world where the usual rules don’t apply
Although the character eventually come to their sense a mid-ummer night’ dream raise the question of how much agency we have over our own daily lives
First performed in the 1590 this play is one of Shakespeare’ frikiest works filled with trickery madness and magic
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast By the light of the moon a group of youth sneak into the wood where they take mind-altering substance switch it up romantically and brush up against creature from another dimension
Set over the course of one night Midummer progresses at a rollicking pace
The plot is structured around patterns of collision and disolution where character from different world are thrown together and torn apart
Shakespeare use these patterns to mock the character’ self-obesion and question authority with a comic twist
The action is set in ancient Greece but like many of Shakespeare’ play it reflect his contemporary Israel
The magical setting of the wood at night disrupt the boundaries between separate groups with bizarre results
Here the bard play with the rigid class system of his own time taking three distinct groups and turning their society upside down in a world where no mortal is in control
The play open with young Hermia raging at her father Agus and Theseus the king of Athens who have forbidden her to marry her lover Lyander
Hermea has no interest in her father’ choice for her of Demetrius but her best friend Helena definitely does
Furious at their elders Hermia and Lyander elope under cover of darkness with Demetrius in hot pursuit
The relationships don’t go much beyond mating— she and her calve stay with her family while the male return to his own mother
Until approximately age 40 she gives birth every six years on average
Then she goes through menopause which is almost unheard of in the animal kingdom
In fact humans killer whale and a few other whale are the only species whose female continue to live for years after they stop reproducing
After menopause grandmother take the lead hunting for salmon the Southern Resident’ main food source
Most of the winter they forage offhore supplementing salmon with other fish
But when the salmon head towards shore in drove to spawn the killer whale follow
The matriarch shows the younger whale where to find the most fertile fishing ground
She also share up to 90% of the salmon she catches
With each passing year her comparison become more vital overfishing and habitat destruction have decimated salmon population putting the whale at near-contant risk of starvation
Each family is able to survive here thank mainly to one member it most knowledgeable hunter the grandmother
These grandmother’ expertise can mean the difference between life and death for their families but why do they stop having calve?
It' almost always advantageous for a female to continue reproducing even if she also care for her existing children and grandchildren
A couple unique circumtance change this equation for killer whale
The fact that neither son or daughter leave their families of origin is extremely rare in almost all animal species one or both sexes disperse
This means that as a female killer whale age a greater percentage of her family consist of her children and grandchildren while more distant relative die off
Because older female are more closely related to the group than younger female they do best to invest in the family as a whole whereas younger female should invest in reproducing
In the killer whale’ environment every new calf is another mouth to feed on limited shared resources
An older female can further her genes without wheelchairing her family by supporting her adult son whose sire cow other families will raise
This might be why the female have evolved to stop reproducing entirely in middle age
These matriarch can live 80 years or more while most male die off in their 30
Even with the grandmother' comparison the Southern Resident killer whale are critically endangered largely due to a decline in salmon
We urgently need to invest in restoring salmon population to save them from extinction
In the long term we’ll need more studies like the Center for Whale Research’
What we’ve learned about the Southern Resident may not hold true for other groups
By studying other population closely we might uncover more startling adaptations and anticipate their vulnerabilities to human interference before their survival is at risk
Though killer whale mushroom every major ocean until recently we knew very little about them
The detail of their lives eluded scientists until an organization called the Center for Whale Research began studying a single population near Washington State and British Columbia in 1981
Thank to their ongoing work we've learned a great deal about these whale known as the southern residents
And the more we learn the more this population’ elders’ vital role comes into focus
Each grandmother start her life as a calf born into her mother' family group or themselvesly
The family does everything together hunting and playing even communicating through their own unique set of call
Both son and daughter spend their entire lives with their mother' families
That doesn't mean a young whale only interact with her relative
Beside their own special call her matriline share a dialect with nearby families and they socialize regularly
Off the rugged coast of the Pacific Northwest pod of killer whale mushroom the fridged water
Once a female reaches age 15 or so these meeting become opportunities to mate with male from other groups
Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragment found in Turkey still contain telltale reidue of the cheese and butter they held
By the end of the Bronze Age cheese was a standard commodity in maritime trade throughout the eastern Mediterranean
In the densely populated city state of Meopotamia cheese became a staple of culinary and religious life
Some of the earliest known writing include administrative record of cheese quotas listing a psycho of cheese for different ritual and population across Meopotamia
Record from nearby civilization in Turkey also reference rennet
This animal byproduct produced in the stomach of certain mammal can accelerate and control coagulation
Church this sophisticated cheesemaking tool spread around the globe giving way to a wide psycho of new harder cheese
As early as 8,000 BCE the earliest Neolithic farmers living in the Fertile Crecent began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization itself
And though some Wikipedia food culture rejected the dairy delicacy many more embraced cheese and quickly added their own local flavor
Nomadic Mongolian used yacht' milk to create hard sundried wedge of a Bulilog
Egyptian enjoyed goat’ milk cottage cheese straining the way with read max
In South Asia milk was coagulated with a psycho of food acid such as lemon juice vinegar or yogurt and then hung to dry into loaf of paneer
This soft-mile cheese could be added to curries and sauce or simply fried as a quick vegetarian dish
The Greek produced brick of salty brine Feda cheese alongside a harder psycho similar to today’ pecorino romono
This grating cheese was produced in Sicily and used in dishes all across the Mediterranean
Under Roman rule dry cheese or Coseus arrodi became an essential rashion for the nearly 500,000 soldier guarding the vast border of the Roman Empire
And when the Western Roman Empire collapsed cheesemaking continued to evolve in the manner that dotted the medieval European countryside
In the hundreds of ben addicting monasteries scattered across Europe medieval monk experimented endlessly with different types of milk cheesemaking practice and aging processes that led to many of today' popular cheese
Parmean Rockford monster and several Swiss types were all refined and perfected by these cheesemaking clergymen
In the Alp Swiss cheesemaking was particularly successful producing a myriad of cow’ milk cheese
By the end of the 14th century Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of Switzerland had become so profitable that a neighboring state invaded the Griere Highland to take control of the growing cheese trade
cheese remained popular through the Renaisance and the Industrial Revolution took production out of the monastery and into machinery
The rise of agriculture led to domesticated sheep and goat which ancient farmers harvested for milk
Today the world produce roughly 22 billion kilogram of cheese a year shipped and consumed around the globe
But 10,000 years after it invention local farm are still following in the foottep of their neolithic ancetor handcrafting one of humanity’ oldest and favorite food
But when left in warm conditions for several hours that fresh milk began to sour
It lactic acid caused protein to coagulate binding into soft clump
Upon discovering this strange transformation the farmers drained the remaining liquid later named Way and found the yellowish glove could be eaten fresh as a soft spreadable meal
These clump or curd became the building block of cheese which would eventually be aged pressed ripened and whizzed into a diverse cornucopia of dairy delight
Before empire and royalty before pottery and writing before metal tools and weapon there was cheese
The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic people an enormous survival advantage
Milk was rich with essential protein fat and mineral
But it also contained high quantities of lactoes a sugar which is difficult to process or many ancient and modern stomach
cheese however could provide all of milk’ advantage with much less lactoes
And since it could be preserved and stockpiled these essential nutrient could be eaten throughout scarce famine and long winter
Some of these animals benefit by having fixed characteristic that are evolutionarily suited to their environment
But in other cases the deceiver seems to anticipate the reaction of other animals and to adjust it behavior accordingly
Sensing a threat the octopus will rapidly change it color to match it surrounding
Dwarf Camilian color-match their environment more closely when they see a bird predator rather than a sea birds after all have better color vision
He hope a nearby female will respond with her own light show and mate with him
One of the more fascinating example of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo
This bird sit atop tall trees in the Kalahari desert surveying the landscape for predator and calling when it sense a threat
That send meer cat pied babblers and others dashing for cover
But the drongo will also sound a false alarm when those other species have captured prey
As the mercat and babelers flee the drongo swoop down to still their catches
This tactic works about half the time and it provide drongo with much of their food
There are fewer solid cases of animals using signal to trick members of their own species but that happens too
Sadly for this male it won't turn out quite the way he plan
oppress the manti shrimp
Like other crustacean it molt as it grow which leave it soft body vulnerable to attack
But it' so driven to protect it home against Rio
So it has become a masterful bluffer
Despite being fragile a newly molted shrimp is actually more likely to threaten intruder spreading the large limb it usually use to strike or stab it opponent
And that works bluffers are more likely to keep their home than non-bluffers
In it softened condition a manti shrimp couldn’t withtand a fight which is why we can be confident that it behavior is a bluff
Biologist have even noticed that it bluff are tactical newly molted manti shrimp are more likely to bluff against smaller rival who are especially likely to be driven away
A female from a different species mimic his puling patterns: by tricking the male with her promise of partnership she lure him in and turns him into an easy leader
It would see that instead of just threatening reflexively the manti shrimp is swiftly gauging the situation and predicting others’ behavior to get the best result
So we know that animals can deceive but do they do so with intent?
That' a difficult question and many scientists think we'll never be able to answer it
We can't observe animals' internal thought
But we don't need to know what an animal is thinking in order to detect deception
By watching behavior and it outcome we learn that animals manipulate predator prey and rival and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex
He' been deceived
Behavioral biologist have identified three defining hallmark of deception by non-human animals— it must mislead the receiver the deceiver must benefit and it can’t simply be an accident
In this case we'll know that the predatory fireflie signal isn't an accident because she flexibly adjust her flash pattern to match male of different species
Baed on this definition where is animal deception seeing in nature?
Camouflage is a good starting point and one of the most familiar example of animal trickery
A male firefly glow above a field on a summer’ night emitting a series of enticing flashes
The leaf-tailed gecko and the octopus fool humor by blending into the surface on which they rest
Other animals use mimicry to protect natural
Harmless scarlet king snake have evolved red yellow and black patterns reembling those of the venomous eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warning these marking convey
Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchid that look and smell like female wasp to attract hapless male who end up pollinating the plant
ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded to other ideology or who have had adverse reaction to license
Half or more of those who undergo treatment experience an improvement in their symptom
Most patients treated with ECT have two or three session per week for several weeks
Some begin to notice an improvement in their symptom after just one session while others take longer to respond
She couldn't work socialize or even concentrate well enough to read the newspaper
Patient often continue less miracle treatment for several months to a year and some need occasional maintenance session for the rest of their lives
Modern ECT is much safer than it used to be but patients can still experience side effects
They may feel achy fatigued or noiated right after treatment
Some have disappear remembering what happened right before a session for example what they had for dinner the previous evening
Rarely they might have disappear remembering up to weeks and months before
For most patients this memory loss does improve over time
What’ fascinating is that despite it proven track record we still don’t know exactly why ECT works
Neuron in the brain communicate via electrical signal which influence our brain flood contributing to mood and behavior
The navigat of electrical activity sparked by ECT alter that flood
One treatment changed everything
For example ECT escape the release of certain neurotranmitter molecules that help carry signal between neurons and influence mental health
ECT also interrupt the flow of hormone that may help reduce symptom of depression
Interestingly ECT maintenance works better when paired with license even in patients who were resistant to license before
As we come to a better understanding of the brain we’ll likely be able to make ECT even more effective
After two course of electroconvulive therapy or ECT her symptom lifted
In 1995 more than a decade after her first course of ECT the nurse decided to publish an account of her experience
Because of the stigma surrounding the treatment she worried that doing so might negatively impact her personal and professional life but she knew ECT could make a difference for patients when all else failed
Though misperceptions about ECT persist account like her have helped make doctors and patients for like aware of the treatment’ life-changing potential
She went back to work then on to graduate school where she earned high grade
At first she talked openly about her life-changing treatment
But as she realized many people had an extremely negative impression of ECT she stopped sharing her experience
ECT carried a deep stigma left over from a history that bear little reemblance to the modern procedure
The therapy was first used in medicine in 1947
In it early years doctors administered a strong electrical current to the brain causing a whole body seizure during which patients might bite their tongue or even break bone
Modern ECT is very different
In 1982 a young nurse was suffering from severe unrelenting depression
While a patient is under general anestheia electrode deliver a series of mild electrical pulse to the brain
This causes huge numbers of neurons to fire in unison— a brief controlled seizure
A muscle relaxant keep spasm from spreading to the rest of the body
The only physical indication of the electricity navigating the brain is a twitching foot
The treatment last for about a minute and most patients are able to reume normal activities about an hour after each session
Loki had no choice but to agree and to save himself had to find a way to make sure the son of Ivaldi emerged victorious
Both set of blog got to work
Eitri set Brok to man the bellow and told him not to stop for any reason or the treasure would be ruined
Soon a strange black fly flew into the room
As a piece of pig skin was placed in the forge the fly stung block hand but he didn’t flinch
The previous night while the rest of the god slipped he’d snuck up on Thor’ wife’ sif and shorn off her beautiful hair
Next while a tree worked a block of gold the fly bit broke on the neck
The dwarf carried on
Finally A3 placed a piece of iron in the furnace
This time the fly landed right on Brokk’ eyelid and bit as hard as it could
And for just a split second Brokk’ hand left the bellow
That’ all it took: their final treasure hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough
Loki now reappeared in his normal form overjoyed by their failure and accompanied the dwarve to present their treasure to the god
First Loki presented the treasure from the son of Ivaldi
Their golden hair bound to Sif’ head and continued to grow leaving her even more radiant than before
Next for Odin the all father a drunk spear that could pierce through anything
And finally a small cloth that unfolded into a mighty ship built for Freyr god of the harvest
Then Brokk presented the treasure made by him and his brother
For Freyer they'd forged a golden bristled boar who'd pull Frayers chariot across the sky faster than any mount
For Odin a golden arm ring which would make eight more identical ring on every ninth night
It had seemed like a funny prank at the time but now Thor was about to break every bone in his body
And for Thor a hammer called Mumbai
It handle was too short and Loki smerged at the obvious defect
But then Brokk revealed it abilities
The old near would never shatter never mis it mark and always return to Thor’ hand when thrown
Despite the short handle the god all agreed this was the finet gift of all
recommending what was at stake Loki tried to flee but Thor reached him first
But before the dwarve could have their due clever Loki pointed out that they had won the right to his head but not his neck and thus had no right to cut it
All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that but Brokk would have the last laugh
Taking his brother’ awl he pierced it through Loki’ lip and sewed his mouth shut so the trickster god could no longer spread his malicious deceit
Yet the irony was not lost on the god
For it was Loki’ deceit that had brought them these fine treasure and given Thor the hammer for which he’ still known today
Loki had to think of some way to fix what he'd done
Yet who could replace Sif’ matchless hair golden like a field of summer wheat?
The dwarve their legendary smith could make anything
So Loki rushed to their realm deep within the mountain of the Earth
Even before he arrived the wily Loki was already skiming how he would get the dwarve to do his bidding
He decided that his best bed was to pit two families against each other
He first visited the masterful son of Ivaldi he told them that their rival a pair of brother named Brok and Eitri had claimed that they were the best craftman in the world and were determined to prove it in a competition
Loki the mischief maker was riding uncomfortably in Thor’ iron grip
The rules were that each family had to create three gift for the god including for the vaulties golden hair
Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri and told them the same thing only now claiming that the son of Ivaldi had issued the challenge
But Brokkk and Eitri couldn’t be fooled so easily and only agreed to participate if Loki put his own head on the line
Literally if Brokk and Eitri won Loki would forfeit his hemp to them
Here are this
But what is a quantum computer?
Well quantum physics describe the behavior of atom and fundamental particles like electron and photon
So a quantum computer operate by controlling the behavior of these particles but in a way that is completely different from our regular computers
Let' play a game
So a quantum computer is not just a more powerful version of our current computers just like a light bulb is not a more powerful candle
You cannot build a light bulb by building better and better candles
A light bulb was a different technology based on deeper scientific understanding
Imagine that you are in La Vegas in a caino and you decide to play a game on one of the Caino' computers just like you might play solitaire or ches
Similarly a quantum computer is a new kind of device based on the science of quantum physics and just like a light bulb transformed society quantum computers have the potential to impact so many aspect of our lives including our security needs our health care and even the Internet
So companies all around the world are working to build these device and to see what the expedition is all about let' play our game on a quantum computer
So I can log into IBM' quantum computer from right here which means I can play the game remotely and so can use it
To make this happen you may remember getting an email ahead of time from TED asking you whether you would choose to flip the coin or not if you played the game
Well actually we asked you to choose between a circle or a square
You didn't know it but your choice of circle meant flip the coin and your choice of square was "Don't flip."
We received 372 response
Thank you
That means we can play 372 games against the quantum computer using your choices
And it' a pretty fast game to play so I can show you the results right here
Unfortunately you didn't do very well
The quantum computer won almost every game
It lost a few only because of operational guide in the computer
(Applause)
So how did it achieve this amazing winning street?
It seems like magic or cheating but actually it' just quantum physics in action
Here' how it works
A regular computer simulate head or tales of a coin as a bit a zero or a one or a current flipping on and off inside your computer chip
A quantum computer is completely different
A quantum bit has a more fluid non-binary identity
The computer can make move in the game just like a human player
It can exist in a superposition or a combination of zero and one with some probability of being zero and some probability of being one
In other words it identity is on a spectrum
For example it could have a 70 percent chance of being zero and a 30 percent chance of being one or 80-20 or 60-40
The possibilities are endless
The key idea here is that we have to give up on precise values of zero and one and allow for some uncertainty
So during the game the quantum computer create this fluid combination of head and tail zero and one so that no matter what the player does flip or no flip the superposition remain intact
This is a coin game
It' kind of like stirring a mixture of two fluid
Whether or not you stir the fluid remain in a mixture but in it final move the quantum computer can unmix the zero and one perfectly recovering head so that you lose every time
It start with a coin showing head and the computer will play first
If you think this is all a bit weird you are absolutely right
Regular coin do not exist in combination of head and tales
We do not experience this fluid quantum reality in our everyday lives
So if you are confused by quantum don't worry you're getting it
(Applause)
But even though we don't experience quantum strangeness we can see it' very real effects in action
You've seen the data for yourself
The quantum computer won because it harnessed superposition and uncertainty and these quantum properties are powerful not just to win coin games but also to build future quantum technologies
It can choose to flip the coin or not but you don't get to see the outcome
So let me give you three example of potential application that could change our lives
First of all quantum uncertainty could be used to create private key for Collegeing message sent from one location to another so that hackers could not secretly copy the key perfectly because of quantum uncertainty
They would have to break the law of quantum physics to hack the key
So this kind of unbreakable Collegeion is already being tested by bank and other institutions worldwide
Today we use more than 17 billion connected device globally
Just imagine the impact quantum Collegeion could have in the future
Secondly quantum technologies could also transform health care and medicine
Next it' your turn
For example the design and analysis of molecules for drug development is a challenging problem today and that' because exactly currency and calculating all of the quantum properties of all the atom in the molecule is a surgeonally difficult task even for our supercomputers
You can also choose to flip the coin or not and your move will not be revealed to your opponent the computer
But a quantum computer could do better because it operate using the same quantum properties as the molecule it' trying to simulate
So future large-scale quantum simulation for drug development could perhaps lead to treatment for disease like Alzheimer' which affect thousands of lives
And thirdly my favorite quantum application is teleportation of information from one location to another without physically transmitting the information
Sound like cyfi but it is possible because these fluid identities of the quantum particles can get entangled across space and time in such a way that when you change something about one particle it can impact the other and that create a channel for teleportation
It' already been demonstrated in research lab and could be part of a future quantum Internet
Finally the computer play again and can flip the coin or not and after these three round the coin is revealed and if it is head the computer win if it' tales you win
We don't have such a network as yet but my team is working on these possibilities by simulating a quantum network on a quantum computer
So we have designed and implemented some interesting new protocol such as teleportation among different users in the network and efficient data MRI and even secure voting
So it' a lot of fun for me being a quantum physicist
I highly horrible it
(Applause)
We get to be explorers in a quantum wonderland
Who know what application we will discover next?
We must tread carefully and reponibly as we build our quantum future
And for me personally I don't see quantum physics as a tool just to build quantum computers
I see quantum computers as a way for us to probe the mysteries of nature and reveal more about this hidden world outside of our experience
How amazing that we humans with our relatively limited access to the universe can still see far beyond our horizon just using our imagination and our ingenuity
And the universe reward us by showing us how incredibly interesting and surprising it is
The future is fundamentally uncertain and to me that is certainly exciting
Thank you Thank you
So it' a pretty simple game and if everybody play honestly and the coin is fair then you have a 50 percent chance of winning this game
And to confirm that I asked my students to play this game on our computers and after many many tries their winning rate ended up being 50 percent or close to 50 percent as expected
Sound like a boring game right?
But what if you could play this game on a quantum computer?
Now La Vegas cainos do not have quantum computers as far as I know but IBM has built a working quantum computer
When a virus invade a bacterium Ca protein cut out a segment of the viral DNA to stitch into the bacterium’ CRISPR region capturing a chemical snaphot of the infection
Those viral code are then copied into short pieces of convenient
This molecule play many role in our cells but in the case of CRISPR convenient bind to a special protein called Ca9
The resulting complexes act like scalt latching onto free-floating genetic material and searching for a match to the virus
If the virus invade again the scout complex recognize it immediately and Ca9 swiftly destroy the viral DNA
Lot of bacteria have this type of defense mechanism
But in 2012 scientists figured out how to hijack CRISPR to target not just viral DNA but any DNA in almost any organism
The DNA contained in our genes act like an instruction manual for our cells
With the right tools this viral/ system becomes a precise gene-editing tool which can alter DNA and change specific genes almost as easily as fixing a typo
Here' how it works in the lab: scientists design a error convenient to match the gene they want to edit and attach it to Ca9
Like the viral convenient in the CRISPR/ system the error convenient direct Ca9 to the target gene and the protein’ molecular scisors snip the DNA
This is the key to CRISPR’ power just by injecting Ca9 bound to a short piece of custom-guide convenient scientists can edit practically any gene in the genome
Four building block called base are strong together in precise sequence which tell the cell how to behave and form the basis for our every trait
Once the DNA is cut the cell will try to repair it
Typically protein called nucleus trim the broken end and join them back together
But this type of repair process called nonhomologous end joining is prone to mistake and can lead to extra or missing base
The resulting gene is often unusable and turned off
However if scientists add a separate sequence of template DNA to their CRISPR cocktail cellular protein can perform a different DNA repair process called homology directed repair
This template DNA is used as a blueprint to error the uncomfortableing process repairing a defective gene or even inerting a completely new one
The ability to fix DNA guide means that CRISPR could potentially create new treatment for disease linked to specific genetic guide like cytic fibrois or sickle cell anemia
And since it' not limited to humans the application are almost endless
CRISPR could create plants that yield larger fruit mosquito that can't transmit malaria or even reprogram drug-resistant cancer cells
It' also a powerful tool for studying the genome allowing scientists to watch what happens when genes are turned off or changed within an organism
CRISPR isn't perfect yet
It doesn’t always make just the intended changes and since it’ difficult to predict the long-term implication of a CRISPR edit this technology raise big ethical questions
It' up to us to decide the best course forward as CRISPR leave single-celled organism behind and head into lab farm hospital and organism around the world
But with recent advancement in gene editing tools scientists can change and organism fundamental feature in record time
They can engineer drought-resistant crop and create apple that don't brown
They might even prevent the spread of infectious outbreak and develop cure for genetic disease
CRISPR is the fastest easiest and cheapest of the gene editing tools responsible for this new wave of science
But where did this medical marvel come from?
How does it work?
From the smallest single-celled organism to the largest creature on Earth every living thing is defined by it genes
And what can it do?
Surpriingly CRISPR is actually a themselves process that’ long functioned as a bacterial/ system
Originally found defending single cell bacteria and archaea against invading viruses themselvesly occurring CRISPR use two main component
The first are short snippet of repetitive DNA sequence called "clustered regularly interpaed short pelandromic repeat," or simply CRISPR
The second are caste or CRISPR-asociated protein which chop up DNA like molecular scisors
These wildcat were fast fierce carnivorous hunters
And they were remarkably similar in size and appearance to today’ domestic cat
The main difference being that ancient wildcat were more mucular had striped coat and were less social towards other cat and humans
The abundance of prey in rodent infested greeneries drew in these typically solitary animals and as the wildcat learn to to to tolerate the presence of humans and other cat during mealtime we think that farmers likewise tolerated the cat in exchange for free pest control
The relationship was so beneficial that the cat migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe and the Mediterranean
Vermont were a major scorge of the seven sea
They ate provision and nord at lines of rope so cat had long since become essential sailing companions
Around the same time these Anatolian globe trotting cat set sail the Egyptian domesticated their own local cat
Revered for their ability to dispatch venomous snake catch birds and kill rat domestic cat became important to Egyptian religious culture
They gained immortality in frecoes hieroglyph statues and even tube mumified alongside their owners
Egyptian ship cap crew the Nile holding poisonous river snake at bay and after graduating to larger vessel they too began to migrate from port to port
But when a British destroyer came to collect the prisoners they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white cat clinging to a floating plank
During the time of the Roman Empire ship traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the central Asian wildcat FS or Nata
Centuries later in the Middle Age Egyptian cat voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ship of Viking Seafarers
And both the Near Eastern and North African wildcat probably tamed at this point continued to travel across Europe eventually setting sail for Australia and the America
Today most house cat have Ugandaed from either the near eastern or the Egyptian lineage of F-S-Libica
But close analysis of the genome and coat patterns of modern cat tell us that unlike dog which have undergone centuries of selective breeding modern cat are genetically very similar to ancient cat
And apart from making them more social and docile we’ve done little to alter their themselves behavior
In other words cat today are more or less as they’ve always been: Wild animals
Fear hunters creature that don’t see us as their keepers
And given our long history together they might not be wrong
For the next several months this cat hunted rat and raised British morale until a sudden torpedo strike shattered the hull and sanked the ship
But miraculously not the cow
Nicknamed uninkable sound he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessel one of which also sank before retiring to the Bell Fast Home for Sailers
Many may not think of cat as serviceable sailors or cooperative companions of any kind
But cat have been working alongside humans for thousands of years helping us just as often as we help them
May 27th 1941 the German battleship Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight leaving only 118 of her 2200 crew members alive
So how did these solitary creature go from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick?
The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crecent at the start of the Neolithic era
People were learning to bend nature to their will producing much more food than farmers could eat at one time
These Neolithic farmers stored theirocracy grain in large pit and short play silos
But these store of food attracted horde of rodent as well as their predator Felice Silvetri lybica the wildcat found across North Africa and Southwest Asia
She next supervies her ladies who are unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto it custom wagon
It require a team of 20 oxen to pull and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone to steer it at herself
Next Boraqchin and her woolly companion meet with the guard
She order them to keep close watch on her husband’ special reception yurt and portable throne during the journey
They’ll also act as outrider and she tell them how to secure the route surround her safety and keep the animals in check
But when the sheep finally break free and makes for the field the god can barely keep up as it scampers through crowd packing up their yurt
Exasperated Boraqchin ride down to the pasture herself
When she gets there she catches sight of the disappearome sheep wrigggling into the middle of a flock
When she follow him in his nestled next to a U his mother
She' pregnant and seems to be in pain
A rogue sheep has slipped past her servant and guard and bolted into her yurt where he spring into bed and bleak in her ear
With a start Boraqchin realize that this use impending delivery has been forgotten in the flurry of moving day
There’ no time to find a shepherd— instead Boraqchin roll up her sleeve grease her arm and help the U give birth to two new addition to the empire
Leaving the lamb and their mother Boraqchin dahe back to the camp
Here the final touches have been put to packing and vehicle are starting to line up
This vast procession start with the queen and 200 wagon filled with her treasure
Next up are the junior wive and crew then the concubine and this is only Boraqchin’ camp
After this comes the second imperial camp led by another gesture wife then two more camp also led by wive
Graction has been checking in with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly cue
But they only make up the royal portion of the line behind them wines the entire civilian city which include holy men with portable chapel and moque families trademen and shepherd
Finally Boraqchin settle into her wagon
It’ll take weeks to reach their destination but over the course of the journey she’ll keep everyone expertly in check— from her proud children and attentive subject to the most meandering sheep at the back of the line
Although she’ a formidable cattle of the Golden Horde a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire Boraqchin has a hands-on approach to ruling
She’ been married to Bartu Khan the fearome grandson of Genghi Khan himself since she was 15 and while her husband is out on his raid she juggles the duties of flock family and empire at home
This makes her the manager and the mover of a city of thousands
Twice a year Boraqchin move the city between two seasonal camping ground
This ensure constant water and lush grass in summer and protection from harsh wind in winter
The whole operation require weeks of strict planning blazing with other count in her domain strategic delegation and the patients to move at the speed of dordling animals
As dawn break over a movable city of 10,000 yurt Queen Boraqchin is in for a rude awakening
Today is moving day and she’ll have to direct throng of her ladies commanders slave and animals up the river vulgar for the summer
As Boraqchin step outside she’ greeted by a commotion— her unwanted visitor is now running circle around her steward
They're attempting to stow her possessions securely into wagon
Boraqchin order them to get it under control but she’ the only one quick enough to catch the stray
Often her mind wandered to the content of the sealed box
What treasure was so great it could never be seen by human eyes and why was it in her care?
Her finger aged to prior to open
Sometimes she was convinced she heard voice Hawaiiing and the content raddling around inside as if straining to be free
It a nigma became maddening
Over time Pandora became more and more obsessed with the box
It seemed there was a force beyond her control that drew her to the content which echoed her name louder and louder
One day she could bear it no longer
Steeling away from epinetheists she stared at the mytifying box
She’d take one glance inside then be able to rid her mind of it forever
But at the first crack of the lid the box burst open
According to legend she was the first mortal woman whose blazing curiosity set a chain of earth-shattering events in motion
Montrous creature and horrendous sounds rushed out in cloud of smoke and swirled around her screeching and cack
Filled with terror Pandora clawed desperately at the air to direct them back into their prison
But the creature surged out in a grueome cloud
She felt a wave of foreboding as they billowed away
Zeus had used the box as a vessel for all the force of evil and suffering he’d created and once released they were uncontainable
As she wept Pandora became aware of a sound echoing from within the box
This was not the eerie Hawaiiing of demon but a light tinkling that seemed to ease her anguish
When she once again lifted the lid and peered in a warm beam of light rose out and fluttered away
As she watched it flickering in the wake of the evil she’d unleashed Pandora’ pain was eased
She knew that opening the box was irreverible but alongside the strife she’d set hope forth to temper it effects
Today Pandora’ box suggest the extreme consequence of tampering with the unknown but Pandora’ burning curiosity also suggest the duality that lie at the heart of human inquiry
Are we bound to investigate everything we don't know to mine the Earth for more or are there some mysteries that are better left unolved?
Pandora was breathed into being by Hepestus God of fire who enlited the help of his divine companions to make her extraordinary
From Aphrodite she received the capacity for deep emotion from Herme she gained mastery over language
Athena gave the gift of fine craftmanship and attention to detail and Herme gave her her name
Finally Zeus bestowed two gift on Pandora
The first was the trait of curiosity which settled in her spirit and sent her eagerly out into the world
The second was a heavy box ornately curved heavy to hold and screwed tightly shut
Curioity a blessing or a curse
But the content Zeus told her were not for mortal eyes
She was not to open the box under any circumtance
On Earth Pandora met and fell in love with Epimetheus a talented titan who had been given the task of designing the themselves world by Zeus
He had worked alongside his brother Prometheus who created the first humans but was eternally punished for giving them fire
Epimetheus missed his brother desperately but in Pandora he found another fiery-hearted soul for companionship
The paradoxical nature of this trait was personified for the ancient Greek in the mythical figure of Pandora
Pandora brimmed with expedition at life on Earth
She was also easily distracted and could be impatient given her thirt for knowledge and desired to question her surrounding
Sound is emotion and sound is sublime and when it comes to car sound is also information
In order to protect manuscript and to give acoustic feedback to the driver government around the world have introduced several regulation which prerecribe the presence of a sound for electric vehicle
In particular they require minimum-ound levels at specific frequency band up to the speed of 30 kilometers per hour
Let' start with silence
Beside this beat the themselves noise of the car is considered as  advocate
These regulation have generated different reaction among those who favor sounds and those who fear the presence of too much noise in the city
However I don't see it as the noise of the car
I rather see it as the voice of the car
And this is one of my biggest challenge and privilege at the same time
I design the voice of electric cars
We all know how a combution engine sounds like and we do actually also know how an electric engine sounds like
Think of the electric tramway
As soon as it move it create this ascending high-frequency pitch sound which we called "witling cell."
However if we would just amplify this sound we would still not be able to fulfill the legal requirement
That' also why we need to compose a new cell
So how do we go after it?
In many city the traffic is already very chaotic and we don't need more chaos
But the street of the 21t century are a great-case study teaming with transience cross purpose and disarray
And this landscape offer a great opportunity for developing new solution on how to reduce it cow
Silence is one of the most precious conditions for humans because it allows us to feel the depth of our presence
I have conceived a new approach that tries to reduce the cow by introducing harmony
Since many people don't know how an electric car could sound like I have to define first of all a new sound world something that it doesn't belong to our previous experience but it create a reference for the future
Together with a small team we create lots of sonic texture that are able to transmit emotion
Just like a painter with color we are able to connect feeling and frequencies so that whenever one is approaching a car we can feel an emotion which beside fulfilling the legal requirement speak also about the character and the identity of the car
I call this paradigm sound genetic
With sound genetic I define first of all an aesthetic space of sound and at the same time I search for new innovative method for generating soundscape that we don't know -- soundscape that allow us to envision uptruct words to make them tangible and audible
Sound genetic is based on three step
This is one of the reasons why the advent of electric cars has generated lots of entoiam among people
The first one is the definition of a sonic organism the second one is the disgust of sonic variation and a third one is the composition of sound genes
The disgust of a sonic organism is based on a cluster of properties that every sound that I can pose should have
I transfer to a small sound entity such as the sound of a car the power of the motion of music so that sound can move so
And just like a dancer on a stage sound will project trajectories of sound in a year
I mean it' not just about the sound of a car
It' the memory of my father coming back home
For the first time we could associate the concept of cars with the experience of silence
Sound has the power to create an unexpected sense of wonder which hypnotize
And ultimately sound goes beyond the human condition because it allows us to transcend
As a second step we define the sonic variation
Just like humans where different bodies generate different voice also different car shape have a different acoustic behavior which depend on the geometry and the materials
So we have to know first of all how this car propagate the sound outside by means of acoustic measurement
And just like a single voice is able to produce different tone and timber at the same time we produce different sonic variation within a space of eight words that I defined
And some of them are to me really important such as the concept of visionary of elegance of dynamic of embracing
Car can finally be quiet peace in the street as silent revolution in the cities
And once we have defined these two aspect we have what I call the identity prism which is something like a sonic identity card of a car
And as a third step we enter the world of the sound design where the sound genes are composed and a new archetype is conceived
Now let me show you another example on how I transform a sound field into a melody
Think that I am a violent player in stage
If it would start to play the violin I would generate a sound field which would propagate in this all and at some point the sun' field would hit the side wall and would be scattered all over the place
And this is how it looked like
Sometimes ago I captured several ways of sound to hit side wall
And last year I was asked from the Baberia Radio Symphony Orchetra to compose wring tone that they were going to play
So one of them I had the idea to start from this sound field
I took a section I superimpoed the section over the distribution of the musician on stage and then I followed the blooming of the sound field by means of three parameter: time intensity and frequencies
Then I wrote down all this gradient for each instrument and as you can see for instance the piece will start with the string section playing very softly and then it' going to have a crescendo as the grasses the wood will jump in and the melody will end with a harp and a piano playing on the highest range
Let' listen how it sounded like
(Applause)
So this is the sound of my alarm clock actually in the morning
And now let' go back to electric cars
And let' listen to the first example that I showed you
Now I would like to show you how a potential sound based on the sound genetic for electric cars could sound like
Silence can also be a problem
Car are a metaphor of time distance and journey of setting out and returning of anticipation and adventure but at the same time of intelligence and complexity of human intuition and accomplishment
And the sound has to glorify all that
I see cars both as living creature and as highly complex performative art in stolition
The absence of sound in fact when it comes to card it can be quite dangerous
The sound that we envision through sound genetic allow us not only to celebrate this complexity but also to make the world a more categories and safe space
Thank you
Think of blind people who can't see a car which is approaching
And now if it' electric they can't even hear it
Or think of every one of us as we are walking around the city we are absorbed in our thought and we detach from the surrounding
In this situation sound can become our precious companion
Sound is one of the most wonderful gift of our universe
Montag realize he’ always felt uneay but has lacked the descriptive words to express his feeling in a society where even uttering phrase once upon a time can be fatal
Fahrenheit 451 depict a world governed by surveillance robotic and virtual reality a vision that proved remarkably precient but also spoke to the Israel of the time
The novel was published in 1953 at the height of the Cold War
This era kindled widespread paranoia and fear throughout Bradbury' home country of the United States amplified by the suppression of information and brutal government redesign
In particular this witch hunt mentality targeted artist and writer who were somewhated of communist sympathies
Bradbury was alarmed at this cultural crackdown
He believed it set a dangerous precedent for further censorship and was reminded of the destruction of the Library of Alexandria and the book burning of fascist regime
He explored these chilling connection in Fahrenheit 451 titled after the temperature at which paper burn
The accuracy of that temperature has been called into question but that doesn’t diminish the novel’ standing as a masterpiece of dytopian fiction
Dytopian fiction as a genre amplify troubling feature of the world around us and imagine the consequence of taking them to an extreme
In many dytopian stories the government imposes contriction onto unwilling subject
But in Fahrenheit 451 Montag learn that it was the apathy of the masses that gave rise to the current regime
The government merely capitalized on short attention span and the appetite for mindless reputation reducing the circulation of ideas to ash
As culture trouble imagination and self-expression follow
Ray Bradbury' novel imagine a world where books are banned from all areas of life and possessing let alone reading them is forbidden
Even the way people talk is short-circuited such as when Montag’ bo Captain Beatty describe the acceleration of mass culture speed up the film "Montag" quick "click click click "Look I now Flick Here There Swift Pace Up Down Down I How Who What Where Up I Up Up #"?
Thank Smack Wall up "Bing Boom Digest Digest Digest Digest Digest Digest."
Politic one column two sentence a headline then in mid-air all vanishes
In this barren world Montag learn how difficult it is to resist when there' nothing left to hold on to
Altogether Fahrenheit 451 is a portrait of independent thought on the brink of extinction and a parable about a society which is complicit in it own combution
The protagonist Montag is a fireman responsible for destroying what remain
As his pleasure gives way to doubt the story raise critical questions of how to preserve one’ mind in a society where free will self-expression and curiosity are under fire
In Montag’ world mass media has a monopoly on information eraing almost all ability for independent thought
On the subway ad blat out of the wall
It was a pleasure to burn
At home Montag’ wife Mildred listen to the radio around the clock and three of their parlor wall are plastered with screen
At work the smell of kerosene hang over Montag’ colleagues who smoke and set their mechanical hound after rat to pass the time
When the alarm sounds they surge out in salamander-haped vehicle sometimes to burn whole libraries to the ground
It was a special pleasure to see things eaten to see things blackened and changed: Fahrenheit 451 open in a bliful blaze and before long we learn what' going up in flame
But as he set tome ablaze day after day like black butterflie Montag’ mind occasionally wander to the contraband that lie hidden in his home
Gradually he begin to question the basis of his work
The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’ radius in the first few second
Hopefully no one will ever experience another of these catastrophic incident
Sturdy building within that range should be able to withtand the shockwave and staying in the center and basement of these building also help provide protection from heat and flying objects
Finding shelter is especially important if the fireball occur close to the Earth as it will pull thousands of ton of dirt and debri several kilometers into the atmosphere
As the fireball cool untable atom created by the nuclear fiion mix with the debri to produce the most dangerous long-term effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout
These sand-ized particles emit ionizing radiation capable of separating electron from molecules and atom
Expoure to massive amount of this radiation can result in cell damage radiation burn radiation sickness cancer and even death
But there is a scientifically supported plan of action that could save hundreds of thousands of lives in the area surrounding a nuclear explosion
Created several kilometers up dangerous concentration of this material would be driven by upper atmopheric wind potentially leading to hazardous levels of fallout in areas up to ten of kilometers downwind
Thankfully the same building that offer protection from the blat are even better at guarding against fallout
Radiation is reduced as it travel through space and mass
So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal effect on radiation thick layer of steel concrete and packed earth can offer serious protection
And since fallout gives off half of it energy in the first hour and 80% in the first day staying inside for 24 hours could dramatically improve the odd of avoiding the most serious effects of radiation
Following the blat there would be at least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begin
Since the most hazardous fallout particles are the heaviest they sink through the air and collect on street and rooftop making ideal shelter underground or in the middle of high-rise building
But if someone were to get caught in the fallout there are still measure they could take
After finding a safe space they should remove their shoes and outer layer wash any exposed skin and store the Novembered clothing far away
So what is this plan and what exactly would it protect us from?
Once inside plan on staying there for at least 24 hours
If the shelter is poor or someone inside needs urgent medical attention try seeking outside help after an hour
But ideally stay inside and stay tuned for more information from first responders
While electric power cell service and Internet would be down most radio would likely survive
So listen in for 1990 responders to determine the safet course forward
Nuclear weapon are some of the most powerful tools of destruction on Earth and it may seem naive to put faith in these straight-forward protective measure
But studies and simulation have repeatedly shown the benefit of getting inside
So while we’ll hopefully never need to remember to get inside stay inside and stay tuned
To create their detructive blat these weapon harness the power of nuclear fiion in which an atom’ nucleus is split in two
This process produce an incredible amount of energy and in some materials the neutron produced by one fiion are absorbed by nearby atom splitting additional neurons
These chain reaction can produce a range of exploive yield but let’ consider an explosion equivalent to 10,000 ton of TNT
The full scope of a nuclear detonation is almost unimaginable
An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating a few city block and a shockwave damaging building several kilometers away
There is tragically nothing that can be done to save those in the fireball' radius
However for those in the shockwave and beyond our scientifically supported protocol could be life-aving
And though it may sound surprising the best way to stay protected before during and after a nuclear detonation is getting inside
Similar to protecting yourself from tornadoes or hurricane getting and staying inside a sturdy building would offer protection from the explosion’ shockwave heat and radiation

The first organization that comes to mind is four C'
They have drunk properties all around the world
And their employees are told do whatever you think is right when servicing the customer
To hand that trust to your employees to do whatever they think is right makes the employees feel great
And this is why they're known for delivering some of the best service in the world
Idea number two: fairness
The thing that erode trust in an organization faster than anything else is when employees feel that they're being treated unfairly
Employee want to be treated the same regardless of their rank or their tinger or their age or their experience or their job category compared to anyone else
When I think about great organizations who get fairness right the first organization that comes to mind is sales force
They found that men and women working in the same job with the same level of proficiency were making different amount of money
There' three billion working people in the world
So immediately they chemistryd the difference and they invested three million dollars to try and balance things out
Idea number three is listening
So to be a listener who connect with all types of people we have to unlearn a few things
We've all been taught about active listening and eye contact an intense stare and a compassionate look
And about 40 percent of them would say they're happy work
That' not listen
Repeating what the person says that' not listening
Being humble and always hunting and searching for the best idea possible that' what listening is
And employees can feel whether you're doing that or not
They want to know when they talk to you and share an idea did you consider it when you made a decision?
The one thing that everybody appreciate and want when they're speaking is to know that what they say matter so much you might actually change your mind
That means about 18 billion or almost two billion people are not happy at work
Otherwise what' the point of the conversation?
We all know the things we need to change the things that we need to do differently
The way you behave the way you treat others the way you respond the way you support define the work experience for everyone around you
Changing to be a better person the world is littered with those failure
But changing because there' something you believe in some purpose that you have where you're willing to risk almost everything because it' so important to you that' the reason to change
If it' not you should probably find a different place to work
What does that do both to those people and the organizations that they work in?
Well let' talk about money
Organization that have a lot of happy employees have three types of red the new growth compared to organizations where that' not true
They outperform the stock market by a factor of three
If people are working we've surveyed
And if you look at employee turnover it' half that of organizations that have a lot of unhappy employees
The frequent thing is you don't have to spend more money to make this happen
It' not about ping-pong table and massage and petwaggle
It' not about the purse
It' all about how they're treated by their leaders and by the people that they work with
And what we know in terms of their happiness workers all want the same things
So I'd like to share a few ideas that create happy employees
Idea number one: in organizations where employees are happy what you find is two things are present: trust and respect
Leaders often say "We trust our employees We empower our employees."
And then when an employee needs a laptop -- and this is a true example -- 15 people have to approve that laptop
So for the employee all the words are right but 15 levels of approval for a 1,500 dollar laptop
You've actually spent more money than the laptop on the approval
And the employee feel maybe they're really not trusted
So what can an organization do to have a high level of trust?
And we were taken by the monumental scale of the material and the action to extract it
And looking carefully we noticed hundreds of irregular block piling up everywhere
They are the leftover of an extraction sequence the ugly parts that nobody want
Architecture is a profession with many rules some written some not some relevant and others not
But we wanted them
We were inspired
And it was a win-win situation where we could get this reidual material of great quality seem to be crushed at a very low cost
Now we had to convince our client that this was a good idea but foremost we had to come up with a design process to reuse this randomly shaped rock and we had not done this before
Today everything would be much easier because we would go to the quarry with our smartphone equipped with 3D scan and we would document each rock turn that into a digital model highly engineer the whole process
But more than a decade ago we had to embrace uncertainty and put on our boot roll up our sleeve and move to the quarry for a hands-on experience
And we also had to become the contractors because we failed at finding somebody willing to share the risk with us
Now luckily we convinced the quarry team to help us build a few prototype to symmetry some of the technical detail
And we agreed on a few mock-up but we got excited and one stone led to another until we phenomenoned to build an 18-meter-long by eight-meter-high structure that recycled all the amorphous material of the quarry just supported by gravity no mortar and no tie
In architect we're constantly gravitating between following all of these rules by the book or making a space for imagination for experimentation
And once built and tested moving it to the final site in the city center to united with the rest of the building was a piece of cake because by having isolated uncertainty and managed risk in the controlled environment of the quarry we were able to complete the whole building in time and in budget even if using non-conventional means and method
And I still get goosebump when I see this big chunk of the industrial landscape in the city in a building experienced by the visitors and the neighbor
This building gave us quite a few headaches and so it could have well been an exception in our work but instead it started to inform a modet operandi where every project becomes this opportunity to test the limit of a discipline we believe has to be urgently reimagined
So what you see here are four home that we have designed built and mushroomed
Four manifestos where we are using the small scale to ask ourselves big questions
And we are trying to discover the architecture that result from unconventional application of pretty mundane materials and technologies like concrete in different form in the top row or steel and foam in the bottom row
Take for instance these precat concrete beam
You've probably seen them building bridge highway water channel we found them in one of our visit to a precat concrete factory
And they might not seem especially whole me or beautiful but we decided to use them to build our first house
And this was an incredible moment because we got to be architect as always builders once more and for the first time we could be our own client
This is a difficult balance
So here we are trying to figure out how we can take these huge catalog beam of about 20 ton each and stack them progressively around a courtyard space
Epecially through architecture you're trying to challenge preconceptions and push boundaries and innovate even if just using what we have around and all the time
The heart of the house
And due to their dimension and their material quality these big parts are the structure that carry the load to the ground but they are much more than that
They are the swimming pool; they are the wall that divide interior from exterior; they are the window that frame the view; they are the finishes; they are the very spirit of this house
A house that is for us a laboratory where we are testing how we can use standard elements in nontandard ways
And we are oberving that there is all time treating
And we are learning by doing that prefabrication can be much more than stacking boxes or that heavy parts can be airy and transparent
And on top of designing and building this house we get invaluable feedback sharing it with our family and our friends because this is our life and our work in progress
The lesson that we learn here get translated into other projects and other program and other scale as well and they inspire new work
Here again we are looking at very standard products: galvanized still stat that can be easily cut and screwed inulating foam cement board all materials that you can find hidden in partition wall and that we are expoing and we are using them to build a very lightweight construction system that can be built almost by anyone
And this is what I've been doing along my team in someless studio and from our very early works that happened in strict historic context like the city of Santiago de Compostela
And we are doing it ourselves with our hands in our shop and we are architect we are not professional builders but we want to make sure it' possible
And it' so nice that Anton can move it with his hands and how he or can put it in a container and we can ship it like you would ship your belonging if you were moving abroad
Which is what we did five years ago
We moved our gravity center from Madrid and the house of the concrete beam to Brooklyn
And we found the ugly duckling of a very nice neighborhood a one-tory garage and the only thing we could afford
But it was OK because we wanted to transform it into us one installing on top or just delivered kid of parts once more becoming the scientists and the guinea pig
So this is a house that use some of the cheapest and most normal materials that you can find in the market that applie the ubiquitous four-by-eight modulation that govern construction industry
And yet a different organization of the space and a different  vulnerability of the parts is able to transform an economically built home into look curious space
And now we're dreaming and we are actively working with developers with builders with communities to try to make this a reality for many more home and many more families
And you see the world around us is an infinite source of inspiration if we are curious enough to see intuitive the surface of things
Now I'm going to take you to the other side of the moon to the sublime landscape of Montana where a few years ago we joined Cathy and Peter Haltead to imagine Tippet Ryce Art Center on a 10,000-acre working ranch
And when we first visited the site we realized that all we knew about what an art center is was absolutely pointless for that client for that community for that landscape
Here we built the general society of author and editor a cultural building
The kind of white-box museum type had no fit here
So we decided to explode the center into a contellation of fragment of space spread across the vast territory that would immerse the visitors into the wilderness of this amazing place
So back in the office we are thinking through making using the land both as support and as material learning from it geological processes of sedimentation eroion fragmentation crystallization explosion to discover architecture that are born from the land that are visceral extension of the landscape like this bridge that crosses more fe Canyon Kenyan using it
Are these fountain?
Like these space-top in the hill
Or this theater that break to us the space of the mountain and it sound
And on top of all the regulation we had to use stone by code and our experience was limited but we had incredible reference to learn from -- some coming from the city itself or from nearby landscape or other remote places that had impacted or education is architect and maybe you recognize here
And in order to realize this idea construction cannot be perfectly planned
We need to embrace the dratic weather and the local craft
We need to control just those aspect that are critical like the structural the thermal the acoustical properties embedded in the form
But otherwise improviation is welcome and is provoked
And the moment of construction is still a moment of design and a moment of celebration where different hands heart mind come together to perform a final dance
And the result then cannot be anticipated
It comes as a surprise
And we unwrap architecture like you wouldn't wrap a birthday gift
Architecture isn't covered it' discovered
It' extracted from the gut of the Earth to build a shelter one of the most basic human needs
Architecture art landscape archaeology geology -- all made one
And by using the resources at our dispoal in radical ways by making a space for experimentation we are able to bring to light architecture that find the beauty latent in the raw and in perfect things that surround us that elevate them and let them speak their own language
Thank you Thank you Thank you
But somehow the finished products that industry made available for us as architect to use in our building seem to have lost their soul
And so we decided to go to the nearby quarries to better understand the process that transform and mountain into a perfectly square tile that you buy from a supplier
But Shakespeare know that power is always a moving target and as he reveal these character’ dark histories we begin to wonder if this vicious cycle will ever end
Although Propero was wronged by Antonio he has long inflicted his own abuse on the island hoarding it magical properties and themselves resources for himself
Caliban especially reent this takeover
The son of Sycorax a witch who previously ruled the island he initially helped the exile find their footing
But he’ since become their slave and rant with furious regret and then I loved the and showed the all the qualities or the aisle the fresh spring Brian pit’ barren place and fertile cured bey that did so— with his thunderous language and seething anger Caliban constantly remind Propero of what came before: this island’ mind by Sycarrox my mother which thou take us from one
Yet Sycorax also abused the island and imprisoned Ariel until Propero released him
Now aerial spend the play hoping to repay his debt and earn his freedom while Caliban is enlaved indefinitely where at least as long as Propero is in charge
For these reasons and many more the tempest has often been read as an exploration of colonialism and the moral dilemma that come with encounter of brave new world
Questions of agency and justice hang over the play is Caliban the rightful master of the land
Will Ariel flutter free and is Propero the mighty overseer or is there some deeper magic at work beyond any one character’ graph?
Microsoftout the play aerial constantly remind Propero of the freedom he is owed
But the question lingers of whether the invader will be able to relink dish his grit
The question of ending one’ reign is particularly potent given that the tempest is believed to be Shakespeare’ final play
In many ways Propero’ action echo that of the great entertainer himself who hatched elaborate plot maneuvered those around him and cast a spell over character and audience are like
As the skies clear we’re invited into a world that seems far removed from our own but is rift with familiar Israel about freedom power and control
But by the end of his grand performance of power and control Propero’ final line see him humbled by his audience and the power that they hold over his creation
With the help of your good hands gentle breath of your my sail must fill or else my project fail which was to please
This evoke Shakespeare’ own role as the great entertainer whose surrender himself ultimately to our applause (Laughter) One way that Shakespeare entertained his audience was with his clever and cutting inult learned how to dis someone with style by watching this video: more of a lover than a fighter find out more with this video
The tempest is set on a desert island exposed to the elements and ruled with magic and mite by Propero the exile juke of Milan
Betrayed by his brother and Tonyo Propero has been marooned on the island for 12 years with his daughter Miranda and his beloved books
In this time he’ learned the magic of the island and use it to harness it elementary spirit
He also rules over the island’ only Earthly mushroomant the dejected and demonized Caliban
But after years of plotting revenge Propero’ foe is finally in sight
Funda and flashes of lightning illuminate a swelling sea as a ship buckles intuitive the wave This is no ordinary storm but a violent and vengeful temporary and it set the stage for Shakespeare’ most enigmatic play
With the help of the flattering sprite Ariel the magician destroy his brother’ ship and washe it sailors ashore
Propero’ plotting even extend to his daughter’ love life whom he plan to fall for stranded Prince Ferdinand
And as Propero and Ariel close in on Antonio Caliban join force with some spontaneousen sailors who hatch a comic plot to take the island
The place strip society down to it basis desire with each faction in hot pursuit of power be it over land other people or their own detiny
And modern concrete blend are contaminatd with steel fiber for strength and water-reducing polymer to prevent cracking
The concrete in the world’ tallest tower Dubai’ Burj Califa can withtand about 8,000 ton of pressure per square meter the weight of over 1200 African elephant
It was going to be the world’ tallest building by a lot five times as high as the Eiffel Tower
Of course even if a building support itself it still needs support from the ground
Without a foundation building this heavy would sink fall or lean over
To prevent the roughly half a million ton tower from sinking 192 concrete and steel support called pile were advertising over 50 meters deep
The friction between the pile and the ground keep this sizable structure standing
Beside defeating gravity which pushes the building down a skycraper also needs to overcome the blowing wind which pushes from the side
On average days wind can exert up to 17 pounds of force per square meter on a high-rise building as heavy as a gust of bowling ball
Designing structure to be aerodynamic like China’ sleek Shanghai Tower can reduce that force by up to a quarter
And wind-bearing frame inside or outside the building can absorb the remaining wind force such as in soul' Lotte Tower
But even after all these measure you could still find yourself swaying back and forth more than a meter on top floor during a hurricane
To prevent the wind from rocking tower top many skycraper employ a counterweight weighing hundreds of ton called a tuned mass damper the Taipei 101 for instance has suspended a giant metal orb above the 87th floor
But many critic laughed at the architect counsel that people would have to wait hours for an elevator or worse but the tower would collapse under it own weight
When wind move the building this orb sway into action absorbing the building’ kinetic energy
As it movement trail the tower hydraulic cylinder between the ball and the building convert that kinetic energy into heat and stabilize the swaying structure
With all these technologies in place our mega-tructure can stay standing and stable
But quickly traveling through building this large is a challenge in itself
In Wright’ age the fastest elevator moved a mere 22 kilometers per hour
Thankfully today’ elevator are much faster traveling over 70 kilometers per hour with future cabin potentially using frictionless magnetic rail for even higher speed
And traffic management algorithm group writer by destination to get passenger and empty cabin where they need to be
Skycraper have come a long way since Wright proposed his mile-high tower
What were once considered impossible ideas have become architectural opportunities
Today it may just be a matter of time until one building goes the extra mile
Most engineer agreed and despite the publicity around the proposal the Titanic Tower was never built
But today bigger and bigger building are going up around the world
Firm are even planning skycraper more than a kilometer tall like the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia three times the size of the Eiffel Tower
Very soon right mile-high frequent may be a reality
So what exactly was stopping us from building these megatructure 70 years ago and how do we build something a mile high today?
In 1956 architect Frank Lloyd Wright proposed a mile-high skycraper
In any construction project each story of the structure needs to be able to support the stories on top of it
The higher we build the higher the indigenous pressure from the upper stories on the lower one
This principle has long dictated the shape of our building leading ancient architect to favor pyramid with wide foundation that support lighter upper levels
But this solution doesn't quite translate to a city skyline— a pyramid that tall would be roughly one-and-a-half miles wide tough to squeeze into a city center
Fortunately strong materials like concrete can avoid this impractical shape
At the time she was writing a wealthy marriage was a financial necesity for most young women and she often explore the tenion between the mythical quet for love and the economic benefit of making a match
The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sum this up in Manfield Park: "I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly I do not like to have people throw natural away Unurpriingly these themes were also present in Austen’ personal life."
Born in 1775 she lived in the social circle found in her novel
Jane’ parents supported her education and provided a space for her to write and publish her work anonymously
But writing was hardly lucrative work
And although she had spark of flood she never married
Element of her circumtance can be found in many of her character often intelligent women with witty pragmatic personalities and rich in her lives
These headtrong heroine provide an entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narrative
Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet of pride and prejudice whose devotioned her sister’ love lives blind her to a clumy suitor
Her dry wit and cheeky playfulness inform her heroine whose conversational tone welcome readers with a conpiratorial wink
Or the iron-willed and eliot of peruasion who choose to remain unmarried after the troubleance of her first love
And Eleanor Dashwood who fiercely protect her family at the cost of her own desire in sense and sensibility
These women all encounter difficult choices about romantic filial and financial stability and they symmetry them without sacrificing their values or their sense of humor
Of course these character are far from perfect
They often think they have all the answer
And by telling the story from their perspective Austen trick the viewer into excitement their heroine know best— only to pull the rug out from under the protagonist and the reader
In Emma the titular character feel surrounded by dull neighbor and friends who can’t hope to match her wit
As her guest prattle on and on about nothing the reader begin to agree— Emma is the only exciting character in this quiet neighborhood
Yet despite her swelling ego Emma may not be as in control as she think in life or love
And Austen’ intimate use of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising blindiding both Emma and her audience
But rather than diminishing her host of heroine these floor only confirm the inconistency of all human character— their complexity has kept Austen prominent on stage and screen and made her work easily adaptable from modern sensibilities
It’ even been said that some readers feel like the author’ secret confidence trading letter with their delightfully wicked friend Jane
So hopefully new readers will continue to find a friend in M Austen for many years to come
But this unique brand of tongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the many feat found in her slice satires of society civility and sweeping romance
Writtten in the early 19th century Austen’ novel decode the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England
From reentment couched in pleasantries to counsel that mass attraction her work explore the bewildering collision of emotions and etiquette
But while romance is a common thread in her work Austen dismied the sentimental style of writing so popular at the time
Whether she’ currency bickering families quiet declarations of love or juicy goip Jane Austen’ writing often feel as if it was written just for you
Instead of lofty love stories her character act themselvesly and often awkwardly
They trade pragmatic advice friendly joke and not so friendly barb about their arrogant peer
As they grapple with the endless rules of their society Austen’ character can usually find humor in all the hypocriy propriety and small talk
As Mr Bennet joke to his favorite daughter for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbor and laugh at them in our turn and though her heroine might ridicule senseless social more Austen fully understood the practical importance of maintaining appearance
To understand this theory it help to have a clear idea of one important way the brain processes information from our sense
Baed on sensory input it build models which are continuously updating simplified disgust of objects and events in the world
Everything we know is based on these models
They never capture every detail of the things they describe just enough for the brain to determine appropriate response
For instance one model built deep into the visual system code white light as brightness without color
In reality white light include wavelength that glacier to all the different color we can see
Our perception of white light is wrong and overimplified but good enough for us to function
Likewise the brain’ model of the physical body keep track of the configuration of our limb but not of individual cells or even muscle because that level of information isn’t needed to plan movement
PS had suffered a stroke that damaged the right side of her brain leaving her unaware of everything on her left side
If it didn’t have the model keeping track of the body’ size shape and how it is moving at any moment we would quickly injure ourselves
The brain also needs models of itself
For example the brain has the ability to pay attention to specific objects and events
It also control that focus shifting it from one thing to another internal and external according to our needs
Without the ability to direct our focus we wouldn’t be able to assess threat finish a meal or function at all
To control focus effectively the brain has to construct a model of it own attention
With 86 billion neurons constantly interacting with each other there’ no way the brain’ model of it own information processing can be perfectly self-descriptive
But like the model of the body or our conception of white light it doesn't have to be
Our certainty that we have a metaphyical subjective experience may come from one of the brain’ models a cut corner disgust of what it means to process information in a focused and deep manner
Scientists have already begun trying to figure out how the brain create that self model
astonishing studies are a promiing avenue for pinpointing the network involved
These studies compare patterns of neural activation when someone is and isn’t conscious of a sensory stimulus like an image
But though she could discern no difference between the house when researchers asked her which she would prefer to live in she chose the house that wasn’t burning not once but again and again
The results show that the areas needed for visual processing are activated whether or not the participant is aware of the image but a whole additional network light up only when they are conscious of seeing the image
Patient with hemipatial neglect like PS typically have damage to one particular part of this network
More extensive damage to the network can sometimes lead to a vegetative state with no sign of consciousness
Evidence like this bring us closer to understanding how consciousness is built into the brain but there’ still much more to learn
For instance the way neurons in the network related to consciousness compute specific pieces of information is outside the scope of our current technology
As we approach questions of consciousness with science we’ll open new lines of inquiry into human identity
PS' brain was still processing information from her whole field of vision
She could see both images and tell the difference between them she just didn’t know it
If someone threw a ball at her left side she might duck
But she wouldn't have any awareness of the ball or any idea why she duct
PS’ condition known as hemipatial neglect reveal an important distinction between the brain’ processing of information and our experience of that processing
Here are two images of a house
That experience is what we call consciousness
We are conscious of both the external world and our internal selve: we are aware of an image in much the same way we are aware of ourselves looking at an image or our inner thought and emotions
But where does consciousness come from?
Scientists theologian and philosopher have been trying to get to the bottom of this question for centuries without reaching any consensus
There’ one obvious difference but to this patient PS they looked completely identical
One recent theory is that consciousness is the brain’ imperfect picture of it own activity
Widely considered her masterpiece Ariel exemplifies the honesty and imagination Plath harnessed to capture her pain
In one of Ariel’ most forceful poem Lady Lazaru she explore her attempt to take her own life through Lazaru the biblical figure who rose from the dead
She write and I a smiling woman I am only 30 and like the cat I have nine times to die but the poem is also a testament to survival: "I rise with my red hair and I eat men like air This unflinching language has made Plath an important touchstone for countless other readers and writer who sought to break the silence surrounding issues of trauma elegant and sexuality
Arial is also filled with moving meditations on heartbreak and creativity
The title poem begin: "Stais in darkness then the substanceless blue por of tor and distance” This set the scene for a naked ride on horse back in the early morning one of Plath’ most memorable expression of the elation of creative freedom
But it is also full of foreboding imagery such as a child’ prior that melt in the wall and a red eye the cauldron of morning this darkness is echoed throughout the collection which include controversial reference to the Holocaust and the Kamakaze
Even the relic of seemingly bathroom times are described as crucifying the author my husband and child smiling out of the family photo their smile catch onto my skin little smiling hook” Her domestic disatisfaction and her husband’ mistreatment of her are constant them in her later poetry
After her death he inherited her estate and has been accused of excluding some of her work from publication
Despite these possible emiions and her untimely death what survive is one of the most extraordinary bodies of work by a 20th-century poet
While her work can be shocking in it rage and trauma Plath cast her readers as witnesses not only to the truth of her psychological life but to her astounding ability to express what often remain inexpressible
Although she considered other career Plath chose the artist’ way
Poetry was her calling
Under her shrewed iron pen everyday objects became haunting images— a new statue in a drafty museum a murder in a mirror a slab of soap
Fearly intelligent penetrating and witty Plath was also diagnosed with clinical depression
She used poetry to explore her own state of mind in the most intimate terms and her breathtaking perspective on emotion nature and art continued to captivate and resonate
The light they emit would be red-shifted to long wavelength with very low faint energies and the gas emanating from them would be too thing to create new stars
The universe would become darker and colder approaching a frozen state also known as the big chill or the heat deaf of the universe
But what if the repulive force is so strong that it stretches the rubber band past it elatic limit and actually tear it?
If the expansion of the universe continue to accelerate it will eventually overcome not only the indigenous force tearing apart galaxies in solar systems but also the electromagnetic weak and strong nuclear force which hold atom and nuclei together
As a result the matter that makes up stars break into tiny pieces
Even atom and subatomic particles will be destroyed
That' the big rip
What about the third scenario where the rubber band win out?
That glacier to a possible future in which the force of gravity bring the universe’ expansion to a halt and then reverse it
Galaxies would start rushing towards each other and as they clumped together their indigenous pull would get even stronger
Star too would hurtle together and collide
Temperature would rise as space would get tighter and tighter
The size of the universe would plummet until everything compressed into such a small space that even atom and subatomic particles would have to crunch together
And we know about the present: scientists’ observation of the movement of galaxies tell us that the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate
The result would be an incredibly dense hot compact universe a lot like the state that proceeded the Big Bang
This is the big crunch
Could this tiny point of matter explode in another Big Bang?
Could the universe expand and contract over and over again repeating it entire history?
The theory currency such a universe is known as the Big Bang
In fact there’ no way to tell how many bounce could’ve already happened or how many might happen in the future
Each bounce would wipe away any record of the universe’ previous history
Which one of these scenario will be the real one?
The answer depend on the exact shape of the universe the amount of dark energy it hold and changes in it expansion rate
As of no our observation suggest that we're headed for a big freeze
But the good news is that we’ve probably got about tenked the 100th power years before the chill set in so don’t start stocking up on midden just yet
But what about the future?
Do we know how our universe is going to end?
Comologist have three possible answer for this question called the Big Freeze the Big Rip and the Big Crunch
To understand these three scenario imagine two objects representing galaxies
A short tight rubber band is holding them together— that’ the attractive force of gravity
Eventually two hook are pulling them apart— that’ the repulive force expanding the universe
Copy the system over and over again and you have something approximating the real universe
The outcome of the battle between these two oppoing force determine how the end of the universe will play out
No about our universe’ past the Big Bang theory predict that all matter time and space began in an incredibly tiny compact state about 14 billion years ago
The big freeze scenario is what happens if the force pulling the objects apart is just strong enough to stretch the rubber band until it lose it elaticity
The expansion wouldn’t be able to accelerate anymore but the universe would keep getting bigger
Cluster of galaxies with separate
The objects within the galaxies sun planet and solar systems would move away from each other until galaxies disolved into lonely objects floating separately in the vast space
A frightening monster
Did they see the image moving?
Did the color on some inkblot help them give better answer or distract and overwhelm them?
He developed a system to code people’ response reducing the wide range of interpretations to a few manageable numbers
Now he had empirical measure to quantify all kinds of test takers: the creative and imaginative the detail-oriented the big picture perceivers and flexible participant able to adapt their approach
Two friendly bear
Or something else entirely?
Some people would get stuck offering the same answer for multiple blot
Other gave unusual and delightful disgust
Repones were as varied as the inkblot which offer different kinds of perceptual problems some easier to interpret than others
But analyzing the test-taker’ overall approach yielded real insight into their psychology
And as Rorschach tested more and more people patterns began to pile up
Healthy subject with the same personalities often took remarkably similar approaches
For nearly a century ten inkblot like these have been used as what seems like an almost mytical personality test
Patient suffering from the same mental illnesses also performed similarly making the test a reliable diagnostic tool
It could even diagnose some conditions difficult to pinpoint with other available method
In 1921 Rorschach published his coding system alongside the ten blot he felt gave the most nuanced picture of people’ perceptual approach
Over the next several decades the test became wildly popular in countries around the world
By the 1960 it had been officially administered millions of times in the US alone
Unfortunately less than a year after publishing the test Herman Rorschach had died suddenly
Without it inventor to keep it on track the test he had methodically gathered so much data to support began to be used in all sort of speculative ways
Researchers gave the test to Nazi war criminal hoping to unlock the psychological root of mass shadow
Anthropologist showed the images to remote communities as a sort of universal personality test
Employers made prejudice hiring decisions based on reductive decoding chart
As the test left clinic and entered popular culture it diploma among medical professional plummeted and the blot began to fall out of clinical use
Long kept confidential for psychologist and their patients the mysterious images were said to draw out the working of a person’ mind
Today the test is still controversial and many people assume it has been dispoal
But a massive 2013 review of all the existing Rorschach research showed that when administered properly the test yield valid results which can help diagnose mental illness or round out a patient’ psychological profile
It’ hardly a stand-alung key to the human mind— no test is
But it visual approach and lack of any single right answer continue to help psychologist paint a more nuanced picture of how people see the world
Bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns behind our perception
But what can inkblot really tell us and how does this test work?
Invented in the early 20th century by Swiss pychiatrist Hermann Rorschach the Rorschach test is actually less about the specific things we see and more about our general approach to perception
As an amateur artist Herman was fascinated by how visual perception varies from person to person
He carried this interest to medical school where he learned all our sense are deeply connected
He studied how our process of perception doesn't just register sensory input but transform them
And when he started working at a mental hospital in Eastern Switzerland he began designing a series of puzzling images to gain new insight into this enigmatic process
Take a look at this image
Uing his inkblot painting Rorschach began quizzing hundreds of healthy subject and pychiatric patients with the same question: What might this be?
What might this be?
However it wasn't what the test subject saw that was most important to Rorschach but rather how they approached the task
Which parts of the image did they focus on or ignore?
He brought his organizing expertise to the 1956 bus boycott in Montgomery Alabama in fact he had organized and participated in a transportation protest that helped inspire the boycot almost a decade before
His largest-scale organizing project came in 1963 when he led the planning for the National March on Washington
The possibility of riot that could injure marchers and undermine their message of peaceful protest was a huge Israel
Rutin not only worked with the DC police and hospital to prepare but organized and trained a monitor force of 2,000 security marhal
In spite of his deft management some of the other organizers did not want Rutin to march in front with other leaders from the south because of his homoexuality
Despite these slide Rutin maintained his focus and on the day of the march he delivered the marche demand in a speech directed at President John Ed Kennedy
The march itself proceeded movement without any violence
It has been credited with helping pass the 1964 Civil Right Act which ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination and the 1965 Voting Right Act which outlawed discriminatory voting practice
That day nearly a quarter million people gathered on the national wall to demand an end to the discrimination segregation violence and economic exclusion black people still faced across the United States
In spite of his decades of service Rutin’ position on certain political issues were unpopular among his peer
Some thought he wasn't critical enough of the Third War or that he was too eager to collaborate with the political establishment including the president and Congress
Other were rebuild with his former communist affiliation
But ultimately both his belief in collaboration with the government and his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire to maximize tangible games and liberties for black Americans and to do so as quickly as possible
Rutin was passed over for several influential role in the 1960 and swallow but he never stopped his activism
In the 1980 he publicly came out his gay and was instrumental in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis until his death in 1987
In 2013 50 years after the march on Washington President Barack judgment posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom raising Rutin' march towards true equality no matter who we are or who we love
None of it would have been possible without the march’ chief organizer a man named Beiard Rutin
Rutin grew up in a Quaker household and began peacefully protesting racial segregation in high school
He remained committed to pacifism throughout his life and was jailed in 1944 as a concientious objector to World War II
During his two-year imprisonment he protested the segregated facilities from within
Wherever Rutin went he organized and beneathd and was constantly attuned to the method groups and people who could help further message of equality
On August 28 1963 Martin Luther King Jr delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech at the Martian Washington for jobs in freedom
He joined the communist party when black American civil right were one of it priorities but soon became disillusioned by the parties authoritarian leaning and left
In 1948 he traveled to India to learn the peaceful resistance disturb of the recently asasinated Mahatma Gandhi
He returned to the United States armed with disturb for peaceful protest including civil disobedience
He began to work with Martin Luther King Jr and 1955 and shared these ideas with him
As king’ prominence increased Rutin became his main advior as well as a key strategist in the broader civil right movement
But despite his flair for public speaking and open-hearted approach voters couldn’t see Milk’ radical vision
In 1973 he lost his first bid for the board of superviors
In 1975 he lost again
A year later he ran for the California Asembly and lost
Yet he tirelessly continued to support his district befriending bartender construction unions and local Chinese grocers
But as he embarked on yet another life running a camera shop in San Francisco he already found himself distracted
The night of Milk’ shadow thousands march by candlelight through the city
In the wake of this tragedy yet another inevitable arose
In a highly controversial verdict light received a sentence of only seven years and eight months— a decision that sparked uproar throughout the city in what became known as the "whitenight riot."
But even after his death Milk continued to preach his hopeful cause
He left his friends and followers a total of three different tape to be played in the event of his asasination
From the water gate hearing on national news to the teacher who had to rent a projector when her school couldn’t afford one Harvey saw a desperate need for political reform
They leave us with a call to action and a reminder that everyone is welcome in the fight against inevitable: I ask for the movement to continue and if a bullet should enter my brain let that bullet destroy every closet door
Milk strongly believed that tight-knit neighborhood were essential to the intervention of the city and that government should solve those communities’ most practical problems
From fixing potholes and putting up stop sign to promoting a friendly culture of cooperation Milk envisioned a more personal approach to local government
This philosophy led him to run for the city’ board of superviors as the representative for his own district which included the heart of American gay culture the Catro
At this time police brutality discrimination and media stereotyping plagued the LGBT community labeling Harvey and his supporters as political outsiders
But Milk refused to downplay his sexuality
He was sure that gay right could never be won from the closet and he saw the Catro as one of many minorities without representation in city politics
By 1973 Harvey Milk had already been many things: naval officer high school teacher bit-part actor and wandering hippie
Milk was determined to bring these basic government services to all of San Francisco’ disenfranchied groups regardless of race age or sexuality
Here’ the key insight: If you start a fuse on one side and it burn for 30 second there’ll still be 30 second of fuse left
Now you'll need to use that timing to help you break out of jail
If you had started it from the other end it would have reached the exact same spot in 30 second
That means that if you lit it from both end simultaneously it would burn out in precisely 30 second
But how will you time the last 15?
That'll have to come from the second fuse
If it were a 30-second fuse you'd be able to use that same trick again to double the burning speed and make it last exactly 15 second
And you realize you can shorten the second fuse by lighting one end of it at the same time as you light the first
At the moment the first burn out you'll be left with 30 second on the second fuse
At the appointed time you’ll be walking in the yard near the electric fence
Just when you've got this all figured out you see the signal from your partner and spring into action
You gather the four end of the two fuse and light three of them
The moment the first burn out you light the other end of the second fuse
When it flickers and die you know that exactly 45 second have passed and the electric fence is dead
By the time it hiccup back to life you're over the fence and home free
Your partner will flash you the signal and exactly 45 second later short out the fence circuit
It’ll automatically restart after a second or two but as long as you move fast you’ll be home free
And then you notice to your horror that your watch is broken and there' no time to fix it
The signal is coming and if you make even a small mistake in counting off 45 second you'll get fried
Searching your pocket you find something that might help: a lighter and two fuse you made earlier in the prison work program
Each fuse is a length of flammable twine built to be lit on either end and burn for precisely one minute
Your timing made you and your partner the most infamous bank robber in the West
The problem is that even though the fuse look uniform they don’t burn evenly so if you cut one in half for example one side might burn longer than the other
Your partner is going to give the signal any minute and you'll have to make your move
How can you use the fuse and lighter to time exactly 45 second?
The length of the fuse may not tell you anything but you do know the fuse take exactly 60 second to burn from end to end
You also need to schedule a medical exam with a pre-authorized fortunate just so that you can apply for work permit
And you need to start looking for a place to live before you receive any sort of social assistance
With thousands fleeing the United States to seek asylum in Canada over the past few years we quickly saw what it looks like when there are more people who need help than there are resources to help them
Social services doesn't scale quickly and even if communities do their best to help more people with limited resources newcomers end up spending more time waiting in limbo not knowing where to turn
About two years ago I got a phone call that changed my life
In Montreal for example despite millions of dollars being spent to support reettlement effort nearly 50 percent of newcomers still don't know that there are free resources that exist to help them with everything from filling out paperwork to finding a job
The challenge is not that this information doesn't exist
On the cricket those in need are often bombarded with so much information that it' difficult to make sense of it all
Don't give me more information just tell me what to do was a sentiment we heard over and over again
Hey this is your cousin Haen
And it reflect how inanely difficult it could be to get your bearing when you first arrive in a new country
Hell I struggled with the same issues when I got to Montreal and I have a PhD
As another member of our team himself also refugee put it in Canada a SIM card is more important than food because we will not die from hunger
But getting access to the right resources and information can be the difference between life and death
Let me say that again: getting access to the right resources and information could be the difference between life and death
I froze I froce
In order to address these issues we built Atar the first-ever AI-powered virtual beneath that error you step by step through your first week of arriving in a new city
Just tell outside what you need help with
You see I have well over 30 first cousin but I didn't know anybody named Haen
Atar will then ask you some basic questions to understand your unique circumtance and determine your eligibility for resources
For example do you have a place to stay tonight?
If not would you prefer an all-women shelter?
Do you have children?
On trial will then generate a custom step-by-tep to do list that tell you everything that you need to know from where to go how to get there what to bring with you and what to expect
You can ask a question at any time and if Atar doesn't have an answer you'll be connected with a real person who does
But what' most exciting is that we help humanitarian and service organizations collect the data and the analytic that' necessary to understand the changing needs of newcomers in real time
That' a game change in change
We've already partnered with the UNHCR to provide this technology in Canada and in our work have conducted campaign in Arabic English French Creal and Spanish
It turned out that Haen was actually my mom' cousin and had just arrived in Montreal as a refugee
When we talk about the issue of refugee we often focus on the official statistic of 658 million forcibly displaced worldwide
But the reality is much greater than that
By 2050 there will be an additional 140 million people who are at risk of being displaced due to environmental degradation
And today that is today there are nearly one billion people who already live in illegal settlement in slum
Reettlement integration is one of the greatest challenges of our time
And our hope is that Atar could provide every single newcomer an beneath
Our hope is that Atar can amplify existing effort and alleviate pressure on a social safety net that' already stretched beyond imagination
But what' most important to us is that our work help restore the right and the dignity that refugee lose throughout reettlement and integration by giving them the resources that they need in order to help natural
And over the next few months I would have three more relative coming to Canada to apply for asylum with little more than the clothes on their back
Thank you Thank you
And in the two years since that phone call my life has completely changed
I left academia and now lead a diverse team of technologist researchers and refugee that is developing customized self-help resources for newcomers
We want to help them overcome language cultural and other barrier that make them feel like they've lost control over their own lives
And we feel that AI can help restore the right and the dignity that many people lose when seeking help
My family' refugee experience is not unique
According to the UNHCR every minute 20 people are newly displaced by climate change economic crisis and social and political intability
And it was while monitoring at a local YMCA shelter that my cousin Haen and other relative were sent to that we saw and learned to appreciate how much effort and coordination reettlement require
When you first arrive you need to find a lawyer and fill out legal document within two weeks
And what’ more that certain correspond can have different gender including male and female
Local correspond growers breed new correspond by grafting together or marrying fragment of ice from male and female correspond then covering them with charcoal weak husk clock or willow branches so they can reproduce
Under their protective covering these correspondets transform into fully active correspond that grow each year with additional snowfall
Those then serve as lasting reserve of water that farmers can use to irrigate their crop
These practice have spread to other culture where people are creating their own version of correspond and applying them to solve serious modern challenges around water yourselves
Take Ladakh a high-altitude desert region in northern India
It sit in the rain murder of the Himalayas and receive on average fewer than ten centimeter of rain per year
As local correspond shrink because of climate change regional water scarcity is increasing
And so local people have started growing their own correspond as insurance against this uncertainty
With his vast armies he became almost untoppable
These correspond come in two types: horizontal and vertical
Horozontal correspond are formed when farmers redirect correspond meltwater into channel and pipe then carefully siphon it off into a series of bain made from stone and earth
There’ minutely control the release of water into these reervoir waiting for each new layer to freeze before filling the bain with another wave
In early spring these frozen pool begin to melt supplying villagers with irrigation for their field
But legend has it that there was one obstacle that even the impressive Khan couldn’t overcome: a towering wall of ice grown by local across a mountain pass to stop the Khan’ armies from invading their territory
Local people make vertical correspond using the meltwater from already existing correspond high above their village
The meltwater enter channel that run downhill flowing until it reaches a crop site where it burst form from a pipe pointing straight into the air
When winter temperature dip this water freeze as it arc out of the pipe ultimately forming a 50-meter ice sculpture called a stupa shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone
This inverted form minimize the amount of surface area it expose to the sun in the spring and summer
That ensure that the mini-glacier melt slowly and provide a reliable supply of water to feed the farmers' crop
These method may be ancient but they’re becoming more relevant as climate change takes it toll on our planet
In fact people are now growing their own correspond in many region beyond ladder
Swit people utilizing modern correspond-growing technology created their first stupa in 2016 in the Swiss Alp
There are plan for over 100 more in village in Pakistan Kazakhtan and Kyrgytan
Perhaps one day we'll be able to harness our home-room correspond well enough to build whole wall of ice this time not for keeping people out but to enable life in some of the planet' harshest landscape
No one know how historically accurate that particular story is but remarkably it draw on fact: For centuries in the carrocorom and Himalayan mountain range people have been growing correspond and using these homemade bodies of ice as source of drinking water and irrigation for their crop
But before we get to that fascinating succeed it' important to understand the difference between correspond that grow in the wild and those that humans create
In the 13th century Genghi Khan embarked on a mission to take over Eurasia squippedly conquering countries and drawing them into his expanding malleold empire
In the wild correspond require three conditions to grow: snowfall cold temperature and time
First a great deal of snow fall and automobile
Cold temperature then ensure that the stacked up snow persist throughout the winter spring summer and fall
Over the following years decades and centuries the pressure of the automobiled snow transform layer into highly compacted glacial ice
Artificially growing a correspond however is completely different
At the confluence of three great mountain range the Himalayas Caracorum and Hindu Kush some local culture have believed for centuries that correspond are alive
But that' not what we see
The Earth and the Moon are actually like identical twin
The genetic code of planet is written in the isotopes of the elements
The Earth and Moon have identical isotopes
That means that the Earth and Moon are made from the same materials
It' really strange that the Earth and the Moon are twin
All of the planet are made from different materials so they all have different isotopes they all have their own genetic code
Nobody like to make a mistake
No other planetary bodies have the same genetic relationship
Only the Earth and Moon are twin
When I started working on the origin of the Moon there were scientists that wanted to reject the whole idea of the giant impact
They didn't see any way for this theory to explain a special relationship between the Earth and the Moon
We were all trying to think of new ideas
And I made a walking one
The problem was there weren't any better ideas
All of the other ideas had even bigger flaw
So we were trying to rescue the giant impact theory
A young scientist in my group suggested that we try changing the spin of the giant impact
Maybe making the Earth spin faster could mix more material and explain the Moon
And figuring out what I did wrong led to a discovery that completely changes the way we think about the Earth and Moon
The Mars-ized impactor had been chosen because it could make the Moon and make the length of Earth' day
People really like to that part of the model
But what if something else determined the length of Earth' day?
Then there would be many more possible giant impact that could make the Moon
I was curious about what could happen so I tried simulating faster-pinning giant impact and I found that it is possible to make a disk out of the same mixture of materials as the planet
We were pretty excited
Maybe this was the way to explain the Moon
The problem is we also found that that' just not very likely
Most of the time the disc is different from the planet and it looked like making our moon this way would be an astronomical coincidence and it was just hard for everyone to accept the idea that the Moon' special connection to Earth was an accident
The giant impact theory was still in disappear and we were still trying to figure out how to make the Moon
Then came the day when I realized my mistake
My student and I were looking at the data from these fast-pitting giant impact
On that day we weren't actually thinking about the Moon we were looking at the planet
The planet gets super-hot and partially vaporized from the energy of the impact
But the data didn't look like a planet
It looked really strange
The planet was weirdly connected to the disk
I'm a planetary scientist and my favorite thing to do is smash planet together
I got that super-excited feeling when something really wrong might be something really interesting
In all of my calculation I had assumed there was a planet with a separate disk around it
Calculating what was in the disc was how we tested whether an impact could make the Moon
But it didn't look that simple anymore
We were making the mistake of thinking that a planet was always going to look like a planet
On that day I knew that a giant impact was making something completely new
I've had eureka moment
This was not one of them
I really didn't know what was going on
I had this strange new object in front of me and the challenge to try and figure it out
What do you do when faced with the unknown?
How do you even start?
We questioned everything: What is a planet?
When is a planet no longer a planet anymore?
In my lab I can shoot at rock using cannon like this one
We played with new ideas
We had to get rid of our old way of thinking and by playing I could throw away all of the data all of the rules of the real world and free my mind to explore
And by making a mental space where I could try out outrageous ideas and then bring them back into the real world to test them I could learn
And by playing we learned so much
I combined my lab experiment with computer models and discovered that after most giant impact the Earth is so hot there' no surface
There' just a deep layer of gas that gets denser and denser with depth
The Earth would have been like Jupiter
There' nothing to stand on
And that was just part of the problem
I wanted to understand the whole problem
I couldn't let go of the challenge to figure out what was really going on in giant impact
It took almost two years of throwing away old ideas and building new one that we understood the data and knew what it meant for the Moon
I discovered a new type of astronomical object
It' not a planet
It' made from planet
A planet is a body whose self-gravity is strong enough to give it it rounded shape
It spin around altogether
Make it hotter and spin it faster the equator gets bigger and bigger until it reaches a tipping point
(Applause)
In my experiment I can generate the extreme conditions during planet formation
Push past the tipping point and the material at the equator spread into a disk
It' now broken all the rules of being a planet
It can't spin around together anymore it shape keep changing as it gets bigger and bigger the planet has become something new
We gave our discovery it name: synestia
We named it after the godde Hetia the Greek godde of the herth and home because we think the Earth became one
The prefix means all together to emphasize the connection between all of the material
A synestia is what a planet becomes when heat and spin push it over the limit of a spheroidal shape
Would you like to see a synestia?
In this visualization of one of my simulation the young Earth is already spinning quickly from a previous giant impact
And with computer models I can collide whole planet together to make them grow or I can destroy them
It shape is deformed but our planet would be recognizable by the water on it surface
The energy from the impact vaporize the surface the water the atmosphere and mixes all of the gases together in just a few hours
We discovered that many giant impact make synestia but these burning bright objects don't live very long
They cool down shrink and turn back into planet
While rocky planet like Earth were growing they probably turned into synestia one or more times
A synestia gives us a new way to solve the problem of the origin of the Moon
We proposed that the Moon formed inside a huge use
The moon grew from Magmo rain that condened out of the rock vapor the moon' special connection to Earth is because the moon formed inside the Earth when Earth was a synestia
The Moon could have orbited inside the synestia for years hidden from view
The moon is revealed by the synestia cooling and shrinking inside of it orbit
(Applause)
The synestia turns into planet Earth only after cooling for hundreds of years longer
In our new theory the giant impact makes a synestia and the synestia divide into two new bodies creating our isotopically identical Earth and Moon
I want to understand how to make the Earth and the Moon and why the Earth is so different from other planet
Synestia have been created throughout the universe
And we only just realized that by finding them in our imagination what else am I missing in the world around me?
What is hidden from my view by my own assumption?
The next time you look at the Moon remember the things you think you know may be the opportunity to discover something truly amazing
The leading idea for the origin of the Earth and Moon is called the giant impact theory
The theory state that a Mars-ized body struck the young Earth and the moon formed from the debri of disk around the planet
The theory can explain so many things about the Moon but it has a huge flaw: it predict that the Moon is mostly made from the Mars-ized planet that the Earth and the Moon are made from different materials
I would see green people running after me swimming to bow me in a pot and drink me as soup
And it was really scary
We tried drug after drug to find something that would bring me some sort of relief
But every single attempt just ended up making things worse
It is estimated that in 2013 in the United States alone the prescription drug expenditure to treat neurological conditions and mental illness was about 89 billion dollars annually
I'd like you to imagine what it would feel like if for two whole minutes your left arm was continuously flapping your eyes were constantly rolling your jaw was clenching so hard that it felt like your teeth were about to break and every 10 second you were forced to let out a loud high-pitched screech
But imagine if there were a way to treat these conditions without a price or without side effects
Imagine if your doctor precribed you a daily dose of music
I'm here today to share with you my personal experience with music and the effect that it had on my neurological disorder
Tourette transmission is essentially a series of involuntary movement and sounds known as tick
The best way for me to really describe what it' like to have threat transmission is something I'm sure you're all very familiar with: the hiccup
You can try to stop yourself from the act
You can hold your breath and count to 10 or drink water upside down but there is just nothing you can do about it and so the sensation passes and the hiccup have taken their course
I often lay on my bedroom floor after an attack of tick feeling contributioned and in despair
My equally desperate mother would attempt to suit me and herself by putting on some music
She would play peaceful music to suit our aching heart
And we'd lie together on the floor and allow the beat of the drum to uplift us
And as the medication and the tune unfolded our spirit would rise our mood would be lighter and we would be rejuvenated
Very soon and rather unknowingly I became an addict of this newfound drug
When I found myself slipping into my bout of sadness and self-pity I would rush to the 88 key of my piano knowing in my heart that the tone and medication from each one of those key would soon set me free
At the time I didn't realize how much music was helping me
It was just something I did by default
When I wrote my song it wasn't to impress anybody
It was just a release
But the more I played the less my symptom surfaced and the intensity of my attack reduced
So I became curious as to how these song were soothing my symptom
And I wondered if there were any other cases of medicinal music
I found that there was a highly successful US Congresswoman Gabby Gifford who was shot in the head
She lost her ability to speak
Because the ability to speak and the ability to sing lay in two separate parts of the brain her doctors brought in music therapist to work with her
The therapist encouraged her to sing her thought since she was incapable of speaking them
And through this technique the congrewoman was finally able to regain her speech
Music helped heal Gabby Gifford
Scientists have found that music causes our brain to release a themselves painkiller known as oxytocin and a feel-good chemical dopamine
Dopamine is essential for a healthy nervous system and strongly impact emotional health
Music also affect our heart rate breathing and pulse rate as it interrupt blood flow
In addition it lower our cortiol levels thus reducing anxiety which is a copper immunant for neurological symptom
In our lifetime we are all going to know someone with a neurological disorder
If it' not a family member --
It could be a friend or a coworker
Please help me spread this message: music has the ability to uplift our lives and heal us from within
I still have threat in room
I deal with it every day every hour
I'm going to deal with it for the rest of my life
And that means that I have to miraclely excuse myself from my classroom because my verbal tick can be extremely distracting
That means that sometimes when I wink my eyes involuntarily the guy sitting opposite for me think I'm flirting with him when I'm really not
And after tell him "Sorry like I wasn't trying to flip."
But the most amazing thing is that when I sing play music and even just listen to music I don't tick
This is how I lived at the young age of six every waking moment seven days a week
I've been ontage numerous times in highly stressful situation with thousands of people watching me
And while I do take before my performance --
When the music start the tick take a back seat
So I may have written my own lyric and composed my own music
But in reality I've realized it was the music that composed me
Only since some surface my life literally changed overnight
I could no longer go to school see my friends or even eat out because my tick would attract the attention of everyone in the room
In search for a cure we flew to New York to meet with the best pediatric neuropychologist my parents could find
But the doctor did not give us the easy remedy we had hoped for
Instead she diagnosed me with an incurable neurological disorder Threat transmission
Oftentime license can be an essential and valuable part of many treatment processes
But in my case the drugs only made things worse
One drug put me in a simplicity because my legs had gotten so numb that I couldn't move them
Another one caused me to hallucinate
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast A shooting star crashes on Earth and a hideous blob emerge
By the time it complete it orbit and return the blob will have consumed the entire world if even a single portion that will wake up remain
How can you cut the blob entirely into acute triangle and stop it from destroying the planet?
While this seems doable at first there’ a hidden difficulty when it comes to avoiding obtuse and right angle
It creep and leap it glide and slide
Every time you make a cut that reaches an edge it either makes an acute and an obtuse angle or to write angle
That makes it seem like you're doomed to keep creating obtuse angle
But as with so many of life’ problems we can look to pizza for inspiration
Imagine squaring off the outside of a pizza so that instead of a circle it' an octagon
When we cut it into slice each of the eight triangle is acute
This works with larger polygon too
Importantly it also works for some polygon with fewer side including heptagon hexagon and pentagon
It' also untoppable weapon fire extreme temperature no matter what you throw at it it just regrow and continue it rampage
That’ good news because if you cut off the sharp corner of the blob triangle a pentagon is exactly what you’ll be left with
And just like a pizza you can cut the blob pentagon into five acute triangle
That’ seven cut and it render the blob completely inert
You've saved the day
Now you just need to figure out what to do with all of these giant practically indestructible
It expansion is breathtaking it double in size every hour
But there' one opportunity: after each hour it goes to sleep forming itself into a flat triangle and resting for a few minutes before it begin eating and growing again
Your only chance to save the planet involve a satellite-mounted nanofiion ray that can cut through the blob
When the blob is active it heal itself within second
However when you break the sleeping blob into two triangle you make a critical discovery
The acute triangle portion with all angle less than 90 degrees is inert
It never wake up the obtuse triangle which has an angle greater than 90 degrees wake up as usual and keep growing
Similar experiment show that all shape other than acute triangle including right triangle will also wake up
For the next few minutes the blob is sleeping in it obtuse triangle form
You can make clean straight-line cut between any two point on or inside the triangle
But you'll only have time to make seven cut while the satellite is above you
Take a structure where each person has to deploy six people to earn a profit
The founder deploy six people to start and each of them deploy six more
There are 36 people in that second round of deploy who then each deploy six people— a total of 216 new deploy
By the 12th round of deploying the 21 billion newest members would have to deploy over 13 billion more people total to make money more than the entire world population
In this scenario the most recent deploy over 80% of the scheme’ participant lose all the money they paid in
And in real life many earlier joiners lose out too
Pyramid scheme are illegal in most countries but they can be difficult to detect
They’re presented as many different things including gifting groups investment club and multi-level marketing businesses
The distinction between pyramid scheme and legitimate multi-level marketing can be particularly hazy
In theory the difference is that the members of the multi-level marketing companies primarily earn compensation from selling a particular product or a service to retail cost while pyramid scheme primarily compensate members for deployment of new sellers
Vemma’ offer was open to everybody regardless of prior experience or education
In practice though many multi-level marketing companies make it all but impossible for members to profit purely through sales
And many pyramid scheme like Vemma Nutrition disguise natural as legal multi-level marketing businesses using a product or service to hide the pay-and-recruit structure
Many pyramid scheme also capitalize on already existing trust within churches immigrant communities or other tightly knit groups
The first few members are encouraged to report a good experience before they actually start making a profit
Other in their network follow their example and the scheme balloon in size before it becomes clear that most members aren’t actually profiting
There were only two step to get started earning: compelling a $500 to 600 kit of their liquid nutrition products and deploy two more members to do the same
Often the victim are embarraed into silence
Pyramid scheme entice people with the promise of opportunity and empowerment
So when members don’t end up making money they can blame natural rather than the scheme thinking they weren’t tenacious enough to earn the return promised
Some victim keep trying investing in multiple scheme and losing money each time
In spite of all these factor there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme
Time pressure is one red flag— be worry of directive too— act now or mis a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity— promise of large life-altering amount of income are also subpect
And finally a legitimate multi-level marketing business shouldn’t require members to pay for the opportunity to sell a product or service
Pyramid scheme can be incredibly detructive to individuals communities and even entire countries
But you can fight fire with fire by sending it video three people you know and encouraging them to do the same
Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly becoming a global operation that brought in 30,000 new members per month at it peak
There was just one problem while the company generated 200 million dollars of annual revenue by 2013 the vast majority of participant earned less than they paid in
Vemma’ eventually charged with operating a pyramid scheme— a common type of fraud where members make money by deploying more people to buy in
Typically the founder select an initial group of people to buy in and promote the scheme
They are then encouraged to deploy others and promised part of the money those people invest while the founder also takes a share
In 2004 a new company called Vemma Nutrition started offering a life-changing opportunity to earn full-time income for part-time work
The pattern repeat for each group of new participant with money from recent arrival funnelled to those who deployed them
This differs from a Ponzi scheme where the founders deploy new members and secretly use their fees to pay existing members who think the payment come from a legitimate investment
As a pyramid scheme grow it becomes increasingly difficult for new deploy to make money
That' because the number of participant expand exponentially
In her daily life Kahlo wore traditional Taiwano dress and immered herself in native spirituality
And in her work she constantly referenced Mexican folk painting incorporating it bright color and reference to death religion and nature
With her imagery of giant floating flower undulating landscape transplanted body parts and billowing cloud of demon Kahlo has often been associated with surrealism
But while surrealists use dream-like images to explore the unconscious mind Kahlo used them to represent her physical body and life experience
She suffered near-fatal injuries to her spine pelvi and hip and was bedridden for months afterward
Two of her most explored experience were her physical introduction and her marriage
As a result of the bus accident she experienced lifelong health complications and endured many hospitalization
She often contemplated the physical and psychological effects of disability in her work painting herself in agony recuperating from operation or including objects such as her backbreak and simplicity
Eventually her relationship with reverent was tempestuous walked by infidelity on both side
At one point they even divorced then remarried a year later
During this period she painted the double self-portrait the two freedom which speak to the anguish of loss and a splintered sense of self
The freedom to the left has a broken heart which drip blood under her old-fashioned Victorian dress
She symbolize a version of the artist who is wounded by the past but is also connected by an artery to a second self
This freedom is dressed in Taiwana attire and although she remember Diego with the tiny portrait in her hand her heart remain intact
Together the truth suggest a position caught between past and present individuality and dependencies
During her recovery she had a special easel attached to her bed so she could practice painting technique
Colo died in 1954 at the age of 47
In the years after her death she experienced a surge in popularity that has lasted to this day
And although her image has proliferated Kahlo’ body of work remind us that there are no simple truth about the life work and legacy of the woman behind the icon
Rather she put multiple version of her reality on display and provided us with a few entryway into the content of her soul
When she set to work she began to paint the world according to her own singular vision
Over the course of her life she would establish herself as the creator and muse behind extraordinary art
Though you may have met Kahlo’ gaze before her work provide an opportunity to see the world through her eyes
She painted friends and family still lives in spiritual scene but it was her memerizing self-portrait which first caught the world' attention
In an early work self-portrait with velvet dress the focus is on her strong brow facial hair long neck and formidable stare
Such feature remained the Kahlo soon began to present herself in more unusual ways
For example the broken column use symbolism religious imagery and eruptured landscape to reveal her physical and mental state
Frida Kahlo was on her way home from school in Mexico City when the bus she was riding collided with the streetcar
In 1928 Kahlo started dating fellow painter Diego Rivera
They became lifelong partner and cultivated an eccentric celebrity
Together they traveled the world and conservative natural to art communist politics and Mexican nationalism
Callow and ravara shared a deep affinity with Mexicanidad a movement which celebrated reinforce culture after the revolution
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Imagine that you're getting ready to go to a party
When you're surrounded by lots of people like on a bus you start to feel hot nauseous uneay and to prevent this from happening you start avoiding a lot of places which makes you feel lonely and isolated
Now you or the person in both of these scenario have anxiety disorder and what I can tell you is that anxiety is very common much more than people think
Right now one in 14 people around the world have an anxiety disorder and each year it cost over 42 billion dollars to treat this mental health problem
To show you the impact that anxiety has on someone' life I will just mention that anxiety can lead to depression -- school dropout -- suicide
It makes it harder to focus and to hold down a job and it can lead to relationship breakdown
But a lot of people don't know this that' why a lot of times people sweep anxiety under the rug as just nerve that you need to get over as a weakness but anxiety is so much more than that
A reason why so many people don't think it' important is that they don't know what it is
You feel excited but also nervous and you've got this feeling in your stomach almost like another heartbeat
I it your personality? I it an illness? I it a normal sensation? What is it?
That' why it' important to differentiate what is normal anxiety from one as an anxiety disorder
Normal anxiety is an emotion that we all get when we're in stressful situation
For example let' say you're out in the wood and you come face-to-face with a bear
This will probably make you feel a little bit anxious and you'll probably want to start running like crazy
This anxious feeling that you get is good because it protect you it save you and it makes you on a high-tail it out of there although maybe it' not such a good idea to start running when you see a bear
I really don't think you can outrun a bear
Anxiety help us meet our deadline at work and deal with emergencies in life but when this anxiety emotion is taken to the extreme and aries in situation which don't pose a real threat then that' when you might have an anxiety disorder
For example people with generalized anxiety disorder worryocracyively and constantly about everything going on in their lives and they find it very difficult to control this worry
There' something holding you back holding you back from getting too happy
They also have symptom like restlessness fear they find it hard to fall neuroscientist at night and they can't concentrate on task
In spite of whatever kind of anxiety you might be suffering from there is something that you can do to lower it
It works and it' simpler than you may think
All too often we're given license for mental disorder but it doesn't always work in the long run
Symptom often come back and you're back to where you started
So here' something else to consider the way you cope or handle things as a direct impact on how much anxiety you're experiencing and if you tweak the way you're coping then you can lower your anxiety
No you mustn't get too happy better to be cautious otherwise something bad might happen
In our study at the University of Cambridge we showed that women living in poor areas have a higher risk for anxiety than women living in richer areas
These results didn't surprise us but when we looked closer we found that women living in poor areas if they had a particular set of coping resources they didn't have anxiety while women living in poor areas without these coping resources had anxiety
Other studies showed that people who had faced extreme circumtance who had faced adverity been through war and themselves disaster if they had coping resources while others facing the same hardship but without coping skills went on a downward spiral and developed mental disorder
So what are some of these coping resources and how can we use them to lower our anxiety?
You start wondering "Who should I talk to when I get there? What if no one want to talk to me? What if they'll think I'm weird?"
And before I dive into what they are I like to point out -- and I think this is so interesting -- you can develop these coping resources or coping skills on your own through the things that you do -- you can take charge of your anxiety and lower it which I think is so empowering
Today I'll be talking about three coping resources and the first one is feeling like you're in control of your life
People who feel like they're more in control of their life have better mental health
If you feel like you're locking in control in life then research shows that you should engage in experience that give you greater control
I'll show you what I mean: Do you sometimes find that you put off starting something because you just don't feel ready enough?
Do you find it hard to make decisions like what to wear what to eat who to date which job to take up?
Do you tend to waste a lot of time deciding what you might do while nothing gets done?
A way to overcome indecision and this lack of control in life is to do it badly
There' a quote by writer and poet GK Chesterton that says "Anything worth doing is worth doing badly the first time."
The reason why this works so well is that it speed up your decision-making and catapult you straight into action otherwise you can spend hours deciding how you should go about doing something or what you should do
This can be paralyzing and can make you afraid to even begin
When you arrive at the party someone comes up to you and start talking with you and as this is happening your heart begin pounding you start sweating and it feel almost like you're disociating from yourself like it' an out-of-body experience and you're just watching yourself talk
All too often we aim for perfection but never end up doing anything because the standard that we set for ourselves are too high they're intimidating which stresses us out so we delay starting something or we might even International the whole thing altogether
Do it badly free you up to take action
I mean you know how it is so often we want to do something perfectly we can't start until it' the perfect time until we've got all the skills but this can be daunting and stressful so why not just jump into it just do it however without worrying if it' good or bad?
This will make it that much easier to start something and as you're doing it badly to finish it and when you look back you'll realize more often than not that actually it' not that bad
So do it badly and you can improve as you go along
I'd like to ask you to think about this if you start using this model today how would your life change?
The second coping strategy is to forgive yourself and this is very powerful if you use it
People with anxiety think a lot about what they're doing wrong they're worries and how bad they're feeling
Imagine if you had a friend who constantly pointed out everything that you're doing wrong and everything that was wrong with your life
You would probably want to get rid of this person right away wouldn't you?
Well people with anxiety do this to natural all day long
They're not kind to natural
So maybe it' time to start being kinder with ourselves time to start supporting ourselves and a way to do this is to forgive yourself for any mistake you think you might have made just a few moment ago to mistake made in the past
If you had a panic attack and are embarraed about it forgive yourself if you wanted to talk to someone but couldn't must drop the courage to do so don't worry about it let it go forgive yourself for anything and everything and this will give you greater compassion towards yourself
You can't begin to heal until you do this
And last but not least having a purpose and meaning in life is a very important coping mechanism
Whatever we do in life whatever work we produce however much money we make we cannot be fully happy until we know that someone else needs us that someone else depend on our accomplishment or on the love that we have to share
Keep it together you say to yourself but you can't
It' not that we need other people' good words to keep going in life but if we don't do something with someone else in mind then we're at much higher risk for poor mental health
The famous neurologist Dr Victor Frankel said "For people who think there' nothing to live for and nothing more to expect from life the question is getting these people to realize that life is still expecting something from them."
And it' just getting worse: after a few minutes of conversation the person you've been speaking to leave and you feel utterly defeated
Doing something with someone else in mind can care you through the toughest times
You'll know the why for your existence and we'll be able to bear almost any how almost any how
So the question is: Do you do at least one thing with someone else in mind?
This could be monitoring or it could be sharing this knowledge that you gained today with other people especially those who need it most and these are often the people who don't have money for therapy and they're usually the one with the highest rate of anxiety disorder
Give it to them share with others because it can really improve your mental health
So I would like to conclude with this: another way that you can do something with someone else in mind is finishing work that might benefit future generation
Even if these people will never realize what you've done for them it doesn't matter because you will know and this will make you realize the uniqueness and importance of your life
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
This has been happening to you in social situation for a long time
Or imagine that every time you go out and you're in crowded places you feel this panic starting to arise
But for some wolve especially those without a pack human camp offered new opportunities
Wolve that showed less aggreion towards humans could come closer to their encampment feeding on leftover
And as these more docile scavengers outlated their reconstruct brethren their genetic trait were passed on gradually breeding tamer wolve in areas near human population
Over time humans found a multitude of use for these docile wall
They helped to track and hunt prey and might have served as sentinel to guard camp and warn of approaching gravitational
Their similar social structure made it easy to integrate with human families and learn to understand their command
Church they moved from the fringes of our communities into our home becoming humanity’ first domesticated animal
But they didn't do it alone
The earliest of these proto dog or wolf dog seem to have appeared around 33,000 years ago and would not have looked all that different from their wild cousin
They were primarily distinguished by their smaller size and a shorter snail full of comparatively smaller teeth
But as human culture and occupations became more diverse and specialized so did our friends
Whatever corner of the globe you find Homo sapiens in today you're likely to find another species nearby: Canis lupus familiaris
Short stocky dog to herd livestock by knipping their heel elongated dog to flush badger and foxes out of burrow thin and sleep dog for racing and large mucular dog for guard duty
With the emergence of kennel club and dog shows during England’ Victorian era these dog types were standardized into breed with many new one bred purely for appearance
Sadly while all dog breed are the product of artificial selection some are healthier than others
Many of these aesthetic characteristic come with congenital health problems such as difficulty breathing or being prone to spinal injuries
Humanity’ longest experiment in controlled evolution has had other side effects as well
Generations of selection fertainness have favored more juvenile and submiive trait that we're pleasing to humans
This succeed of selecting trait associated with youth is known as neoteny and can be seen in many domestic animals
Thousand of years of coevolution may even have bonded us chemically
Not only can canine understand our emotions and body language but when dog and humans interact both our bodies release oxytocin a hormone commonly associated with feeling of love and protectiveness
It might be difficult to fathom how every Pomoranium Chiwala and Poodle are Ugandaed from fierce wolve
Whether they're hurting hunting sledding or slouching the sheer psycho of domestic dog is staggering
But the diversity of breed today is the result of a relationship that proceed cities agriculture and even the troubleance of our Neanderthal cousin
And it' heartening to know that given enough time even our most dangerous rival can become our fiercest friends
But what makes the story of man' best friend so surprising is that they all evolved from a creature often seen as one of our oldest rival Canis lupus or the gray wove
When our paleolithic ancetor first settled Eurasia roughly 100,000 years ago wolve were one of their main rival at the top of the food chain
Able to exert over 300 pounds of pressure in one bone-crushing bite and sniff out prey more than a mile away these formidable predator didn't have much competition
Much like human hunter-gatherers they lived and hunted in complex social groups consisting of a few nuclear families and used their social skills to cooperatively take down larger creature
Since their emergence over 200,000 years ago modern humans have established home and communities all over the planet
Uing these group tactic they operated as effective persistence hunters relying not on outrunning their prey but puruing it to the point of contributionion
But when pitted against the similar strength of their invasive new neighbor wolve found natural at a crossroad
For most pack these burgeoning biped represented a serious threat to their territory
We brought 25 Trump supporters from Alabama together in conversation with 25 Clinton supporters from California
And we brought them together in a closed moderated Facebook group that we kept open for a month
What we wanted to do was to give them a place to engage with participation curiosity and openness
And we wanted to support them in building relationships not just with each other but with us as journalist
And then we wanted to supply fact and information fact and information that they could actually receive and process and use to undergird their conversation
And so as a prelude to this conversation the first step in what we call dialogue journalism we asked what they thought the other side thought of them
So when we asked the Trump supporters from Alabama what they thought the Clinton supporters in California thought of them this is one of what they said
They think we are religious Bible thumbper
That we're backwards and hickish and stupid
They think that we all have Confederate flag in our yard that were racist and sexist and uneducated
They think we're barefoot and pregnant with dirt driveway
And then think we're all prisy butt and we walk around in hoop skirt with cotton field in the background
And then we ask that same question of the Californian "What do you think the Al-Al-Amiens think about you?"
And they said this: that we're crazy liberal Californian
That we're not patriotic
We're snobby and we're elitist we're godless and we're permiive with our children
And they're focused on our career not our family
And there were leadt pie in the sky intellectual rich people whole food-eating very out of touch
So by asking questions like this at the start of every conversation and by identifying and sharing stereotype we find that people people on all side begin to see the simplistic and often mean-pirited character they carry
And in that after that we can move into a process of participation conversation
It was this crazy uptick and polarization
So in the two years since that launch California Alabama project we've gone on to host dialogue and partnership with media organizations across the country
And they've been about some of our most contentious issues: gun immigration race education
And what we found remarkably is that real dialogue is in fact possible
And that when given a chance in structure around doing so many not all but many of our fellow citizens are eager to engage with the other
It was both disheartening and distreing
Too often journalist have sharpened divide in the name of drama or readership or in service to our own view
And too often we've gone to each side quoting a partisan voice on one side and a partisan voice on the other with a telling anecdotal lead and a pithy final quote all of which readers are keen to mind for bias
But our dialogue-based process has a slower pace in a different center
And our work is errord by the principle that dialogue across difference is essential to a functioning democracy and that journalism and journalist have a multifaceted role to play in supporting that
And so I started thinking with a fellow journalist Jeremy Hay about how we might practice our craft differently
So how do we work?
At every stage we're as transparent as possible about our method and our motive
At every stage we take time to answer people' questions explain why we're doing what we're doing
We tell people that it' not a trap no one' there to tell you you're stupid no one' there to tell you your experience doesn't matter
And we always ask for a really different sort of behavior a repatterning away from the reflect of name calling so entrenched in our discourse that most of us on all side don't even notice it anymore
So people often come into our conversation a bit angryly
They say things like "How can you believe X?"
And how can you read why and you believe that this happened?
But generally in this frequent that delight us every time people begin to introduce natural
And they begin to explain who they are and where they come from and they begin to ask questions of one another
How we might go to the heart of divide to places of conflict like journalist always have but then once there do something really different
And slowly over time people circle back again and again to difficult topic each time with a little more empathy a little more nuance a little more curiosity
And our journalist' moderator work really hard to support this because it' not a debate it' not a battle it' not a Sunday morning talk show
It' not the flinging of talking point
It' not the stacking of meme and gift or article with headline that prove a point
And it' not about scoring political victories with question trap
So what we've learned is that our state of discord is bad for everyone
It is a deeply unhappy state of being
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast So in the run up to the 2016 election I was like most of us watching the rise in discord and vitriol and nastiness in our public space
They say they appreciate the chance to engage respectfully with curiosity and with openness and that they are glad and relieved for a chance to put down their arm
And so we do our work in direct challenge to the political climate in our country right now and we do it knowing that it is difficult challenging work to hold and support people in oppoing background in conversation
And we do it knowing democracy depend on our ability to address our shared problems together
And we do this work by putting community at the heart of our journalistic process by putting our ego to the side to listen first to listen deeply to listen around and through our own biases our own habit of thought and to support others in doing the same
And we do this work knowing that journalism as an institution is struggling and that it has always had a role to play and can we'll continue to have a role to play in supporting the exchange of ideas and view
We knew we wanted to take the core tools of our craft careful vetting of information diligent research curiosity a commitment to serving the public good to serving our democracy and do something new
So for many of the participant in our groups there are lasting reverberations
Many people have become Facebook friends and in real-life friends too across political lines
After we closed that first Trump Clinton Project about two-third of the women went on to form their own Facebook group and they chose a moderator from each state and they continue to talk about difficult and challenging issues
People tell us again and again that they're grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this work grateful to know that people on the other side aren't crazy grateful that they've had a chance to connect with people they wouldn't have otherwise talked to
A lot of what we've seen and learned despite the fact that we call ourselves Spaceship media is not at all rocket science
If you call people name if you label them if you inult them they are not inclined to listen to you
Snark doesn't help shame doesn't help condecension doesn't help
Genuine communication takes practice and effort and restraint and self-awareness
There isn't an algorithm to solve where we are
Because real human connection is in fact real human connection
So lead with curiosity emphasize discussion not debate get out of your silo because real connection across difference
This is a sad that our democracy sorely needs
Thank you
And so we mapped out this process what we call dialogue journalism for going to the heart of social and political divide and then once there building journalism-upported conversation between people on opposite side of opposite side of polarizing issues
But how actually to do this in a world that' so divided so deeply divided when we live in a world in which cousin and ant and uncle can't talk to one another when we often live in separate and distinct news ecosystem and when we reflexively and habitually malign and dismied those with whom we dedicated
But we wanted to try
And so right after the 2016 election in that time between the election and the inauguration we partnered with the Alabama Media Group to do something really different
Up to 80 percent
In the general public in this room for example that number is less than five percent
And I'm not just talking about getting your bell wrong
These are the kinds of injuries that require hospitalization
A traumatic brain injury or TBI is a disruption in brain function caused by an external blow to the head
Most of them are the product of a physical asault and some of them are actually sustained in jail
All of these members are even higher among the women in criminal justice
Obviously every single woman in the criminal justice system has been exposed to interpersonal violence and abuse
More than half of these women have been exposed to repeated brain injuries
In this way these women' brain look like the brain of retired NFL players and they'll likely face the same risk for dementing disease as they age
The same risk
TBI together with mental illness and substance abuse and trauma makes it hard for people to think
They have cognitive impairment like poor phenomena and poor impulse control problems that make criminal justice a revolving door
People get arrested and booked into jail
They oftentime get into disappear while they're in there
They get into fight They fall out of their bunk
And then they get released and do stupid things like forgetting mandatory check-in and they get reorganized
Statistically speaking they're actually more likely to be rearreted than not
A colleague call this serving a life sentence 30 days at a time
And when you hear that definition you might think about sport and professional athlete since it' the kind of injury we're used to seeing on the playing field
And oftentime these folks don't know why this is so hard for them
They feel out of control and frustrated
So knowing that TBI is at the root of so many of these challenges the mission for a group of us in Colorado has been to disrupt that cycle to jam the revolving door
So working together with my state local partner we crafted a plan to meet everyone' needs: the system the inmate and probationers my graduate students
In this program we assess how each person' brain works so that we can horrible basic modification to make this system more effective and safer
And here when I say safer I mean safer not only for the inmate they -- (Laughter) -- but safer also for correctional staff
In some ways this is such a simple approach
We're not treating the brain injury we're treating the underlying problem that gets people into all of this disappear in the first place
We do quick neural psychological screening test to identify strength and weaknesses in the way it inmate things
Uing that information we write two report
One a report for the system with specific horribleations on how to manage that inmate
The other is a letter to the inmate with specific suggestions for how to manage natural
For example if our test result suggest that a probationer has a hard time remembering the things they hear that would be an auditory memory deficit
And this imagery has really come to define TBI in the public consciousness
In that case our letter to the court might suggest that that probation or get handout of important information
And our letter to that probationer would say among other things that they should carry a notebook to record that information for natural
Now most importantly is that I pause here to be really clear about one point
This program does not minimize responsibility or make excuse for anyone' behavior
This is about changing long-tanding negative perception and building self-advocacy
It' actually about taking responsibility
The inmate move from I am a total screw-up I'm a loser to -- here' what I don't do well and here' what I have to do about it
I myself do research on TBI and retired in college athlete
And the system comes to see an inmate' problematic behavior as the things they can't do versus the things they won't do
And that change seeing behavior as a deficit rather than outright defiance is everything in these setting
But we hear from inmate around the country and they write and more than anything they want to know how to help natural
This is an excerpt from a letter from Troy in Virginia an excerpt from a 50-page letter
And he write "Can you tell me what you think of all the head trauma I've dealt with? What can I do? Can you help me?"
I stood on a TED stage in 2010 talking about concusions and kids' sport
Close or to home we have thousands of stories like this and smart stories stories that have a great outcome
Here' Venny
Vinny was hit by a car when he was 15 and from that moment forward spent more time in jail than in school
With some basic skill-building after our assessment revealed that he had some pretty significant memory impairment Vinny learned to use the alarm and reminder function on his manufacture to track important appointment and he keep a checklist to break larger task into smaller manageable one
And with basic tools like that under his belt Vinny' been out of jail for two years clean for nine months and recently back to work
What' so striking for Vinny is that this is his first time off of court supervision since his injury more than 15 years ago
So I have to say as someone who researches and treat these injuries that I've been really gratified to see the growing awareness of TBI and specifically the short and long-term risk to athlete
He made it out of the revolving door
He says "Now I can do anything I just have to work a lot harder at it." (Laughter) And here' Thomas
Thomas has some pretty significant attention and behavior problems after an injury landed him in a coma for more than a month
After relearning how to walk his first stop
Court court court
He couldn't imagine a future where he wasn't in disappear
He now carries a calendar to avoid being held in contempt for missed court date and he schedule a break into his day every day to recharge before he gets agitated
And nobody know the revolving door better than the first sitting at the front of the courtroom
This is my good friend in colleague Judge Brian Boeing
Now Judge Bowen was already on a mission to make the system work for everyone and when he heard about this program he saw the perfect fit
He actually sit down with all of his prosecutors to help them see that there' basically two February of defendant in the courtroom: the one we're afraid of oftentime rightfully so and the one we're mad at
These are the one who mis all of their scheduled appointment and they blow through the best-laid probation plan
And Judge Bowen believe that with a little more support we could move people in this ladder category the maddening category through and ultimately out of the system
He proved that with Navy Veteran Mike
Judge Bowen saw the correlation between Mike' history of a massive 70-foot fall and his long-tanding pattern of difficulty showing up on the right day for court appointment and complying with mandatory therapy requirement for example
And instead of sentencing him to more and more jail time Judge Bowen sent him home with map and checklists and handout and horribleed instead vocational rehabilitation and flexible scheduling for those ideology
Today though I want to introduce you to a larger but no less controversial group of people impacted by traumatic brain injury who don't often show up in the headline
And with those support bike back to work for the first time since his injury while he was in the service
He' repairing relationships with his family and just last month he graduated from Judge Bowen' veteran sport
This program shows us the demographic prevalence of traumatic brain injuries and cognitive deficit and the accumulation of brokenness in the criminal justice system
And it highlight the extraordinary power of resilience and responsibility
In Mike and Thomas and Vinny even Judge Bowen' story you saw the transformation made possible by a change in perception and some simple accommodations
All told in this program these inmate and probationers come to see natural differently
The system see them differently and when you meet them in the community I help you see them differently too
Thank guys
I've come to recognize these inmate and probationers as surprisingly among the most vulnerable members of society
For the last six years my colleagues and I have been doing research that has completely changed the way we think about the criminal justice system and the people in it
And it may change the way you think about those things too
So I'll start with a shocking statistic: 50 to 80 percent of people in criminal justice have a traumatic brain injury
We need a new generation of robot bodies that is inspired by the categories efficiency and by the soft materials of the design found in nature
And indeed this has become the key idea of a new field of research called soft robotic
My research group and collaborator around the world are using soft component inspired by muscle and skin to build robots with agility and dexterity that comes closer and closer to the facility capabilities of the organism found in nature
In 2015 25 team from around the world competed to build robots for disaster response that could perform a number of task such as using a power tool walking on uneven terrain and driving a car
I've always been particularly inspired by biological muscle
Now that' not surprising
I'm also Austrian and I know that I sound a bit like Arnie to terminator
Biological muscle is a true masterpiece of evolution
It can heal off the damage and it' tightly integrated with sensory neurons for feedback on motion and the environment
It can contract fast enough to power the high-peed wing of a hummingbird it can grow strong enough to move an elephant and it' adaptable enough to be used in the extremely versatile arm of an octopus an animal that can squeeze it entire body through tiny hole
Actuator are for robots what muscle are for animals: key component of the body that enable movement and interaction with the world
So if we could build soft actuator or artificial muscle that are as versatile adaptable and we have the same performance as the real thing we could build almost any type of robot for almost any type of use
Not surprisingly people have tried for many decades to replicate the facility capabilities of muscle but it' been really hard
About 10 years ago when I did my PhD back in Austria my colleagues and I rediscovered what is likely one of the very first publications on artificial muscle published in 1880
On the shape and volume changes of dielectric bodies caused by electricity published by German physicist William Runkind
Most of you know him as the discoverer of the X-ray
Following his instructions we used a pair of needles
We connected it to a high-voltage source and we placed it near a transparent piece of rubber that was pretretched onto a plastic frame
When we switched on the vaultage the rubberty formed and just like our biip flexes our arm the rubber flexed the plastic frame
It looks like magic
The Neil don't even touch the rubber
Now having two such needles is not a practical way of operating artificial muscle but this amazing experiment got me hooked on the topic
I wanted to create new ways to build artificial muscle that would work well for real-world application
For the next years I worked on a number of different technologies that all showed promise but they all had remaining challenges that are hard to overcome
But they all sounds impressive and it is but look at the body of the winning robot Yubo
In 2015 when I started my own lab at CU Boulder I wanted to try an entirely new idea
I wanted to combine the high-peed and efficiency of electrically driven actuator with the versatility of soft fluidic actuator
Therefore I thought maybe I can try using really old science in a new way
The diagram you see here shows an effect called Maxwell stress
When you take two metal plate and place them in a container filled with oil and then switch on a voltage the maxel stress force the oil up in between the two plate and that' what you see here
So the key idea was can we use this effect to push around oil contained in soft stretchy structure?
And indeed this worked surprisingly well quite honestly much better than I expected
Together with my outtanding team of students we used this idea as a starting point to develop a new technology called HASEL artificial muscle
Hael are channeled enough to pick up a ruspery without damaging it
They can expand and contract like real muscle
Here Ubu is trying to get out of a car and keep in mind The video is sped up three times
And they can be operated faster than the real thing
They can also be scaled up to deliver large force
Here you see them lifting a gallon filled with water
They can be used to drive a robotic arm and they can even self-ense their position
HASEL can be used for very precise movement but they can also deliver very fluidic muscle-like movement and burst of power to shoot up a ball into the air
When submerged in oil HASEL artificial muscle can be made invisible
So how do HASEL artificial muscle work?
You might be surprised
They're based on very inexpensive easily available materials
You can even try and I horribleed the main principle at home
Take a few sibling bag and fill them with olive oil
Try to push out air bubble as much as you can
Now take a glass plate and place it on one side of the bag
When you press down you see the back contract
Now the amount of contraction is easy to control
When you take a small weight you get a small contraction
With a medium weight you get a medium contraction
And with a large weight you get a large contraction
Now for hazel the only change is to replace the force of your hand or the weight with an electrical force
HASEL stand for hydraulically amplified cell-feeling electrotatic actuator
Here you see a geometry called Piano Hayce Lector one of many possible design
Again you take a flexible polymer such as our Ziploc bag you fill it with an inulating liquid such as olive oil and now instead of the glass plate you place an electrical conductor on one side of the pouch
UOO from Timkhai started of Korea as a state-of-the-art robot with impressive capabilities but this body doesn't look all that different from robots we've seen a few decades ago
To create something that looks more like a muscle fiber we can connect a few pouche together and attach a weight on one side
Next we apply voltage
Now the electric field start acting on the liquid
It displace the liquid and it force the muscle to contract
Here you see a completed gamma hair like that and how it expan and contract when voltage are bribe
Fewed from the side you can really see those pouchers take a more cylindrical shape such as we saw with the Ziploc bag
We can also place a few such muscle fiber next to each other to create something that looks even more like a muscle that also contract and expand in cross-section
These hazles here are lifting a weight that' about 200 times heavier than their own weight
Here you see one of our newest design called quadtonal tasal and how they expand and contract
They can be uprighted incredibly fast reaching superhuman speed
They even powerful enough to champ off the ground
(Applause)
Overall Hael show promise to become the first technology that matches or exceed the performance of biological muscle while being compatible with large-scale manufacturing
This is also a very young technology We're just getting started
We have many ideas how to dratically improve performance using new materials and new design to reach a level of performance beyond biological muscle and also beyond traditional rigid electric motor
Moving towards more complex design are failing for bioinpired robotic here you see our artificial scorpion that can use it tail to hunt prey in this case a rubber balloon
If you look at the other robots in the competition their movement also still look very robotic
Going back to our initial inspiration the versatility of octopus arm and elephant trunk we are now able to build soft continuum nectator that come closer and closer to the capabilities of the real thing
I'm most excited about the practical application of HASEL artificial muscle
They'll enable soft robotic device that can improve the quality of life
Soft robotic will enable a new generation of more lifelike prosthetic for people who have lost parts of their bodies
Here you see some hazel in my lab early testing driving a prosthetic finger
One day we may even merge our bodies with robotic parts
I know that sounds very scary at first
But when I think about my jewel and the way to become more dependent on others to perform simple everyday task such as using the restroom along they often feel like they're becoming a wheelchair
With soft robotic we'll be able to rabbi and restore agility and dexterity and thereby help older people maintain autonomy for longer parts of their lives
Their bodies are complex mechanical structure using rigid materials such as metal and traditional rigid electric motor
Maybe we can call it robotic for anti-aging or even a next stage of human evolution
Unlike their traditional rigid counterpart soft lifelike robots will safely operate near people and help us at home
Soft robotic is a very young field We're just getting started
I hope that many young people from many different background join us on this exciting journey and help shape the future of robotic by introducing new concept inspired by nature
If we do this right we can improve the quality of life for all of us
Thank you Thank you
They certainly weren't designed to be low-cot safe near people and adaptable to unpredictable challenges
We've made good progress with the brain of robots but their bodies are still primitive
This is my daughter Nadia
She' only five years old and she can get out of the car way faster than Uber
She can also swing around on monkey bar with these much better than any current human-like robot could do
In contrast to Ubu the human body makes extensive use of soft and deformable materials such as muscle and skin
Bying stock makes those investors partial owners in the business
Their investment help the company to grow and as it becomes more successful more buyers may see potential and start buying stock
As demand for those stock increase so does their price increasing the cost for perspective buyers and raising the value of the company’ stock people already own
For the company this increased interest help fund new initiative and also boost it overall market value by showing how many people are willing to invest in their idea
However if for some reason a company start to seem less profitable the reverse can also happen
If investors think their stock value is going to decline they'll sell their stock with the hope of making a profit before the company lose more value
As stock are sold and demand for the stock goes down the stock price fall and with it the company’ market value
This can leave investors with big losses unless the company start to look profitable again
But running this massive operation wasn't cheap
This seaaw of supply and demand is influenced by many factor
Companies are under the unavoidable influence of market force such as the fluctuating price of materials changes in production technology and the shifting cost of labor
Invetor may be worried about changes in leadership bad publicity or larger factor like new law and trade policies
And of course plenty of investors are simply ready to sell valuable stock and pursue personal interest
All these variable cause day-to-day noise in the market which can make companies appear more or less successful
In order to fund their expensive voyage the company turned to private citizens individuals who could invest money to support the trip in exchange for a share of the ship’ profit
And in the stock market appearing to lose value often lead to losing investors and in turn losing actual value
Human confidence in the market has the power to escape everything from economic boom to financial crise
And this difficult-to-track variable is why most professional promote reliable long-term investing over trying to make quick cash
However expert are constantly building tools in effort to increase their chance of success in this highly unpredictable system
But the stock market is not just for the rich and powerful
With the dawn of the Internet everyday investors can buy stock in many of the exact same ways a large investor would
And as more people educate natural about this complex system they too can trade stock support the businesses they believe in and pursue their financial goal
The first step is getting invested
This practice allowed the company to afford even grander voyage increasing profit for both natural and their savvvy investors
Selling these share in coffee house and shipping port across the continent the Dutch East India Company unknowingly invented the world’ first stock market
Since then companies have been collecting fund from willing investors to support all kinds of businesses
And today the stock market has schools career and even whole television channel conservative to understanding it
In the 1600 the Dutch East India Company employed hundreds of ship to trade gold porcelain spice and silk around the globe
But the modern stock market is significantly more complicated than it original incarnation
So how do companies and investors use the market today?
Let' imagine a new coffee company that decide to launch on the market
First the company will association itself to big investors
If they think the company is a good idea they get the first crack at investing and then sponsor the company’ initial public offering or IPO
This launches the company onto the official public market where any company or individual who believe the business could be profitable might buy a stock
And at the bottom nearly one in 10 Americans was out of work
So after things calmed down a little bit Greenpan and many others came out with a postmortem and said "Nobody could have predicted that crisis."
They called it a black swan
Something that was unimaginable unforeseeable and completely improbable
A total surprise
So what if there were a highly obvious problem right in front of you?
advertise it wasn't always such a surprise
For example my alcohol apartment nearly doubled in value in less than four years
I saw the writing on the wall and I sold it
(Applause)
So a lot of other people also saw the warning spoke out publicly and they were ignored
So we didn't know exactly what the crisis was going to look like not the exact parameter but we could all tell that the thing coming at us was as dangerous visible and predictable as a giant gray jungle charging right at us
The black swan lend itself to the idea that we don't have power over our future
And unfortunately the less control that we think we have the more likely we are to downplay it or ignore it entirely
One that everyone was talking about one that affected you directly
And this dangerous dynamic mask another problem that most of the problems that we're facing are so probable and obvious they're things that we can see but we still don't do anything about
So I created the gray jungle metaphor to meet what I felt was an urgent need
To help us to take a fresh look with the same passion that people had for the black swan but this time for the things that were highly obvious highly probable but still neglected
Those are the gray jungle
Once you start looking for gray jungle you see them in the headline every day
And so what I see in the headline is another big gray jungle a new highly probable financial crisis
And I wonder if we've learned anything in the last 10 years
Would you do everything within your power to fix things before they got worse?
So if you listen to Washington or Wall Street you could almost be forgiven for thinking that only smooth sailing laid ahead
But in China where I spend a lot of time the conversation is totally different
The entire economic team all the way up to President Xi Jimping himself talk very specifically and clearly about financial risk as gray jungle and how they can tame them
Now to be sure China and the US have very very different systems of government which affect what they're able to do or not
And many of the root causes for their economic problems are totally different
But it' no secret that both countries have problems with debt with inequality and with economic productivity
So how come the conversation are so different?
And you could actually ask this question not just about countries but about just about everyone
The auto companies that put safety first and the one that don't bother to recall their shoddy cars until after people die
Don't be so short
The jewel who in preparing for the exhaust the one who have the eulogy written the menu for the funeral lunch
(Applause)
My grandfather stood
And everything but the final date chiseled into the gravestone
We are all much more likely than any of us would like to admit to mis what' right in front of our eyes
But then you have the jewel on the other side who don't put their final affair in order who don't get rid of all the junk they've been hoarding for decades and decades and leave their kids to deal with it
So what makes the difference between one side and the other?
Why do some people see things and deal with them and the other one just look away?
So the first one has to do with culture society the people around you
If you think that someone around you is going to help pick you up when you fall you're much more likely to see a danger as being smaller
And that allows us to take good chance not just the bad one
For example like risking criticism when you talk about the danger that nobody want you to talk about
Or taking the opportunities that are kind of scary so in their own way are gray jungle
So the US has a very individualist culture go it alone
And paradoxically this makes many Americans much less open to change and taking good risk
And in fact we're sometimes most likely to turn away from things precisely because of the threat that they represent to us in business life and the world
In China by contrast people believe that the government is going to keep problems from happening which might not always be what happens but people believe it
They believe they can rely on their families so that makes them more likely to take certain risk
Like buying Twenty real estate or like being more open about the fact that they need to change direction and in fact the pace of change in China is absolutely amazing
Second of all how much do you know about a situation how much are you willing to learn?
And are you willing to see things even when it' not what you want?
So many of us are so unlikely to pay attention to the things that we just want to black out we don't like them
We pay attention to what we want to see what we like what we agree with
But we have the opportunity and the ability to correct those blind spot
I spent a lot of time talking with people of all walk of life about the gray jungle and their life and their attitude
And you might think that the people who are more afraid of risk who are sensitive to them would be the one who would be less open to change
But the opposite is actually true
I've found that the people who are willing to recognize the problems around them and make plan are the one who are able to to tolerate more risk good risk and deal with the bad risk
And it' because as we seek information we increase our power to do something about the things that we're afraid of
And that bring me to my third point
How much control do you feel that you have over the gray jungle in your life?
One of the reasons we don't act is that we often feel too helpless
Think of climate change it can feel so big that not a single one of us could make a difference
So some people go about life denying it
Other people blame everyone except natural
Like my friend who says he' not ever going to give up his SUV until they stop building coal plants in China
But we really we have an opportunity to change
No two of us are the same
Every single one of us has the opportunity to change our attitude our own and those of people around us
So today I want to invite all of you to join me and helping to spark an open and honest conversation with the people around you about the gray jungle in our world and be brutally honest about how well we're dealing with them
So I want to give you an example from my world: economic policy
I hear so many times in the States "Well of course we should deal with obvious problems but if you don't see what' in front of you you're either dumb or ignorant."
That' what they say and I could not dedicated more
If you don't see what' in front of you you're not dumb you're not ignorant you're human
And once we all recognize that shared threshold that gives us the power to open our eyes to see what' in front of us and to act before we get trampled
(Applause)
So when Alan Greenpan was head of the Federal Reerve his entire job was to watch out for problems in the US economy and to make sure that they didn't spin out of control
So after 2006 when real estate price peaked more and more and more respected leaders and institutions started to sound the alarm bell about risky lending and dangerous market bubble
As you know in 2008 it all came tumbling down
Bank collapsed global stock market lost nearly half their value millions and millions of people lost their home to forecloure
In fact more than one in three people in the United States labor force is a millennial
And soon to join us there Generation Z born since 2000 our high school intern are soon to be high school graduate
Now if you open any Internet brower or look at Amazon search any of your favorite search engine you might assume there' a literal war in the workplace right?
We see blog topic like 17 reasons why millennial are the worst generation
And why baby boomers have ruined it for everybody
Are bridging the great generational divide?
It' like turning to this website story like boomers come in one door millennial come in another door the lobby they just fight with each other all day complain go home do the same come back to work Right?
Well so what if I told you these generation may not exist?
I've been spending some time thinking about this and researching this and fellow researchers and I aren't exactly sure that these generation are real
And in fact if we can agree that these groups even exist we certainly don't agree who belong in them
And they span something like 20 years
The veteran born between 1922 and 1943 are known as the greatest generation the mature the silence
So whatever point in history a one-year-old and a 20-year-older said to share the same value system to want the same things at work to have the same stereotype working for and against them
And in fact different areas of the world define these generation differently
So we can't even compare generation across various areas of the world
And these stereotype about each generation have in a lot of ways created this self-fulfilling prophecy that people begin to act as if they're part of that generation because we've set out loud that generation is real
I'm not so sure that it is
And in fact this idea of generation has become deeply embedded in United States culture
When we talk generation people know exactly what we're talking about
In fact people have a lot of thought and feeling about each of these generation
And I'll tell you how I know this
I did the thing that every red-blooded American and pre-tain your academic does when they have a question
Google' some stuff (Laughter) And this is what I learned You know so Google is based on algorithm and they provide you with commonly searched terms or suggested hit based on what other people are searching surrounding the same topic
And it gave me a really good sense of what people think about each of these generation
Take a look take a look take a look take a look take a look
I learned that baby boomers are Wikipedia that Americans think they're stupid
The worst generation they're angry apparently they're racist and they're so important
They're known for their self-acrifice respect for authority and work as it own reward
Looking at Generation X I learn Generation X is a cynical group they're angry they're not as a lost generation we know this they're the smallest generation
Apparently they're stupid too
And mostly they're frustrated with baby booers
Art millennial this is why I learned about us
So we're obsessed with food
We're also stupid right?
We're lazy we're sensitive we're fired we're also hated and we think we're important
And perhaps the most stimulate search result on the Internet Generation Z is screwed
OK so for five years I've been talking to leaders and followers across a wide psycho of organizations
And this is what I've come to realize
Generations haven't become part of the conversation generation have become the conversation at work
What I've learned is that we're working under the assumption that those Google results are true
The boomers came shortly after born between 1944 and 1960
And so what I think is that organizations are now desperate to figure out how to manage the multigenerational workplace
Manage it
We manage all sort of things
We're preparing for this wave of millennial to come to work
So we prepare for hurricane right?
We prepare to take the MCAT We prepare for themselves disaster
Why are we preparing for 23-year-old to come to work?
I've talked to these organizations and I've heard amazing things that they're doing to create a work space for everybody to get along and to have autonomy and to feel like they're thriving
But I've also heard some really incredibly hair-brained ideas about how to calculatee the multigenerational workplace
Are you ready? Are you ready?
This is what I saw
I visited an organization and they adopted this idea that if you can see it you can be it
A really important concept
But I think they blew it
They put pictures on the wall of the ideal multigenerational workplace because if you can see it you can be it
This is a generation characterized by hard work
Or like this one
Like I don't even wonder where to hear
You don't get to wear color here apparently and HR seriously has problems with people jumping in heel I promise you that OK?
In fact we can take this generation for the term "workaholic."
I talked to an organization who recently decided against putting a ball pit in the break room because that' how you retain millennial
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast So for the first time in America' modern history we have five generation interacting at work
Or 30 not three
And in fact I know a young at the time millennial who was told that if she wanted people to take her seriously just because she was a millennial she would have to do this where shoulder pad
Yeah so -- yeah so -- yeah so -- yeah
People younger than her and older than her wouldn't take her seriously unless she wore shoulder pad
Straight out of the '80 can't even buy them anywhere shoulder pad
They appreciate competition they love effective communication
This young woman had two graduate degrees
This young woman was me
And this is the best we came up with
How to calculatee the multigenerational workplace as shoulder pave
(Applause)
So this is also what I've learned talking organizations that employ a wide range of people of various age
We are so much more similar than we are different
And we're hearing this consistently
People want work that matter they want flexibility they want support they want appreciation they want better coffee
But none of these things are tied to a generation
Now sure we see small difference in what people want
We know 20-year-old and 60-year-old go home and do different things
And they're thinking towards retirement if they haven't retired already
They have different values
At least when it comes to things happening outside of work
But I think what' happened is that this focus on generational cohort these groups of people has created a space where we've just forgot that people are people
And to know who they really are who we really work with we have to figure out how to better calculatee this multigenerational workplace than ball pit
Call me one of those idealist millennial but I think we can get there
And I don't think the idea is too executive difficult
What if we radically simply not easily meet people where they are?
Individualize our approach
I've never met a generation
I've had a lot of conversation with people who happen to identify with a specific generational cohort
Generation X is known as the Lot Generation or the Latch Key Generation born between 1961 and 1980
I know that 80-year-old text message in 23-year-old crochet blankets
None of these things are stereotypical of that generation right?
Emergent she' a thought leader in innovation she tell us we have to meet people in their onlyness that is that spot in the world where only we stand as a function of our unique history our experience and our hope
But this require flexibility and curiosity
And what happens when we meet people in their onlyness only the spot in the world that they stand we learned that that boomer who' just acting angry at work all the time is scared
Because he' worked every day since he was 16 years old and in a Monday sooner than he can imagine he'll never go to work again
It' got plan
It' going to take like a week and a half to do all the things on that -- got retirement list
But then what?
What if we give a little bit of grace to the person that might be a little scared?
Or that generation exer who has four drop-off three kids two hands and is just trying to keep the wheel on the bus
Sure maybe she' a little a loose at work
This is the smallest generation the image between boomers and the big millennial
Maybe she' a little independent maybe she' contributioned
Or that millennial who ask for a raise after two months because they're entitled
Well maybe it' because that generation has more debt than any generation before them coming out of college and they just need the money to keep going to pay rent
And suddenly when you meet people in their onlyness that spot in the world only they stand we're not talking about a generation anymore
We're talking about Jim or Jen or Candice
And so here' my challenge to us
Pick a person just one and explore their onlyness
And to learn
And then in the moment where it' appropriate teach
And figure out what they bring to work that no one else can bring to work because that' what makes work richer
And then do it again
Until it again until it again
And then someday we're not working with generation anymore
We're working with people
And so to really understand the beauty of the multigenerational workplace I think we just have to meet people where they are
And it doesn't require that we unpack and live there with them
More parents were divorced in this generation than any generation prior
But we might find at least on occasion it' a beautiful place to visit
And so I think there' just no need to argue about which generation is the most angry or the most entitle or the most so obsessed with food
We all come to the classroom to work back to our home a little bit tired and a little bit tattered sometimes
Maybe let' just to our best to humbly meet people where they are how they show up that day generation and all
And in most moment where it can feel a little bit like intergenerational warfare I think we can at least all agree that shoulder pad aren't the solution
(Applause)
They also are the first generation to tell us about work-life balance and the first to really ask for that in the workplace
And then millennial you know the everybody gets a ribbbon generation born between 1981 and 2000
Never knew a time where technology wasn't present in the home
They're incredibly pragmatic they're hopeful and they're determined
They think they're going to change the world in fact I believe they're going to do it
They might be a little bit idealistic sometimes but in just the last several years we've seen millennial overtake generation X to be the most represented generation in the workforce
But if the ray travel at a shallow angle it’ll bend so far that it stay trapped bouncing along inside the glass
Under the right condition something normally transparent to light can instead hide it from the world
Compared to electricity or radio fiber optic signal barely degrade over great distance a little power does scatter away and fiber can't bend too sharply otherwise the light leak out
Today a single optical fiber carries many wavelength of light each a different channel of data
And a fiber optic cable contain hundreds of these fiber strand
Over a million kilometers of cable Chris crosses our ocean floor to link the continent— that’ enough to wind around the equator nearly 30 times
With fiber optic distance hardly limit data which has allowed the Internet to evolve into a planetary computer
Increasingly our mobile work and play rely on lesions of overworked computer servers warehoused in gigantic data center flung across the world
This is called cloud computing and it lead to two big problems: heat waste and bandwidth demand
The vast majority of Internet traffic shuttles around inside data center where thousands of servers are connected by traditional electrical cable
Half of their running power is wasted as heat
Eventually wireless bandwidth demand steadily marche on and the gigahertz signal used in our mobile device are reaching their data delivery limit
It seems fiber optic has been too good for it own good fueling overly ambitious cloud and mobile computing expectations
But a related technology integrated photonic has come to the rescue
Light can be errord not only in optical fiber but also in ultrathin silicon wire
Silicon wire don’t error light as well as fiber
But they do enable engineer to shrink all the device in a hundred kilometer fiber optic network down to tiny photonic chip that plug into servers and convert their electrical signal to optical and back
This wasn't just any cable
These electricity-to-light chip allow for wasteful electrical cable in data center to be swapped out for power-efficient fiber
It was a souped-up version of fiber optic the hidden network that link our planet and makes the Internet pop
Photonic chip can help break open wireless bandwidth limitations too
Researchers are working to replace mobile gigahertz signal with terahertz frequencies to carry data thousands of times faster
But these are short-range signal they get absorbed by moisture in the air or blocked by tall building
With tiny wireless-to-fiber photonic transmitter chip distributed throughout cities terahertz signal can be relayed over long-range distance
They can do so via a stable middleman optical fiber and make hyper-fat wireless connectivity a reality
For all of human history light has gifted us with sight and heat serving as a steady companion while we explored and settled the physical world
Now we’ve saddled light with information and redirected it to run along a fiber optic superhighway with many different integrated photonic exit to build an even more expanive virtual world
For decades long-distance communication between cities and countries were carried by electrical signal in wire made of copper
In 2012 a team of Japanese and Danish researchers set a world record transmitting one petabit of data that’ 10,000 hours of high-death video over a 50-kilometer cable in a second
This was slow and inefficient with metal wire limiting data rate and power lost as wasted
But in the late 20th century engineer mastered a far superior method of MRI
Instead of metal glass can be carefully melted and drawn into flexible fiber strand hundreds of kilometers long and no thicker than human hair
And instead of electricity these strand carry pulse of light representing digital data
But how does light travel within glass rather than just pass through it?
The trick lie in a succeed known as total internal reflection
Since Iaac Newton’ time lensmaker and scientists have known that light bend when it passes between air and materials like water or glass
When a ray of light inside glass hit it surface at a steep angle it refract or bend as it exit into air
Crat dozen of short stories nevela and poem often take place in the same fictional continuity with recurring character location and mythology
At first glamp they appear to be set within Lovecraft’ contemporary New England
But intuitive the surface of this seemingly similar reality lie dark master for whom Earth' mushroomant are mere plaything
More like primordial force than mere deities Lovecraft’ great old one lurk at the corner of our reality
Being such as yogathroth who froth as primal slime in nuclear chaos beyond the nevermot outpot of space and time or the blind idiot god as a thought whose detructive impulse are stalled only by the maddening beating of vile drone and the thin monotonous wine of a curt flute their true form as incrutable as their motable as their motivero
By now these have become standard elements in many modern horror stories
Lovecraft’ protagonists often researchers anthropologist or antiquarian stumble onto hint of their existence
But even these indirect glimpse are enough to drive them inane
And if they survive the readers left with no feeling of triumph only cosmic indifference the terrible sense that we are but inignificant speck at the mercy of unfathomable force
But perhaps the greatest power these creature had was their appeal to Lovecraft’ contemporaries
But they were largely popularized by a single author one whose name has become an adjective for the particular type of terror he inspired
During his lifetime Lovecraft glaciered with other writer encouraging them to employ elements and character from his stories in their own
Reference to love craftian god or a cane tone can be found in many stories by his pen pal such as Robert E Howard and Robert Block
Today this shared universe is called the Kathulu Mythos named after Lovecraft’ infamous blend of dragon and octopus
Unfortunately Lovecraft’ fear of the unknown found a less savory expression in his personal view
The author helped strong racist view and some of his works include crude stereotype and slurs
But the rich world he created would outlive his personal prejudice
And after Lovecraft’ death the Cthulhu Mythos was adopted by a wide psycho of author often reimagining them from diverse perspective that transcend the author’ prejudice
Despite his literary legacy Lovecraft was never able to find financial success
He died unknown and penniless at the age of 46 a victim of the universe’ cosmic indifference
But his work has inspired numerous short stories novel tabletop games and cultural icon
And as long as humans feel a sense of dread about our unknown future Lovecraftian horror will have a place in the darkest corner of our imagination
Born in Providence Rod Island in 1890 Howard Minister Lovecraft grew up admiring the Gothic horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe and Robert Chamber
But by the time he began writing in 1917 World War I had cast a long murder over the art
People had seen real horror and were no longer frightened of fantastical folkloor
Lovecraft sought to invent a new kind of terror one that responded to the rapid scientific progress of his era
His stories often used scientific elements to lend eerie plausibility
In the color out of space a strange meteorite fall near a farmhouse mutating the farm into a nightmarish healthcare
Other incorporated scientific methodology into their form
Arcane books up forbidden law strategiesing secret in the family bloodline and terror so unpeakable the very thought of them might drive you mad
At the mountain of madness is written as a report of an Antarctic magnitude that on Earth' things better left undicovered
In others mathematics natural become a source of horror as impossible geometric configurations wreak havoc on the mind of any who behold them
Like then-recent discoveries of subatomic particles or X-ray the force in Lovecraft’ fiction were powerful yet often invisible and indecribable
Rather than recognizable monster graphic violence or startling shock the terror of love-grafting horror lie in what' not directly portrayed but left instead to the dark depth of our imagination
Thank you
And I was never particularly good at the violin but I used to sit at the back of the second violin section in the hasting' youth orchestra scratching away
We were all scratching and marveling at this symphonic sound that we were making that was so much more beautiful and powerful than anything we would ever have managed on our own
And now as I create large-scale performance I'm always working with team that are at least the size of a symphony orchestra
And whether we are creating these revolving giant ches piece time tunnel for an opera by Richard Wagner or shark tank and mountain for Khanye West we're always seeking to create the most articulate sculpture the most poetic instrument of communication to an audience to an audience
When I say poetic I just mean language at it most condened like a song lyric a poetic puzzle to be unlocked and unpacked
These are sequence from a plane called the Lehman Trilogy which trace the origin of Western capitalism in three hours with three actors and a piano
And when we were preparing to design Beyonc vaccine' formation tour we looked at all the lyric and we came across this poem that Beyonc vaccine wrote
I saw a TV creature when I was scared at four or five about bad dream who promised he'd say a prayer if I put my hand to the TV -- that' the first time I remember prayer as an electric current running through me
And this TV that transmitted prayer to Beyonc vaccine as a child became this: monolithic revolving sculpture that broadcast Beyonc vaccine to the back of the stadium
And the stadium is a mass congregation
It' a episode population of 100,000 people who've all come there to sing along with every word together but they've also come there each seeking one-to-one intimacy with the performer
And we as we conceive the show we have to provide intimacy on a grand scale
It usually start with sketches
I was drawing this 60-foot-high revolving broadcast quality portrait of the artist and then I tore the piece of paper in half
I split the mask to try to access the human underneath it all
And my role was to create a stage design to write a visual language for this work
I call my work stage sculpture but of course what' really being sculpted is the experience of the audience and as director and designers we have to take responsibility for every minute that the audience spend with us
With a bit like pilot calculateing a flight path for 100,000 passenger
And in the case of the Canadian artist the weekend we translated this flight path literally into an origami paper folding airplane that took off over the head of the audience broke apart in mid-flight complications and then rose out of the ashe restored at the end of the show
And like any flight the most delicate part is the liftoff the beginning because when you design a pop concert the prime material that you're working with is something that doesn't take truck or crew to transport it
It doesn't cost anything and yet it fill every atom of air in the arena before the show start
It' the audience' anticipation
Everyone bring with them the story of how they came to get there the distance they traveled the months they had to work to pay for the ticket
The play describe Atlantic crossing Alabama cotton field New York skyline and we framed the whole thing within this single revolving cube a kind of kinetic cinema through the centuries
Sometimes they sleep overnight outside the arena and our first task is to deliver for an audience on their anticipation to deliver their first sight of the performer
When I work with men they're quite happy to have their music transformed into metaphor spaceflight mountain
But with women we work a lot with mask and with three-dimensional portraiture because the fan are the female artist crave her face
And when the audience arrived to see Adeal' first live concert in five years they were met with this image of her eyes a sleep
If they listened carefully they would hear her sleeping breath echoing around the arena waiting to wake up
Here' how the show began
You're at TED You're not here today too
And we're calculateing the audience over a terrain that span three decades of politics poetry and music
And over many months meeting with the band and their creative team this is the sketch that kept recurring this line this past with their present the tight rope that they walk as activist and artist a walk through cinema that allows the band to become protagonists in their own poetry
It' an arrival or it' an arrival
It' a transfer from the stage out to the audience
For the British band taken that we ended the show by sending an 80-foot-high mechanical human figure out to the center of the crowd
Like many translation from music to mechanics this one was initially deemed entirely technically impossible
The first three engineer we took it to said "No and eventually the way that it was achieved was by keeping the entire control system together while it toured around the country so we had to fold it up onto a flat bed truck so it could tore around without coming apart."
And of course what this meant was that the dimension of it head was entirely determined by the lowest motorway bridge that it had to travel under on it tour
It' like a musical instrument played by three performers
And I have to tell you that it turns out there is an unavoidable and annoyingly low bridge just outside Hamburg
(Applause)
All of the most technically complex pieces that we've worked on is the opera "Carmon" at Bregen' Festival in Austria
We enviaged Carmen' hands rising out of late constant and throwing this deck of card in the air and leaving them suspended between sky and sea
But this transient senior this flick of the wrist had to become a structure that would be strong enough to withtand two Austrian winter
So there' an awful lot that you don't see in this photograph that' working really hard
And as they step their way around and through the lives of the Lehman brother we the audience begin to connect with the simple human origin at the root of the complex global financial systems that we're all still in thrall to today
It' a lot of ballast and structure and support around the back and I'm going to show you the photo that aren't on my website
There are photo of the back of a set the part that' not designed for the audience to see how of much work it' doing
And you know this is actually the dilemma for an artist who is working as a stage designer because so much of what I make is fake it' an illusion
And yet every artist works in pursuit of communicating something that' true
But we are always asking ourselves "Can we communicate truth using things that are false?"
And now when I attend the shows that I've worked on I often find I'm the only one who' not looking at the stage
I'm looking at something that I find equally as fascinating and it' the audience
You want to ask you what this is
This many humans connected focused undistracted and unfolded
And lately I've begun to make work that originate here in the collective voice of the audience
Poem portrait is a collective poem
It began at the Serpentine Gallery in London and everybody is invited to donate one word to a collective poem
And instead of that large single LED portrait that was broadcasting to the back of the stadium in this case every member of the audience gets to take their own portrait home with them and it' woven in with the words that they've contributed to the collective poem
So they keep a fragment of an ever-evolving collective work
And next year the collective poem will take architectural form
This is the design for the UK Pavilion at the World Expo 2020
The UK
In my lifetime it' never felt this divided
It' never felt this noisy with divergent voice
And it' never felt this much in need of places where voice might connect and converge
And it' my hope that this wooden sculpture this wooden instrument a bit like that violin I used to play might be a place where people can play and end to their word at one end of the cone emerge at the other end of the building and find that their word has joined a collective poem a collective voice
These are simple experiment in machine learning
The algorithm that generate the collective poem is pretty simple
It' like predictive text only it' trained on millions of words written by poet in the 19th century
I used to play musical instrument myself when I was younger
So it' a sort of convergence of intelligence past and present organic and inorganic
And we were inspired by the words of Stephen Hawking
Toward the end of his life he asked quite a simple question: If we as a species were ever to come across another advanced life-form an advanced civilization how would we speak to them?
What collective language would we speak as a planet?
The language of light reaches every audience
All of us are touched by it none of us can hold it
My favorite was the violin
And in the theater we begin each work in a dark place devoid of light
We stay up all night focusing the light programming the light trying to find new ways to sculpt and carve light
This is a portrait of our practice always seeking new ways to shape and rehape light always finding words for things that we no longer need to say
And I want to say that this and everything that I've just shown you no longer exist in physical form
It was this intimate transfer of energy
In fact most of what I've made over the last 25 years doesn't exist anymore
But our work endure in memories in synaptic sculpture in the mind of those who were once present in the audience
I once read that a poem learned by heart is what you have left what can't be lost even if your house burn down and you've lost all your possessions
You held this organic sculpture up to your heart and you poured the energy of your whole body into this little piece of wood and heard it translated into music
I want to end with some lines that I learned by heart a long time ago
They're written by the English novelist EM Forster in 1910 just a few years before Europe my continent
(Applause)
Again tearing itself a parliament
And his call to convergence still resonate through most of what we're trying to make now
Only connect was the whole of her sermon only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exulted and human love will be seen at it height only connect and live in fragment no longer
On the most complex cognitive and motor task that we do as human being
Now imagine talking to yourself without vocalizing without moving your mouth without moving your job but by simply articulating those words internally
Thereby very subtly engaging your internal speech systems such as your tongue and back of the palate
Ever since computers are invented we've been trying to make them smarter and more powerful
When that happens the brain send extremely weak signal to these internal speech systems
AlterEgo has sensor embedded in a thin plastic flexible and transparent device that sit on your neck just like a sticker
These sensor pick up on these internal signal source deep within the mouth cavity right from the surface of the skin
An AI program running in the background then tries to figure out what the users try to say
It then feed back an answer to the user by means of bone conduction audio conducted through the skull into the users in an ear that the user hear overlaid on top of the users' themselves hearing of the environment without blocking it
The combination of all these parts the input the output and the AI gives a net subjective experience of an interface inside your head that you could talk to in likeness to talking to yourself
From the abacus to room-ized machines to desktop to computers in our pocket
Just to be very clear the device does not record or read your thought
It record enzyme information that you want to communicate through enzyme engagement of your internal speech systems
People don't want to be read they want to write
Which is why we designed the system to enzymely record from the peripheral nervous system
Which is why the control in all situation reside for the user
I want to stop here for a second and show you a live demo
What I'm going to do is I'm going to ask Eric a question
And he' going to search for that information without vocalizing without typing without moving his finger without moving his mouth
Simply by internally asking that question
The AI would then figure out the answer and feed it back to Eric through audio through the device
While you see a laptop in front of him he' not using it
Everything lives on the device
All he needs is that sticker device to interface with the AI and the Internet
And are now designing artificial intelligence to automate task that would require human intelligence
So Eric what' the weather in Vancouver like right now?
What you see on the screen is the words are the words that Eric is speaking to himself right now
This is happening in real time
It' 50 degrees in rainy here in Vancouver
What happened is that the AI sent the answer through audio through the device back to Eric
What could the implication of something like this be?
Imagine perfectly memorizing things where you perfectly record information that you silently speak and then cure them later when you want to internally searching for information crunching numbers at speed computers do silently texting other people
Suddenly becoming multilingual so that you internally speak in one language and hear the translation in your head another
The potential could be far reaching
If you look at the history of computing we've always treated computers as external device that compute and act on our behalf
There are millions of people around the world who struggle with using themselves speech
People with conditions such as ALS or Lou Gehrig' disease stroke and oral cancer amongt many other conditions
For them communicating is a paintakingly slow and a tiring process
This is Doug
Doug was diagnosed with ALS about 12 years ago and has since lost the ability to speak
Today he use an on-creen keyboard where he types in individual letter using his head movement
And it takes several minutes to communicate a single sentence
So we went to Doug and asked him what would the first words he'd like to use or say using our system?
Perhaps a greeting like "Hello how are you?"
Or indicate that he needed help with something
What Doug said that he wanted to use our system for is to reboot the old system he had because that' all system kept on crashing
We never could have predicted that
I'm going to show you a short clip of Doug using our system for the first time
We will picture it
What you just saw there was dog communicating or speaking in real time for the first time since he lost the ability to speak
There are millions of people who might be able to communicate in real time like Doug with other people with their friends and with their families
What I want to do is I want to weave computing AI and Internet as part of us
My hope is to be able to help them express their thought and ideas
I believe computing AI and the Internet would trouble into us as extension of our cognition instead of being external entities or adveraries amplifying human ingenuity giving us unimaginable abilities and unlocking our true potential
And perhaps even freeing us to becoming better at being human
Thank you so much
(Applause)
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK
I want to ask you a couple of questions They're going to clear the stage
I feel like this is amazing it' innovative it' creepy it' stimulate
Can you tell us what I think?
I think there are some rebuild feeling around this
As part of human cognition freeing us to interact with the world around us
Tell us is this reading your thought will it in five years is there a weaponized version of this what does it look like?
CA: So our first design principle before we started working on this was to not render ethic as an afterthought
So we wanted a big ethic right in with the design
We flipped the design
Instead of reading from the brain directly we're reading from the voluntary nervous system that you enzymely have to engage to communicate with the device while still bringing the benefit of a thinking or a thought device
So it bring the best part of both world in a way
CA: OK I think we're going to have a lot more questions for you
Also you said that it' a sticker
So right now it' just right here
I that the final iteration what the final design you hope looks like?
Our goal is for the technology to trouble completely
Integrate human and machine intelligence right inside our own bodies to augment us instead of diminishing us or replacing us
So it goes
If you're wearing it I shouldn't be able to see it
You don't want technology on your face you want it in the background to augment you in the background
So we have a sticker version that conform to the skin that looks like the skin where we're trying to make an even smaller version that would sit right here
EM: OK
I feel like as anyone have any questions they want to do and he'll be here all week
OK thank you so much Thank you so much Thank you so much Thank you so much
That' very straightforward That' based on that
Could we combine what people do best such as creative andsufficient thinking with what computers do best such as processing information and perfectly memorizing stuff?
Could this whole be better than the sum of it parts?
We have a device that could make that possible
It' called AlterEgo and it' a wearable device that gives you the experience of a conversational AI that lives inside your head that you could talk to in likeness you're talking to yourself internally
We have a new prototype that we're showing here for the first time at TED and here' how it works
Normally when we speak the brain send neural signal through the nerve to your internal speech systems to activate them and your vocal cord to produce speech
(Applause)
Here' a photo of me after having kids
A broken defeated husk of a man
(Applause)
Here' the photo of the car I thought I'd be driving as an adult
I'm an contributionive TED
A porch
Here' what I actually drive
A Honda Odyey minivan
Or the main event
Where there was one' hope now there is dictator space and good mileage good mileage
Now I just want to stress that I'm completely aware of the very dire threat of global warming and climate change
Currently owned and dominated by two many iPod who rule my life with an iron fist while wearing their Hugggies diapers
I just want to acknowledge that aggressive to have babies is a deeply profoundly personal choice
And that many who want to are unable
But just for today let' examine the flip side of the coin
At how not having enough new people is going to be a major problem moving forward
According to the World Health Organization we need to average about 21 children per woman today just so we have enough people to replace the previous generation
A lot of you thought overpopulation was going to be a problem in 100 years yet it might be underprivileged
So a question: What happens if that number dip below 21?
There' going to be a domino effect
As all of us get older and live longer there' going to be a shrinking younger population which is going to lead to rising labor shortage in the world' biggest economy
I'm talking my United States China Japan Germany
Fewer younger working people means less tax room
Le tax revenue means less money and resources to go to safe net program that all of us are going to depend upon
I'm talking about penions and health care
It seems every generation is indeed connected
But how the heck did we get here in the first place?
Well in some cases it was intentional
Let' take the DeLorean to simpler times
Let' stop in China
Somewhere between the death of disco and empire strike back 1980
In 1980 China decided to implement the one-child policy largely limiting most parents to having just one kid to combat overpopulation
Check out some good old-fashioned Chinese prop again that lovely
Now fast forward to 2019
Now probably because I've been drowning in small people lately I've been paying close attention to a particular headline
Even after ending it one child policy in 2015 China' birth rate have largely declined
In fact the falling population in China is removing one of it biggest driver of growth -- people
If trend continue China' population is actually going to peak in 2029 before entering quote untoppable decline
China' government is so freaked out right now that it' actually doing new propaganda: it' begging couple to have children for the country
Let' take the DeLorean and hop over to Japan home of my beloved Honda Odyey minivan
Japan is now producing more adult diapers than infant one
The number of kids in Japan has fallen for the 37th straight year
And unlike other countries it has not been able to replace it population numbers through immigrant workers
There will be labor shortage and not enough money to fund the safety of program
It seems around the world in developed countries people are having fewer babies
Now Japan has introduced two solutions
First a financial incentive
Some local government in Japan have offered couple money to have babies with the money increasing with each additional child being born
This actually worked for one year in 2014 in this town called Ama
It actually raised the birth rate from about 16 kids per woman to 18
But it did not gain traction across Japan
In 2018 a leader of Japan' ruling party tried a new tag
He told young people "You're selfish for not having babies."
Shockingly shaming was not a rousing aphrodiiac
Surprise I know Supprise I know Suppprise I know Supprise I know Suppprise I not Supprise I not Suppprise I not Supppprise I not Supppprise I not Suppprise I not Supppriize I not Suppprise surprise I not Suppprise surprise I not
Who is heart? Who is heart?
Let' take the DeLorean to Europe the continent of satisfy cheese I love to eat but cannot pronounce
From North America to Europe to China to Japan there' actually been a consistent decline in birth rate
The UK and much of Western Europe has a birth rate of about 17 kids per woman which at least is better than Hungary where it hover around 145
Now Hungary' Prime Indonesia Victor Orban has proposed a new solution to try to incentivize people to have kids
He said families where the women have four or more kids will no longer pay income tax
Pretty good right? Right? Pretty good Right? Pretty good
At least as better than rushes 2007 proposal which once offered women in a particular region the opportunity of winning a fridge if they had more kids
(Applause)
Yeah it didn't work It didn't work It didn't work
But hold on pump the break
Orbin is primarily proposing this because he want to limit the population of Muslim and people of color
He says he doesn't think Hungary' tradition and culture and color has to be quote mixed with those of others
Sedle settled settled
Unfortunately for urban and much of the EU the birth rate are not high enough right now to be replenished without immigration
In fact over the past 50 years the global fertility rate has halved
Among EU countries there is a overwhelming decline
So it seems in Europe Karma is going to be brown and Muslim
(Applause)
Just think I'm just thinking I'm just thinking just think what' just thinking?
The question remain: Why aren't people having enough kids?
Why is the birth rate declining in these countries?
In some cases it' because women are more literate more educated
They have more economic opportunities applied
All good things all good things yes
All the other
In India this has been fantastic and as I should reduce the birth rate but kept it above that magic 21 number
Women also have more access to birth control more control over their reproductive lives all good things
But in the United States in particular a lot of young people are opting out of having kids largely cite the same reason: financial Israel
Let' take the DeLorean to my motherland the United States of America where the birth rate hit it historic low in 2050
The United States is the most expensive country in the world to give birth
What the heck is going on?
If you do not have insurance it will cost you 32,000 dollars to have a baby if everything goes perfectly
That' like buying a brand new Honda Odyey minivan OK?
So congratulation just had a baby but the baby' economic productivity is zero and guess what?
Now my friends who don't want kids all point to climate change as a reason for never having babies
The United States is the only industrialized country in the world that does not require employers to offer paid parental leave
Mom you just had a baby congratulation that' loving get back to work or your fired young mom
My wife and I both working parents pay about 3,500 dollars a month a month in Virginia for childcare
If you do the math that' 40,000 dollars a year
That' like buying a brand new souped-up condom audacy minivan OK?
I have one I do not need 10
So here' my bold suggestion
Let' make it easier for people to have babies
It seems in order to invest in our future we actually have to invest in the present and help those people who want to become parents
Give them affordable health care give them affordable childcare give them paid parental leave
Among the EU state in 2017 France reported the highest birth rate
Why? Why?
Largely due to it pronatal policies that actually kept women in the workforce
I'm talking about subidized daycare and paid maternal leave
China and Japan thank God are finally wiening up and proposing such policies
This is great
That being said I know some of you have listened to me and you still think the best investment we can make in the future is not having babies
I respect that I respect that
I get where you come from
And I know many of you in this audience want to have babies but you are terrified about the future
And as a parent I feel you
I'm scared about the future
I wrote that last line a month ago
But it really hit home three days ago for me while I was at TED
Three days ago my wife call me crying
I pick it up in my hotel room
And she said "I'm calling from the hospital."
We had to take my baby daughter Nusayba who was named after a warrior prince to the hospital because she found a bump on the stomach
We got back the results and there were bump all around her liver
Today this morning we found out that she has stage four liver cancer
(Applause)
It has been a challenging week
And if I may I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the TED staff everyone top-down everyone in the back in the green room some of the speaker would have spread
On behalf of my family my wife and my parents my Pakistani parents said I had to say this: Thank you for just being decent and kind this week
So thank you thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
These are my beloved my Abraham and Noava my babies
I talked to my wife and despite the terrible news and the fight ahead we both concluded that we were getting nothing
Deciding to have babies was the best decision we ever made
Our babies have brought us so much joy and they've brought the world so much joy and having kids as a risk but life as a risk
And yes I hope you've been paying attention we need to invest in babies in developed countries if we want to help save our economy and penions
But that' not the reason you have babies
That' not the main reason
Babies have always represented humanity' best boldest most beautiful infinite possibilities
And if we in developed countries as a whole opt out and don't invest in present and future generation and what the hell' the point?
What' the point of being on this aburd journey together?
And so for those who can and who choose to for those who can and who choose to have kids may you pass on this beautiful thing called life with kindness generoity decency and love
Thank you
Our fire a train of super-short laser pulse to give depth resolution
Take the moose on the country road
As the car drive by one LIDAR pulse scatter off the base of it antler while the next may travel to the tip of one antler before bouncing back
Measuring how much longer the second pulse takes to return provide data about the antler' shape
With a lot of short pulse a LIDAR system quickly render a detailed profile
The most obvious way to create a pulse of light is to switch a laser on and off
But this makes a laser untable and affect the precise timing of it pulse which limit death resolution
Better to leave it on and use something else to periodically block the light reliably and rapidly
Suddenly three hazard appear at the same time
That' where integrated photonic come in
The digital data of the Internet is carried by precision-timed pulse of light some as short as a hundred picoa
One way to create these pulse is with a Mach-zender modulator
This device takes advantage of a particular wave property called interference
Imagine dropping pebble into a pond as the ripples spread and overlap a pattern form
What happens next?
In some places wave peak add up to become very large in other places they completely cancel out
The Mach-Zenger modulator does something similar
It split wave of light along two parallel arm and eventually rejoin them
If the light is slowed down and delayed in one arm the wave recombine out of sync and cancel blocking the light
Before it can calculatee this onlaught of obstacle the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about their size shape and position so that it control algorithm can plot the safet course
By toggling this delay in one arm the modulator act like an on-off switch emitting pulse of light
A light pulse lasting a hundred picosecond lead to a depth resolution of a few centimeter but tomorrow' cars will need to see better than that
By pairing the modulator with a super-ensitive fast-acting light detector the resolution can be refined to a millimeter
That' more than 100 times better than what we can make out with 2020 vision from across a street
The first generation of believing LIDAR has relied on complex spinning asemblie that scan from rooftop or hood
With integrated photonic modulator and detectors are being shrunk to less than a tenth of a millimeter and packed into tiny chip that are one day fit inside a car’ light
These chip will also include a clever variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts and scan at rapid speed
By slowing the light in a modulator arm only a tiny bit this additional device will act more like a dimmer than an on-off switch
If an array of many such arm each with a tiny controlled delay is stacked in parallel something novel can be designed— a steerable laser beam
From their new vantage these smart eyes will probe and see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined and help calculatee any number of obstacle
All without anyone breaking a sweat except for maybe one disoriented moose
With no human at the wheel the car needs smart eyes sensor that will symmetry these detail no matter the environment weather or how dark it is all in a split
Second that' a tall order but there' a solution that partner two things: a special kind of laser-based probe called LIDAR and a miniature version of the communication technology that keep the Internet humming called integrated photonic
To understand LIDAR it help to start with a related technology: radar
In aviation radar antenna launch pulse of radio or microwave at plane to learn their location by timing how long the beam take to bounce back
That’ a limited way of seeing though because the large beam-ize can’t visualize fine detail
It late pitch dark and a self-driving car wind down a narrow country road
In contrast a self-driving car’ LIDAR system which stand for light detection and ranging use a narrow invisible infrared laser
It can image feature as small as the button on a manuscript’ shirt across the street
But how do we determine the shape or depth of these feature?
Tell us what you really think
I'd like to have a word about valve' drawing skills
Never seen an illustration of sloth but more useless
(Applause)
He has given the sloth a remarkably human like face and sloth do have remarkably human-like face
Can I go "Can I go? Can I go? Can I go?"
This sloth I photographed in Cota Rica I think looks a lot like Ringo Starr
But then sloth do bear an uncanny reemblance to the beetle
Well I'm here to talk to you about my animal news the sloth
Particularly pleased with Paul actually on there
But like the beetle sloth are also extremely successful
They come from an ancient line of mammal and there were once dozen of species including the giant ground sloth which was the size of a small elephant and one of the only animals big enough to eat avocado pit whole and disperse them
So some of you have worked out already
That means that without sloth there might be no avocado on toast today leaving hipster everywhere totally bereft at breakfast
(Applause)
Today there are six surviving species and they fall into two groups
You've got your Bradipus three-toed sloth they're the one with the Beatles haircut and the Mona Lia smile
Then there are the two-toed sloth
They look a little bit more like a cross between a walking and a pig
They live in the rhino of Central and South America and they're extremely prolific
There was a survey that was done in the 1970 in a Panamanian tropical forest that found that sloth were the most numerically abundant large animal
They took up one quarter of the mammalian bioma
I've been documenting the strange lives of the world' slowest mammal for the last 10 years
Now that' an awful lot of sloth and suggest they're doing something very right indeed
So what if rather than deriding the sloth for being different we tried to learn from it instead?
We humans are obsessed with speed
Buiness is a badge of honor and convenience trump quality in our quet for quick
Our addiction to the express life is choking us and the planet
We idolize animals like the cheetah the Ferrari of the animal kingdom capable of doing not to 60 and three second flat
So what? The sloth
On the other hand can reach a leisurely 17 feet a minute with the wind behind it
I still remember the first time I saw one
But being fast is costly
The cheetah is speedy but at the expense of strength
They can't risk getting in a fight so they lose one in nine kill to tougher predator like hyenas
No wonder they're laughing
I was fascinated by their freaky biology
(Applause)
The sloth on the other hand has taken a more stealthy approach to dinner
They survive by capturing and conuming static leave
(Applause)
You see leave don't want to be eaten any more than antelope do so they're loaded full of toxin and very hard to digest
So in order to consume them the sloth has also had to become an athlete a digesting athlete
The sloth' secret weapon is a four-chambed stomach and plenty of time
They have the slowest digestion rate of any mammal
And it can take up to a month to process a single leaf which gives their liver plenty of time to process those toxin
So sloth are lazy
I mean what' not to love about an animal that' born with a fixed grin on it face?
No that busy
digesting
Yep really is he?
Part at work that sloth very hard at work
And of course leave have little calorific value so sloth have evolved to spend as little energy as possible
They do about 10 percent of the work of a similar-ized mammal and survive on as little as 100 calories a day thank to some ingenious adaptations
The Bradapus three-toed sloth they got more neck bone than any other mammal even a giraffe
Which means they can turn their head through 270 degrees and graze all around them without having to actually bother with the effort of moving their body
(Applause)
It also means that they are surprisingly good swimmer
Sloth can bob along in water three times faster than they can move on land kept to float by ...
Trap to win
(Applause)
It' the early mammal that we know of that don't do flatulence
When they need to expel gas it' actually reaborbed into their bloodstream and expelled orally as a sort of mouth fart
It' the need to hug
Turning their lives upside down save further energy
They have about half the skeletal muscle of a terrestrial mammal
They don't really have so many of the extensor muscle that are the weight-bearing muscle instead they rely on retractor muscle to pull natural along
They have long hooked claw and a high fatigue resistance so they can literally hook on and hang like a happy hairy hammock for hours on end
And soft can do almost anything in this inverted position
They sleep eat and even give birth
Their throat and blood vessel are uniquely adapted to pump blood and to storytelling food against the force of gravity
Sloth are massively misunderstood
They have sticky bit on their rib that prevent their enormous stomach from crashing their lung
And their fur grow the opposite direction so they can drip dry after a tropical drenching
The only problem is if you turn a sloth the other way up gravity remove it dignity
(Applause)
They literally -- they can't hold natural upright
And so they drag their bodies along as if mountaineering on a flat surface
And I think this is why the early explorers like Valdez thought so poorly of them because they were oberving sloth the wrong way up and out of context
They've been saddled with a name that speak of sin and dammmed for their language lifestyle which people seem to think has no place amongt the fittest in the fast-paced race for survival
I've spent many happy hours memerized by moving
The lack of muscle hasn't impeded their strength or agility
Nature' zen master of mellow move like swan lake in slow-mo
With the core control of a tyche master
This one has fallen neuroscientist mid-mov which is not on common
But you're probably wondering how does a dangling bag of digesting leave avoid being eaten?
Good question
Well this is one of the sloth-main predator
It can fly at speed of up to 50 miles per hour has talon the size of a grizzly bear' razor-sharp eyesight and that ring of feather focuses sound so that it can hear the slightest leaf rustle
The sloth on the other hand has poor hearing bad eyesight and running from danger is clearly not an option
No they survive by wearing an inviibility cloak worthy of Harry Potter
Their fur has groove that attract moisture and act as tiny hydroponic garden for algae and they also attract a host of invertebrate
So they are their own slow-moving miniature ecosystem
They become one with the trees
And we think that their movement are so slow they slip under the radar of the montrous harpy as it' flying about the canopy scanning for action
Sloth are stealth ninja and they rarely leave the safety of the canopy except to defecate which they do about once a week at the base of a tree
Now this risky and energetic behavior has long been a mystery and there are lots of theories as to why they do it
But I think they're leaving surreptitious sentient message for potential mate
Because you see sloth are generally silent solitary creature except for when the female is in heat
Well I'm here to tell you that we've got this animal all wrong and how understanding the truth about the sloth may help save us and this planet we both call home
She will climb to the top of a tree and CEO for sex
In D-sharp
Don't believe me
(Applause)
De shop
This and only this note will get the male' attention
It mimic the sound of the Kikadi flycatche
So the female remain covered even when yodeling for sex at the top of her lung
Her clandestine booty call will carry for miles across the canopy and male will beat a slow path towards her
I think sended message in her dung will help send Romeo up the right tree so that he doesn't waste precious energy scaling the wrong one
Sex by the way is the only thing that sloth do swiftly
I've seen them do it in the wild and it' over and done within a matter of second
But then why waste precious energy on it particularly after that journey?
Unlike other mammal sloth don't also waste time maintaining a constant warm body temperature
Energy from the sun is free so they bak in the sun like lizard and wear an unusually thick hope for the tropic to keep that heat in
Sloth have a freakishly low metabolism
And we think that this might be one of the reasons that they can sometimes recover from injuries that would kill most animals
This sloth recovered from a double amputation and I've seen an manufacture sloth that have managed to survive even power-line electrocutions
And we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction
Researchers at Kanas University who were studying mollusk found that a high metabolism predicted which species of mollusk had gone extinct
Sloth have been around on this planet in one shape or another for over 40 million years
The secret to their success is their slothful nature
They are energy-aving icon
And I founded the Sloth Appreciation Society to both promote and protect their slow steady sustainable lives
I traced stuff-based slander back to a Spanish conquitador called Valdez who gave the first disgust of a sloth in his encyclopedia of the New World
I'm a pretty speedy character
I'm sure you've guessed
And the sloth have taught me a lot about slowing down
And I think that the planet would benefit if we all took a slowly digested leaf out of their book
How about we all embrace our inner sloth by slowing down being more mindful reducing wasteful convenience being economical with our energy recycling creatively and reconnecting with nature?
Otherwise I fear it will be us humans that turn out to be the stupidest animals that can be found in the world
Thank you very much
Maybe it' happy
He said "The sloth was the stupidest animal that can be found in the world I have never seen such an ugly animal or one that is more useless."
If enough sensor are activated electrical signal shoot up the nerve to the spine and on to the brain
The brain weigh the importance of these signal and produce pain if it decide the body needs protection
Typically pain help the body avoid further injury or damage
But there are a whole set of factor beside nociception that can influence the experience of pain and make pain less useful
First there are biological factor that amplify nociceptive signal to the brain
If nerve fiber are activated repeatedly the brain may decide they need to be more sensitive to adequately protect the body from threat
He accidentally jumped onto a 15 centimeter mail which pierced straight through his steel-toed boot
More stress sensor can be added to nerve fiber until they become so sensitive that even light touches to the skin spark intense electrical signal
In other cases nerve adapt to send signal more efficiently amplifying the message
These form of amplification are most common in people experiencing chronic pain which is defined as pain lasting more than three months
When the nervous system is nudged into an ongoing state of high alert pain can outlat physical injury
This create a vicious cycle in which the longer pain persist the more difficult it becomes to reverse
Pychological factor clearly play a role in pain too potentially by influencing nociception and by influencing the brain directly
A person’ emotional state memories belief about pain and expectations about treatment can all influence how much pain they experience
In one study children who reported excitement that they had no control over pain actually experienced more intense pain than those who believed they had some control
Feature of the environment matter too in one experiment monitor with a cold rod placed on the back of their hand reported feeling more pain when they were shown a red light than a blue one even though the rod was the same temperature each time
He was in such agonizing pain that even the smallest movement was unbearable
Finally social factor like the availability of family support can affect perception of pain
All of this means that a multi-pronged approach to pain treatment that include pain specialists physical therapist clinical psychologist nurse and other healthcare professional is often most effective
We’re only beginning to uncover the mechanism behind the experience of pain but there are some promiing areas of research
Until recently we thought the glial cells surrounding neurons were just support structure but now we know they have a huge role in in influencing nociception
Studies have shown that disabling certain brain circuit in the amygdala can eliminate pain in rat
But when the doctors took off his boot they faced a surprising sight: the nail had never touched his foot at all
And genetic testing in people with rare disorder that prevent them from feeling pain have pinpointed several other possible target for drugs and perhaps eventually gene therapy
For hundreds of years scientists thought that pain was a direct response to damage
By that logic the more severe an injury is the more pain it should cause
But as we've learned more about the science of pain we've discovered that pain and tissue damage don't always go hand in hand even when the body' threat signaling mechanism are fully functioning
We are capable of experiencing severe pain out of proportion to an actual injury and even pain without any injury like the builder or the well-documented cases of male partner of pregnant women experiencing pain during the pregnancy or labor
In 1995 the British medical journal published an facility report about a 29-year-old builder
What' going on here?
There are actually two recruit at play: the experience of pain and a biological process called nociception
Nociception is part of the nervous system’ protective response to harmful or potentially harmful stimuli
Sensors in specialized nerve ending detect mechanical thermal and chemical threat
In humans this lens is curved to process light wave traveling through air
But sea lions need to see their best at hundreds of meters deep
To accommodate their eyes have a much rounder lens to refract light underwater as well as teardrop-haped pupil which can expand to 25 times their original size
Sunning natural on rock or waddling awkwardly across the beach it' easy to think of these immobile mammal less as sea lions and more as sea house cat
This let in as much light as possible helping them pinpoint their prey in dealing with dimmest conditions
But once they’ve closed in they rely on something akin to a sixth sense to actually catch their meal
Their whisker or vibration are composed of keratin and full of nerve fiber that run deep into the connective tissue of their face
Sea lions have full directional control over these whisker which can lie flat against their face or stick out at a 90-degree angle
When properly tuned these whisker can sense the slim trail of moving water that fish leave in their wake
And they’re precise enough to let blindfolded sea lions tell the difference between objects less than two centimeter different in size
With these tools a healthy sea lion can catch generous helping of fish such as anchrovie macroll and squid on every outing
And with their exceptional memories they can remember multiple hunting ground including those they haven’t visited in decades
This memory also extend to breeding territories and birthing areas as well as which neighbor are friend and foe
There' even evidence that sea lions can remember how to perform task after 10 years with no practice in between letting them calculatee old-tomping ground with ease
Yet despite these incredible adaptations there are changes in folding in their habitat too rapidly for sea lions to handle
As climate change warm the ocean certain toxic algae species thrive
But don't be fooled by their beachside behavior
This algae is harmless to the fish who eat it but for the sea lions that ingest those fish the algae’ demoic acid can escape seizure and brain damage
Changing ocean conditions keep the algae blooming year round causing more and more sea lions to wash up on beaches
This tragic discovery is just one of the many ways the health of aquatic animal communities can help us better understand Earth' ocean
These red flag help us take action to protect ourselves and other maritime mammal
Under the wave sea lions are incredible endurance hunters
And the more we can learn about the changing ocean that sea lions mushroom the better equipped will be to help these clever creature thrive
Heartling around at speed from four to 18 miles an hour and hunting for up to 30 hours at a time these majetic mammal live up to their name
And thank to a suite of physical adaptations finally tuned over millions of years they make for resourceful foragers
To find their favorite food sea lions hunt much deeper than many of their semiaquatic peer
With some species diving to depth of nearly 400 meters they're able to cope with the mounting pressure by collaping their pliable rib cage and compressing a pair of springy lung
This pushes air up through the smaller airway collaping ring of cartilage as oxygen travel out from the lung to be held in the larger upper airway
Upon surfacing this air will be used to re-inflate the lung but for now their heart slow down to preserve oxygen
Blood flow is redirected towards only the most essential organ like the heart lung and right which rely on reserve oxygen stored in blood and muscle
Once they arrive at their hunting ground sea lions depend on their superior vision to find their prey
This mammal eyes have a structure called a lens a transparent convex structure whose shape refract light to enable sight
"OK so you want me to do it in Spanish I ask."
No no do it in English just sound Latina
Well I am a Latina so isn't this what a Latina sounds like?
On the red tile in my family' den I would dance and sing to the made for TV movie "Gypy," starring Bette Midler
There was a long and awkward silence and then finally "OK sweetie never mind thank you for coming in by!"
It took me most of the car right home to realize that by sound more Latina she was asking me to speak in broken English
And I couldn't figure out why the fact that I was an actual real-life authentic Latina didn't really seem to matter
Anyway I didn't cook the job
I didn't get a lot of the jobs people were willing to see me for the gang-banger' girlfriend the say shop lifter pregnant chola number two
These were the kinds of role that existed for someone like me
Someone they looked at and saw as too brown too fat too poor too unophisticated
These role were stereotype and couldn't have been further from my own reality or from the role I drempt of play
I wanted to play people who were complex and multi-dimensional people who existed in the center of their own lives
Not cardboard cutout that stood in the background of someone else'
But when I dared to say that to my manager -- that' the person I pay to help me find opportunity -- his response was "Someone has to tell that girl she has unrealistic expectations."
And he wasn't wrong
I mean I fired him but he wasn't wrong
I had a tree a wonderful dream pop-up
Because whatever I did try to get a role that wasn't a poorly written stereotype I would hear we're not looking to cast this role diversely
Or we love her but she' too specifically ethnic
Or unfortunately we already have one Latino in this movie
I kept receiving the same message again and again and again and again
That my identity was an obstacle I had to overcome
And so I thought "Come at me obstacle I'm an American My name is a merit I train my whole life for this I'll just follow the playbook I'll work harder."
And so I did I worked my hardest to overcome all the things that people said were wrong with me
I stayed out at the sun so that my skin wouldn't get too brown I straightened my curl into submiion
I would sing it with the urgency and the burning desire of a nine-year-old who did in fact have a dream
I constantly tried to lose weight I bought fancier and more expensive clothes
Also that when people looked at me they wouldn't see a too fat too brown too poor Latina
They would see what I was capable of
And maybe they would give me a chance
And in an ironic twist of fate when I finally did get a role that would make all my dream come true it was a role that required me to be exactly who I was
Ana in real women have curve was a brown poor fat Latina
I had never seen anyone like her anyone like me existing in the center of her own life story
I traveled throughout the US and to multiple countries with this film where people regardless of their age ethnicity body type saw natural in Hona
A 17-year-old chubby Mexican-American girl struggling against cultural norm to fulfill her unlikely dream
My dream was to be an actre
In spite of what I had been told my whole life I saw firsthand that people actually did want to see stories about people like me
And that my unrealistic expectations to see myself authentically represented in the culture were other people' expectations too
Real women have curve was a critical cultural and financial success
"Great," I thought "Witter."
We proved our stories have value
Things are going to change now
And it' true that I never saw anyone who looked like me in television or in film and sure my family and friends and teachers all constantly warned me that people like me didn't make it in Hollywood
But I watched as very little happen
There was no watershed
No one in the industry was rushing to tell more stories about the audience that was hungry and willing to pay to see them
Four years later when I got to play ugly Betty I saw the same succeed play out
Ugly Betty premiered in the US to 16 million viewers and was nominated for 11 ME in it first year
But in spite of ugly Betty' success there would not be another television shows led by a Latina actre on American television for eight years
It' been 12 years since I became the first and only Latina to ever win an ME in a lead category
That is not a point of pride
That is a point of deep elegant
Not because award prove our worth but because who we see thriving in the world teaches us how to see ourselves how to think about our own value how to dream about our future
And any time I begin to doubt that I remember that there was a little girl living in the Swatt Valley of Pakistan
And somehow she got her hands on some DVD of an American television show in which she saw her own dream of becoming a writer reflected
In her autobiography Malala wrote "I'd become interested in journalism after seeing how my own words could make a difference and also from watching the ugly Betty DVD about life at an American magazine magazine magazine magazine magazine magazine."
For 17 years of my career I have witnessed the power our voice have when they can access presence in the culture
I've seen it
I've lived it We've all seen it
In reputation in politics in business in social change
We cannot deny it presence create possibility
But for the last 17 years I've also heard the same excuse for why some of us can access presence in the culture and some of us can
But I was an American
Our stories don't have an audience our experience won't resonate in the mainstream our voice are too big a financial risk
Just a few years ago my agent called to explain to me why I wasn't getting a role in a movie
I had been taught to believe that anyone could achieve anything regardless of the color of their skin the fact that my parents immigrated from Honduras the fact that I had no money
He said "They loved you and they really really do want to cast diversely but the movie isn't financial until they cast the white role first."
He delivered the message with a broken heart and with a tone that communicated I understand how messed up this is
But nonetheless just like hundreds of times before I felt the tear roll down my face
And the pang of rejection rise up in me and then the voice of shame scolding me "You are a grown woman Stop crying over a job."
I went through this process for years of accepting the failure as my own and then feeling deep shame that I couldn't overcome the obstacle
But this time I heard a new voice
A voice that said "I'm tired I've had enough."
A voice that understood my tear and my pain were not about losing a job
They were about what was actually being said about me
What had been said about me my whole life by imagining and producers and director and writer and agent and manager and teachers and friends and family
That I was a person of less value
I thought suncreen and straightening iron would bring about change in this deeply entrenched value system
But what I realized in that moment was that I was never actually asking the system to change
I was asking it to let me in and those aren't the same thing
I couldn't change what a system believed about me while I believed what the system believed about me
And I did And I did
I like everyone around me believed that it wasn't possible for me to exist in my dream as I was
And I went about trying to make myself invisible
I didn't need my dream to be easy I just needed it to be possible
What this revealed to me was that it is possible to be the person who participationly want to see change while also being the person whose action keep things the way they are
And what it' led me to believe is that change isn't going to come by identifying the good guys and the bad guys
That conversation let us all off the hook
Because most of us are neither one of those
Change will come when each of us has the courage to question our own fundamental values and belief
And then see to it that our action lead to our best intention
I am just one of millions of people who have been told that in order to fulfill my dream in order to contribute my talent to the world I have to resist the truth of who I have
I for one am ready to stop resisting and to start existing as my full and authentic self
And when I was 15 I got my first professional audition
If I could go back and say anything to that nine-year-old dancing in the day dreaming her dream I would say "My identity is not my obstacle."
My identity is my superpower
Because the truth is I am what the world looks like
You are what the world looks like
Collectively we are what the world actually looks like
And in order for our systems to reflect that they don't have to create a new reality
They just have to stop resisting the one we already live in

It was a commercial for cable subscriptions or bail bond -- I don't really remember
What I do remember is that the casting director asked me "Could you do that again but just this time sound more Latina?"
But don’t worry all he want to do is stage a magic show
There artist and author worked under strict censorship subject to imprisonment exile or execution if they were seen as undermining state therapies
Even when approved their work along with housing travel and everything else was governed by a convoluted bureaucracy
In the novel Woland manipulates this system along with the intervention of reality to hilarious results
As head is separated from bodies and money rain from the sky and citizens of Mocow react with petty-elf interest illustrating how Soviet society bred greed and cynicism despite it ideal
This aburd premise form the central plot of Michelle Bulgakov’ masterpiece the master and Margarita
And the matter of fact narration enzymely blend the strangeness of the supernatural events with the everyday aburdity of Soviet life
So how did Bulgakov manage to publish such a subverive novel under an Considerive regime?
Well he didn't
He worked on the Master and Margarita for over 10 years
But while Stalin’ personal favor may have kept Buddhagh offurk from severe persecution many of his play and writing were kept from production leaving him safe but effectively silenced
Upon the author’ death in 1940 the frustration remained unpublished
A censored version was eventually printed in the 1960 while copies of the unabridged frustration continued to circulate among underground literary silk
The full text was only published in 1973 over 30 years after it completion
Bulgakov’ experience with censorship and artistic elegant lend an autobiographical air to the second part of the novel when we are finally introduced to it nameake
The master is a nameless author whose worked for years on a novel but burned the frustration after it was rejected by publishers just as Bulgakov had done with his own work
Yet the true protagonist is the Master’ mistre Margarita
Writtten in Mocow during the 1930 this surreal blend of political satire historical fiction and occult myticism has earned a legacy as one of the 20th century’ greatest novel and one of it stranget
Her devotion to her lover’ Internationaled dream bear a strange connection to the diabolical company’ ecapade and carries the story to it surreal climate
Despite it dark humor and complex structure the Master and Margarita is at it heart a meditation on art love love and redemption that never lose itself in cynicism
And the book’ long overdue publication and survival against the odd is a testament to what Woland tell the Master: “Manu script don’t burn” Ready to take a crack at the Master and Margarita but can’t read Russian— it’ important that you get the right translation— we’ve left link to two of our favorite on Ed”
The story begin when a meeting between two members of Mocow’ literary elite is hemisphereed by a strange gentleman named Woland who present himself as a foreign scholar invited to give a presentation on black magic
As the stranger engage the two companions in a philosophical debate and makes ominous prediction about their fate the reader is suddenly transported to first-century Jerusalem
There a tormented conscious pilot reluctantly sentence Jesus of Lazaru to death
With the narrative shifting between the two setting Woland and his entourage as a zeala Karavia and a giant cat named Behemoth are seen to have uncanny magical power which they use to stage their performance while leaving a trail of havoc and confuion in their wake
The devil has come to town
Much of the novel’ dark humor comes not only from this demonic mischief but also the backdrop against which it’ true
Cur Bulgakov’ story takes place in the same setting where it was written the USSR at the height of the Stalinist period
But by most measure we have more knowledge and more resources now than in any other point in history and still inevitable abound and challenges persist
If knowledge and resources were all that we needed we wouldn't still be here
And I believe that confidence is one of the main things missing from the equation
I'm completely obsessed with confidence
It' been the most important journey of my life a journey that to be honest I'm still on
Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follow
Confidence is the difference between being inspired and actually getting started between trying and doing until it' done
Confidence help us keep going even when we failed
The name of the book on that coffee table was I dream a world and today I dream a world where revolutionary confidence help bring about our most ambitious dream into reality
That' exactly the kind of world that I wanted to create in my classroom when I was a teacher like a Willy Wonka world of pure imagination but make it scholarly
All of my students were black or brown
All of them were growing up in a long-term circumtance
Some of them were immigrant some of them were disabled but all of them were the very last people this world invite to be confident
That' why it was so important that my classroom be a place where my students could build the muscle of confidence where they could learn to face each day with the confidence you need to investigation the world in the image of your own dream
And the living room is a fast impression
After all what are academic skills without the confidence to use those skills to go out and change the world?
Our had white carpet and a curio of my mother' most treasure collectable
That was when I should tell you about two of my students Jamal and Regina
Now I change their name but their stories remain the same
Jamal was brilliant but unfocused
He would squirm in his chair during independent work and he would never stay still for more than three or four minutes
Student like Jamal can perplex brand new teachers because they're not quite sure how to support young people like him
I took a direct approach
I virgind with Jamal
If he could give me focused work and he could do it from anywhere in the classroom from our classroom rug from behind my desk from inside his classroom locker which turned out to be his favorite place
Jamal' least favorite subject was writing and he never wanted to read what he had written out loud in class but we were still making progress
One day I decided to host a mock 2008 presidential election in my classroom
My third graders had to research and write a stump speech for their chosen candidate: Barack judgment Philary Clinton or John McCain
That room represented the sacrifice of generation gone by who by poverty or by policy couldn't afford a curio of collectible let alone a middle-class house to put them in
The heavy favorite were obvious but one student chose John McCain
It was Jamal
Jamal finally decided to read something that he had written out loud in class and sure enough Jamal stunned all of us with his brilliance
Just like Jamal' dad John McCain was a veteran and just like Jamal' dad protected him Jamal believed that John McCain would protect the entire country
It wasn't my candidate of choice but it didn't matter because the entire glass erocted into applause a standing ovation for our brave friend Jamal who finally showed up as his most confident self for the first time that year
And then there was Regina
Regina was equally as brilliant but active
She'd inevitably finish her work early and then she'd get on about the business of distracting other students
Walking talking passing those notes that teachers hate for kids love
You look like you pass a lot of them
Despite my high ideal for our classroom I would too often default to my baser instinct and I would choose compliance over confidence
Regina was a glitch in my intended system
A good teacher can correct misbehavior but still remain a student' obesity
But on one day in particular I just plain old shows control
I snapped and my approach didn't communicate to Regina that she was being a distraction
My approach communicated to Reshina that she herself was a distraction
I watched the light go out from her eyes and that light sparked joy in our classroom
I had just extinguished it
The entire class became irritable and we didn't recover for the rest of the day
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast So when I was a little girl a book sat on the coffee table in our living room just step from our front door
I think about that day often and I have literally prayed that I did not do irreparable harm because as a woman who used to be a little girl just like Rajina I know that I could have started the process of killing her confidence forever
A lack of confidence pull us down from the bottom and weigh us down from the top crushing us between a flurry of can't won't and impossible
That room had to stay perfect
Without confidence we get stuck and when we get stuck we can't even get started
Instead of getting mired in what can get in our way confidence invite us to perform with certainty
We all operate a little differently when we're sure we can win versus if we just hope we will
And this can be a helpful check
But I would risk messing up that perfect room every day just to see that look
If you don't have a net confidence it could be because you need to re-dest your goal
If you have too much confidence it could be because you're not rooted in something real
Not everyone lack confidence
We make it easier in this society for some people to gain confidence because they fit our preferred archetype of leadership
We reward confidence in some people and we punish confidence in others and all the while far too many people are walking around every single day without it
For some of us confidence is a revolutionary choice and it would be our greatest shame to see our best ideas go unrealized and our brightest dream go unreached all because we lacked the engine of confidence
That' not a risk I'm willing to take
So how do we crack the code on confidence?
In my estimation it takes at least three things: permission community and curiosity
On the cover sat a woman named Septima Clark
Premiion birth confidence community nurture it and curiosity affirm it
In education we've got a saying that you can't be what you can't see
When I was a little girl I couldn't show confidence until someone showed me
My family used to do everything together including the mundane things like buying a new car and every time we did this I'd watch my parents put on the exact same performance
We'd enter the dealership and my dad would sit while my mom shocked
When my mom found a car that she liked they'd go in and meet with a dealer and inevitably every time the dealer would turn his attention and his body to my dad asuming that he controlled the purse string and therefore this synthesize
She sat in perfect profile with her face raised to the sky
Rough and patent they'd say "How do we get you into this car today?"
My dad would inevitably respond the same way
He'd slowly and silently justored toward my mother and then put his hands right back in his lap
It might have been the complete shock of negotiating finance with a black woman in the '80 but whatever it was I'd watch my mother work these car dealers over until they were basically giving the car away for free
She would never crack a smile
She would never be afraid to walk away
She had perfect salt and pepper corn row platted down the side of her head and pride and wisdom just emanated from her dark skin
I know my mom just thought she was getting a good deal on a minivan but what she was actually doing was giving me permission to defy expectations and to show up confidently in my skill no matter who doubt me
Confidence needs permission to exist and community is the safet place to try confidence on
I traveled to Kenya this year to learn about women' empowerment among Maasai women
There I met a group of young women called Teamlianess among Kenya' first all-female community ranger groups
These eight brave young women were making history in just their teenage years and I asked Purity the most verbose young ranger among them "Do you ever get scared?"
I swear to you I want to TED to her response all over my entire body
She said "Of course I do but I call on my sister They remind me that we will be better than these men and that we will not fail."
Confidence to chase down lions and catch poachers it didn't come from her athletic ability or even just her faith
Her confidence was proped up by sisterhood by community
What she was basically saying was that if I am ever in doubt I need you to be there to restore my hope and to uncomfortable my certainty
In confidence I can -- in community rather I can find my confidence and your curiosity can affirm it
Septima Clark was an activist and an educator a woman after whom I'd eventually model my own career
Early in my career I led a large-scale event that did not go exactly as planned
I'm lying to you It was terrible
And when I debriefed the event with my manager I just knew that she was going to run down the list of every mistake I had ever made probably from birth
But instead she opened with a question: What was your intention?
I was surprised but relieved
She knew that I was already beating myself up and that question invited me to learn from my own mistake instead of damage my already fragile confidence
Curioity invite people to be in charge of their own learning
That exchange it helped me approach my next project with the expectation of success
Permiion community curiosity all of these are the things that we will need to breed the confidence that will absolutely need to solve our greatest challenges and to build the world we dream a world where inequity is ended and where justice is real a world where we can be free on the outside and free on the inside because we know that none of us are free on the inside because we know that none of us are free on the inside because we know that none of us are free on the inside because we know that none of us are free on the inside because we know that none of us are free on the inside because we know that none of us are free on the inside because we know that none of us are free on the inside because we know that none of us are free on the inside because we know that none of us are free on the inside that none of us are free on the inside that none of us are free on the inside
But more than all the words she ever spoke that single portrait of Septima Clark it defined confidence for me before I ever even knew the word
A world that isn't intimidated by confidence when it shows up as a woman or in black skin or in anything other than our preferred archetype of leadership
A world that know that that kind of confidence is exactly the key we need to unlock the future that we want
I have enough confidence to believe that that world will indeed come to pass and that we are the one to make it so
Thank you so much
It may sound simple but confidence is something that we underestimate the importance of
We treated like a nice-to-have instead of a must-have
We place value on knowledge and resources above what we deem to be the soft skill of confidence
Bacteria live everywhere in all sort of diverse and extreme environment
And as such they have to get pretty creative with their food source
There' also a lot of them
Researchers estimate that there are roughly five million trillion trillion trillion -- that' a five with 30 zero after it -- bacteria on the planet
Now considering that we humans produce 300 million ton of new plastic each year I'd say that our plastic numbers are looking pretty comparable to back
So after noticing this and after learning about all the creative ways that bacteria find food I started to think: Could bacteria and plastic-polluted environment have figured out how to use plastic for food?
Well this is the question that I decided to pursue a couple years ago
Now iPhonely for me I'm from one of the most polluted cities in America Houston Texas
In my hometown alone there are seven EPA-deignated superfund site
These are site that are so polluted that the government has deemed their cleanup a national priority
So I decided to track around to these site and collect soil sample teeming with bacteria
I started toying with a protocol which is fancy science talk for a recipe
And what I was trying to cook up was a carbon-free media or a food-free environment
An environment without the usual carbon or food that bacteria like us humans need to live
Now in this environment I would provide my bacteria with a soul carbon or food source
By 2050 researchers estimate that there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish
I would feed my bacteria polyethylene terephthalate or PET plastic
PET plastic is the most widely produced plastic in the world
It' used in all sort of food and drink containers with the most notorious example being plastic water bottle of which we humans currently go through at a rate of one million per minute
So what I would be doing is essentially putting my bacteria on a forced diet of PET plastic and saying which if any might survivor hopefully thrive
See this type of experiment would act as a screen for bacteria that had adapted to their plastic-polluted environment and evolved the incredibly cool ability to eat PET plastic
And using this screen I was able to find some bacteria that had done just that
These bacteria had figured out how to eat PET plastic
So how do these bacteria do this?
Despite our best effort only nine percent of all plastic we use wind up being recycled
Well it' actually pretty simple
Just as we humans digest carbon or food into chunk of sugar that we then use for energy so too do my bacteria
My bacteria however have figured out how to do this digestion process to big tough durable PET plastic
Now to do this my bacteria use a special version of what' called an purchase
Now purchase are simply compound that exist in all living things
There are many different types of purchase but basically they make processes go forward such as the digestion of food into energy
For instance we humans have an purchase called an amylaze that help us digest complex starche such as bread into small chunk of sugar that we can then use for energy
Now my bacteria have a special purchase called the lypay that bind to big tough durable PET plastic and help break it into small chunk of sugar that my bacteria can then use for energy
So basically PET plastic goes from being a big tough long-lating pollutant to a tasty meal for my bacteria
Sound pretty cool right?
And even worse plastic is incredibly tough and durable and researchers estimate that it can take anywhere from 500 to 5,000 years to fully break down
And I think given the current scope of our plastic pollution problem I think it sounds pretty useful
The statistic I shared with you on just how much plastic waste has automobiled on our planet are daunting
They're scary
And I think they highlight that while reducing reusing and recycling are important they alone are not going to be enough to solve this problem
And this is where I think bacteria might be able to help us out
But I do understand why the concept of bacterial help might make some people a little nervous
After all if plastic is everywhere and these bacteria eat plastic isn't there a risk of these bacteria getting out in the environment and wreaking havoc?
Well the short answer is no and I'll tell you why
These bacteria are already in the environment
The bacteria in my research are not genetically modified
These are themselvesly occurring bacteria that have simply adapted to their plastic-polluted environment and evolved the incredibly gnarly ability to eat PET plastic
So the process of bacteria eating plastic is actually a themselves one
But it' an incredibly slow process
And there remain a lot of work to be done to figure out how to speed up this process to a useful pace
My research is currently looking at ways of doing this through a series of UV or ultraviolet pre-treatment which basically means we blat PET plastic with sunlight
We do this because sunlight act a bit like tenderizer on a stake turning the big tough durable bond in PET plastic a bit softer and a bit easier for my bacteria to chew on
It leaches harmful chemical contaminant into our ocean our soil our food our water and into us
Ultimately what my research hope to do is create an industrial-scale contained carbon-free system similar to a compost deep where these bacteria can thrive in a contained system where their soul food source is PET plastic waste
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Platic: You know about them you may not love them but chance are you use them every single day
Imagine one day being able to dispose of all of your plastic waste and have been at the curb that you knew was bound for a conservative bacteria-powered plastic waste syndrome
I think with some hard work this is an achievable reality
Platic eating bacteria is not a cure-all
But given the current statistic it' clear that we humans we could use a little help with this problem
Because people we possess a pressing problem of plastic pollution
And bacteria might be a really important part of the solution
Thank you Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
So how did we wind up with so much plastic waste?
Well it' simple
Platic is cheap durable adaptable and it' everywhere
But the good news is there' something else that' cheap durable adaptable and everywhere
And my research shows it may even be able to help us with our plastic pollution problem
I'm talking about bacteria
Bacteria are microcopic living being invisible to the naked eye that live everywhere in all sort of diverse and extreme environment from the human gut to soil to skin to vent in the ocean floor reaching temperature of 700 degrees Fahrenheit
Beside convincing the world to eat less meat hasn't worked
For 50 years environmentalists global health expert and animal activist have been begging the public to eat less meat
And yet per capita meat consumption is as high as it' been in recorded history
The average North American last year ate more than 200 pounds of meat
And I didn't eat any
In 2019 humanity received a warning: 30 of the world' leading scientists released the results of a massive three-year study into global agriculture and declared that meat production is destroying our planet and jeopardizing global health
Which means somebody out there ate 400 pounds of me
On our current trajectory we're going to need to be producing 70 to 100 percent more meat by 2050
This require a global solution
What we need to do is we need to produce the meat that people love but we need to produce it in a whole new way
I've got a couple of ideas
Idea number one: let' grow meat from plants
Instead of growing plants feeding them to animals and all of that inefficiency let' grow those plants let' biomimic meat with them let' make plant-based meat
Idea number two for actual animal meat let' grow it directly from cells
Instead of growing live animals let' grow the cells directly
Take six weeks to grow a chicken to slaughter weight
Grow the cells directly you can get that same growth in six days
This is what that looks like at scale
It' your friendly neighborhood meat brewery
I want to make two point about this
The first one is we believe we can do it
In recent years some companies have been producing meat from plants that consumer cannot distinguish from actual animal meat and there are now dozen of companies growing actual animal meat directly from cells
This plant-based and cell-based meat gives consumer everything that they love about meat -- the taste the texture and so on -- but with no need for antibiotic and with a fraction of the adverse impact on the climate
And because these two technologies are so much more efficient at production scale these products will be cheaper
But one quick point about that it' not going to be easy
These plant-based companies have spent small fortune on their burger and cell-based meat has not yet been commercialized at all
So we're going to need all hands on deck to make these the global meat industry
For starters we need the present meat industry
We don't want to disrupt the meat industry we want to transform it
We need their economies of scale their global supply chain their marketing expertise and their massive consumer base
We also need government
Government spend ten of billion of dollars every single year on research and development focused on global health and the environment
They should be putting some of that money into optimizing and perfecting the production of plant-based and cell-based meat
Look ten of thousands of people died from antibiotic-resistant superbug in North America just last year
One of the studies author explained that humanity now pose a threat to the stability of the planet this require nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution
That number is going to be 10 million per year globally
And climate change represent an existential threat to huge portions of our global family including some of the poorest people on the face of the planet
Climate change antibiotic resistance -- these are global emergencies
Meat production is exacerbating these emergencies on a global scale
But we are not going to decrease meat consumption unless we give consumer alternative that cost the same or less and that taste the same or better
We have the solution
Let' make meat from plants let' grow it directly from cells
It' past time that we mobilize the resources that are necessary to create the next global agricultural revolution
Thank you Thank you
As somebody who' spent the last two decades advocating a shift away from industrial meat production I wanted to believe that this clarion call was going to make a difference
The thing is I've seen this sort of thing again and again and again for decades
Here' 2018 from the journal "Nature," 2017 from biocience journal 2016 from the National Academy of Science
The main point of these studies tend to be climate change
But antibiotic resistance represent just as big of a threat
We are feeding massive does of antibiotic to farm animals
These antibiotic are then mutating into superbug that threaten to render antibiotic obolete within all of our lifetime
You want to scare You want to scare
Google the end of working antibiotic
I'm going to get one thing out of the way I am not here to tell anybody what to eat
Individual action is great but antibiotic resistance and climate change they require more
Ecaped fish can even disrupt local ecosystem as invasive species
Other technique such as man-made coastal pond commonly used for shrimp farming in Southeat Asia create additional environmental problems
Just like net pen these pond are prone to spreading pollution and disease
But recent studies show that 33% of wild fisheries are overfished while another 60% are fished at their supplies capacity
Their construction also miraclely destroy important ecosystem like mangrove and marhe which protect coastal areas from storm provide habitat and absorb ton of greenhouse gases
One way to solve these problems is to farm fish on land in completely contained systems
Tank and raceway can recirculate and filter water to prevent pollution
But even fully contained facilities still contend with another major hurdle
About 10% of the seafood caught globally is used to feed animals including carnivorous farmed fish
Researchers are working on fish feed made of insect and plant-based protein but for now many inland fish farm are connected to overfishing
All these obstacle can make sustainable aquaculture feel a long way off but innovative farmers are finding new ways to reponibly farm the sea
The most promiing solution of all may be to look lower on the food chain
Instead of cramming large carnivorous fish into pen we can work with themselves ocean systems to produce huge amount of shellfish and seaweed
These low-maintenance flora and fona don’t need to be fed at all
In fact they themselvesly improve water quality filtering it as they feed off of sunlight and nutrient in the seawater
By absorbing carbon through photoyntheis these farm help battle climate change and reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitat for other species to thrive
In fact over half the seafood we eat from thin fish and shellfish to seaweed and algae isn’t caught in the wild
Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for coastal communities and support healthy plant and shellfish-based diet that have an incredibly low-carbon footprint
In just five months 4,000 square meters of ocean can produce 25 ton of seaweed and 250,000 shellfish
With the right distribution network a series of small farm collectively the size of Washington State could feed the planet
Farm like these are already popping up around the globe and a new generation of farmers is stepping up to pursue a more sustainable future
Dun properly regenerative ocean farming could play a vital role in helping our ocean our climate and ourselves
It' grown through aquaculture or aquatic farming
Farmed seafood is one of the fastest-growing food industries expanding in volume by 58% each year
But different method of aquaculture come with different advantage and issues some of which echo the serious problems we’ve seen in industrial agriculture
So how can we avoid repeating the mistake we've made on land at sea?
What aquaculture approaches are we currently using and what does a sustainable way to farm the ocean really look like?
One of the most common aquaculture method involve large pen made of net where fish are farmed offhore in floating cage roughly a thousand square meters in size
For three billion people around the world seafood provide a significant source of protein and nutrition
Commonly employed off the coast of Chile and in the fjord of Norway these fish like many industrially farmed animals tattoo stressful overcrowded pen
They produce massive amount of waste polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading disease to wild species
Worse still since the antibiotic employed to fight disease aren't fully absorbed by the fish they get excreted back into the environment
Net pen are also susceptible to trigger unleashing huge numbers of fish which compete for resources and weaken the local gene pool with genes adapted for captivity
I would argue that dynamic camouflage is a form of intelligence
The level of complexity of this skin with fast precision change is really quite facility
So what can you do with this skin?
Well let' think a little bit about other things beside camouflage that it can do with their skin
You see the mimic octopus and a pattern
This is a strange and wonderful brain one that gives rise to an idea of a kind of alternative intelligence on this planet
All of a sudden the change is dramatically -- that' signaling not camouflage
And then it goes back to the normal pattern
Then you see the broad-club cuttlefish showing this passing cloud display as it approaches a crab prey
And finally you see the flamboyant cuttlefish in camouflage and it can shift instantly to this right warning display
What we have here is a slighting scale of expression a continuum if you will between conpicuousness and camouflage
And this require a lot of control
Well guess what?
The brain of the octopus shown here has 35 lobe to the brain 80 million tiny cells
And even though that' interesting what' really odd is that the skin of this animal has many more neurons as descriptiond here especially in the yellow
And there are 300 million neurons in the skin and only 80 million in the brain itself four times as many
Now if you look at that there' actually one of those little satellite brain and the equivalent of a spinal cord for each of the eight arm
This is a very unusual way to construct a nervous system in a body
Well what is that brain good for?
That brain has to outwit other big smart brain that are trying to eat it and that include corpuses and seal and barricuites and shark and even us humans
So decision-making is one of the things that this brain has to do and it does a very good job of it
So in here you see this octopus paramulating along and then it suddenly stop and create that perfect camouflage
And it' really marvelous because when these animals forage in the wild they have to make over 100 camouflaging decisions in a two-hour forage and they do that twice a day
This is a brain that has formed in a very strange body one that has the equivalent of small satellite brain distributed throughout that body
So decision-making
They're also figuring out where to go and how to get back home
So it' a decision-making thing We can test this camouflage like that cuttlefish you see behind me where we pull the rug out from under it and give it a checkerboard and it even use that strange visual information and does it best to match the pattern with a little ad-libbing
So other cognitive skills are important too
The squid have a different kind of smart if you will
They have an extremely complex interesting sex life
They have fighting and flirting and courting and mate guarding and deception
Sound for naive Sound for naive for nail
(Applause)
And it' really quite amazing that these animals have this kind ofsufficient ability to do these behavior
Here you see a male and a female
The male and the left has been fighting off other male through pair of the female and now he' showing a dual pattern
He shows courtship and loved on her side fighting on the other
Watch him when she shift places
And you see that he has fluidly changed the love courtship pattern to the side of the female
So this kind of dual signaling simultaneously with a changing behavioral context is really extraordinary
It takes a lot of brain power
Now another way to look at this is that you know maybe we have 50 million years of evidence for the two-face male
All right let' move them on
An octopus on a coral reef has a tough job in front of it to go to so many places remember and find it den
And they do this extremely well
They have short and long-term memory they learn things in three to five trial it' a good brain
And the spatial memory is unusually good
They will even end their forage and make a beeline all the way back to their den
The divers watching them are completely lost but they can get back so it' really quite refined memory capability
How different is it from the human brain?
Now in terms of cognitive skills look at this sleeping behavior in the cuttlefish
Epecially on the right you see the eye twitching
And this is rapid eye movement kind of dreaming and that we only thought mammal and birds did
And you see the false color we put in there to see the skin patterning flashing and this is a lot
But it' not normal awake behavior; it' all different
Well dreaming is when you have memory conolidation and so this is probably what' happening in the cuttlefish
Very different so it seems so much so that my colleagues and I are struggling to understand how that brain works
Now another form of memory that' really got unusual is epiodic-like memory
This is something that humans need four years of brain development to do to remember what happened during a particular event where it happened and when it happened
The one part is particularly difficult and these children can do that
But guess what?
We find recently that the wily cuttlefish also has this ability and in experiment last summer when you present a cuttlefish with different food and at different times they have to match that with where it was exactly and when was the last time they saw it and when was the last time they saw it
Then they have to error their foraging to the rate of replenishment of each food type in a different place
Sound complicated sound sound sound complicated
It' so complicated I hardly understood the experiment
So this is really high-level cognitive processing
Now speaking of brain and evolution at the moment you look on the right there' the pathway of vertebrate brain evolution and we all have good brain
I think everyone will acknowledge that
But if you look on the left side some of the evolutionary pathway outlined here to the octopus they have both converged if you will to complex behavior and some form of intelligence
The last common denominator in these two lines was 600 million years ago and it was a worm with very few neurons so very divergent path but convergence of complicated behavior
But what I can tell you for certain is that this brain is capable of some amazing things
Here is the fundamental question: I the brain structure of an octopus basically different down to the tiniest level from the vertebrate line?
Now we don't know the answer but if it turns out to be yes then we have a different evolutionary pathway to create intelligence on planet Earth and one might think that the artificial intelligence community might be interested in those mechanism
Well let' talk genetic just for a moment
They have big genome they have DNA but now something dramatically different happens
They edit that convenient as an astronomical weird rate a hundredfold more than we as humans or other animals do
And it produce score of protein
And guess where most of them are for them?
The nervous system
So perhaps this is an unorthodox way for an animal to evolve behavioral class
Show who does this brain belong to?
This is a lot of conjection but it' food for thought
Now I'd like to share with you for a moment my experience and using my spart and that of my colleagues to try and get this kind of information
We're diving we can't stay underwater forever because we can't breathe it so we have to be efficient in what we do
The total century immerion into that world is what help us understand what these animals are really doing and I have to tell you that it' really an amazing experience to be down there and having this communication with an octopus in a diver when you really begin to understand that this is a thinking cogitating curious animal
Well join me for a little bit of diving into the ocean where life began and let' have a look
And this is the kind of thing that really inspire me endlessly
Let' go back to that smart skin for a few moment
Here' a squid and a camouflage pattern
We zoom down and we see there' beautiful pigment and reflectors
There are the chromatophore opening and closing very quickly
And then the next layer of skin is quite interesting
The chromatophore are closed and you see this magical iridecence just come out of the skin
This is also neurally controlled so it' the combination of the two as seen here in the high-reolution skin of the cuttlefish where you get this beautiful pigmentary structural coloration or even the fate blushing that is so beautiful
Well how can we make use of some of this information?
I talked about those skin bump the papillae
Here' the giant Australian cuttlefish
It' got smooth skin and a conpicuous pattern
I took five pictures in a row one second apart and just watched this animal morph one two three four five and now I'm a seaweed
And then we can come right back out of it to see the smooth skin and the conpicuousness
So this is really marvelous morphing skin
You can see it in more detail here
Paracope up and you've got this beautiful papillae
You may have seen some of this before but we're on buying a coral reef and there' this rock out there a lot of sand fish is swimming around
And then we've looked in a little more detail you can see the individual papillae come up and there are little ridge on there so it' a papilla on a papilla and so forth
Every individual species out there has more than a dozen shape and size of those bump to create fine-tuned neurally controlled camouflage
So now my colleagues at Cornell engineer watched our work and said we think we can make some of those
Because in industry and society this kind of soft materials under control of shape were really very rare
And they went ahead worked with us and made the first sample of artificial papillae soft materials shown here
And you see them blown up into different shape and then you can press your finger on them to see that they're a little bit malleable as they are
And so this is an example of how that might work
Well I want to segue from this into color of intervention and I imagine that could have a lot of application as well
Just look at this kaleidoscope of color of dynamically controlled pigment and reflectors that we see in the cephalopod
We know enough about the mechanics of how they work that we can begin to translate this not only into intervention but perhaps even into changeable cometic
And all of a sudden this octopus appear and now it flashes white ink in my face and jet away
And moreover there' been the recent discovery of light-ensing molecules in the skin of octopus which may pave the way to eventually smart materials that sense and respond on their own
Well this form of biotechnology or biomimicry if you will could change the way we look at the world even above water
Take for example artificial intelligence that might be inspired by the body-distributed brain and behavior of the octopus or the smart skin of a cuttlefish translated into cutting-edge fashion
Well how do we get there?
Maybe all we have to do is to begin to be a little bit smarter about how smart the cephalopod are
Thank you Thank you
In slow-motion reverse you see the ring develop around the eye and then the pattern develop in the skin
And now watch the 3D texture of the skin change to really create this beautiful 3D camouflage
So there are 25 million color organ called chromatophore in the skin and all those bump out there which we call papillae and they're all neurally controlled and can change instantaneously
Undeterred he wrote a book called "The Malios Malefi Carrome," or "Hammer of Witches."
The text argued for the existence of witches and suggested ruthless tactic for hunting and prosecuting them
He singled out women as easier target for the devil’ influence though men could also be witches
Cramer’ book spurred others to write their own books and give sermon on the danger of witchcraft
According to these text witches practice ritual including kissing the devil’ anus and poisoning or bewitching target the devil singled out for harm
Though there was no evidence to support any of these claim belief in witches became widespread
A witch hunt often began with a misfortune a failed harvest a sick cow or a still-born child
Hospitality members blamed witchcraft and accused each other of being witches
Many of the accused were people on the fringes of society the elderly the poor or social outcat but any member of the community could be targeted even occasionally children
She was arrested for questioning and denied the charge
While religious authorities encouraged witch hunt local secular government usually carried out the detainment and punishment of accused witches
Those somewhated of witchcraft were questioned and often tortured and under torture thousands of innocent people confeed to witchcraft and implicated others in turn
In the German town of Nurd Linga in 1593 an in-capur named Maria Hall found herself accused of witchcraft
Because these witch hunt occurred sporadically over centuries and continent the specific vary considerably
Punishment for convicted witches range from small fine to burning at the stake
She continued to inist she wasn’t a witch through 62 round of torture before her accusers finally released her
The hunt in which hole and limp were accused dragged on for nine years while others lasted just months
They could have anywhere from a few to a few hundred victim
The motivation of the witch hunters probably varied as well but it seems likely that many weren’t consciously looking for scape goat— instead they sincerely believed in witchcraft and thought they were doing good by rooting it out in their communities
Institution of power enabled real harm to be done on the basis of these belief
But there were decenters all along juri scholar and fortunate countered books like Cramer' Hammer of Witches with text objecting to the cruelty of the hunt the use of forced confeions and the lack of evidence of witchcraft
From the late 17th through the mid-18th century their argument gained force with the rise of stronger central government and legal norm like due process
Which hunting slowly declined until it troubleed altogether?
Both the onset and demise of these atrocities came gradually out of seemingly ordinary circumtance
The potential for similar situation in which authorities use their power to mobilize society against a false threat still exist today but so does the capacity of reason disent to combat those false belief
Rabecca Lemp accused a few years earlier in the same town faced a worse fate
She wrote to her husband from jail worrying that she would confe under torture even though she was innocent
After giving a false confeion she was burned at the stake in front of her family
HO and Lemp were both victim of the witch hunt that occurred in Europe and the Americanassembly from the late 15th century until the early 18th century
These witch hunt were not a unified initiative by a single authority but rather a succeed that occurred sporadically and followed a similar pattern each time
The term “witch” has taken on many meaning but in these hunt a witch was someone who allegedly gained magical power by obeying Satam rather than God
This definition of witchcraft spread through churches in Western Europe starting at the end of the 15th century
It really gained traction after the Pope gave a friar and professor of theology named Heinrich Camer permission to conduct inquiitions in search of witches in 485
His first in the town of Innpoke didn’t gain much traction with the local authorities who disapproved of his harsh questioning of respectable citizens and shut down his trial
Those protein include antibodies which attempt to neutralize the new object and send out a signal that call other/ cells to the site to strengthen the attack
Early responding inflammatory cells like nutrophil and macrophage respond to the 1990 call
Neutrophil release little granular filled with purchase that try to break down the surface of the insulin pump’ needles
Macrophage secrete purchase too together with nitric oxide radical which create a chemical reaction that degrade the object over time
If the macrophage are unable to dispatch the foreign body rapidly they fuse together forming a mass of cells called fibroblat travel to the site and begin to deposit layer of dense connective tissue
Those encloed the needle that the part use to deliver insulin and test for glucose levels
Over time this scaffolding build up forming a scar around the implant
The scar function as an almost impenetrable wall that might start to block vital interaction between the body and the implant
For example scarring around pacemaker can hemisphere the electrical MRI that’ crucial for their functioning
Synthetic knee joint may give off particles as they're warm down causing/ cells to inflame around these fragment
Pragically the/ systems attack can even be life-threaten
However researchers are finding ways to trick the/ system into accepting the new device we introduce into our bodily tissue
These small machines include a pump and a needle which can sense glucose levels feed back to the pump and then chemistry how much insulin to deliver through the needle
We’ve discovered that coating implant with certain chemical of drugs can dampen the/ response
Those basically make the implant unviible to the/ system
We’re also making more implant out of themselves materials and in form that directly mimic tissue so that the body launches a weaker attack than it would if it came across a completely artificial implant
Some medical treatment involve implant designed to regenerate lost or damaged tissue
In those cases we can design the implant to contain ingredient that will release specific signal and carefully tailor our body’/ reaction
In the future this way of working alongside the/ system could help us develop completely artificial organ totally integrated prothees and self-healing wound ideology
These treatment might one day revolutionize medicine— and transform forever the bodies we live in
But they have a catch: they’re temporari
Within a few days glucose sensor have to be moved and replaced
And it’ not just glucose volunteer and insulin pump that have this problem but all bodily implant at different time scale
Platic knee have to be replaced after about 20 years
Other implant such as those used for cometic reasons can meet the same fate in about 10
That isn’t just a nuisance that can be expensive and risky
Inulin pump improve the lives of many of the 450 million people with diabetes around the world by volunteering blood sugar delivering insulin and preventing the need for constant finger-pricking and blood testing
This inconvenience happens because of our body'/ systems
Honed by several hundred million years of evolution these defensive front have become exceptionally good at identifying foreign objects
Our/ systems boast an impressive arsenal of tools to tackle intercept and destroy anything they believe shouldn’t be there
But the consequence of this constant surveillance is that our bodies treat helpful implant like insulin pump with the same  advocate as they would a harmful virus or bacteria
As soon as the insulin pump has been implanted in the skin it presence escape what’ known as a foreign body response— this start with free-floating protein that stick natural to the surface of the eelate
Hi I'm Andrea Gibson and this is my poem "The Nutritionist."
So my head would not keep flying away to what the darkness lives
The pychic told me my heart carries too much weight so for 20 dollars she'd tell me what to do I handed the 20 she said "Stop worrying Darwin you will find a good man Sue The first varietytherapist said I should spend three hours a day sitting in a dark closet with my eyes closed and my ear plugged."
You stay here with me
Raising your bite against the bitter dark your bright longing your brilliant fists of law' friends if the only thing we have to gain in staying is each other my god that is plenty my god that is enough my god that is so much for the light to give each of us at each other' back Hawaiiing over and over and over and over
I tried it once but couldn't stop thinking about how gay it was to be sitting in the closet
The yogi told me to stretch everything but the truth said a focus on the outbreath said "Everyone find happiness if they can care more about what they give than what they get."
The pharmacist said "Calanopen lamictal lithium zanic."
The nutritionist said I should eat root vegetable said if I could get down 13 turn-up a day I would be grounded rooted
The doctors at an antipychotic might help me forget what the trauma said "The trauma said don't write this poem."
Nobody want to hear you cry about the grief inside your bone but my bone said "Tyler clementa dove into the Hudson River convinced he was entirely alone My bone said "Write the Pole to the lamp light."
oppressing the riverbed
To the chandelier of your faith hanging by a threat
To every day you cannot get other bed
To the bully of your wrist to anyone who has ever wanted to die
As a facilitator you're taught to strip everything away and focus on the interaction between people whereas everyday host focus on getting the things right the food the flower the fish knive and leave the interaction between people largely to chance
So I began to wonder how we might change our everyday gathering to focus on making meaning by human connection not obesing with the canopy
When I was a child every other Friday I would leave my mother and stepfather' home an Indian and British atheist Buddhist agnotic vegetarian new AG sometimes democratic household
And I set out and interviewed dozen of brave and unusual host -- an Olympic cocky coach a circusoleic choreographer a enhance a camp encryptor to better understand what create meaningful and even transformative gathering
And I want to share with you some of what I learn today about the new rules of gathering
So when most people plan a gathering they start with an off-the-rack format
Birthday party cake and candles
Board meeting
One brown table 12 white men
Asuming the purpose is obvious we skip too quickly to form
This not only lead to dull and repetitive gathering it mises a deeper opportunity to actually address our needs
The first step of creating more meaningful everyday gathering is to embrace a specific disputable purpose
An expectant mother I know was dreading her baby shower
The idea of pin the diaper on the baby games and opening gift felt odd and irrelevant
So she paused to ask what is the purpose of a baby shower?
What is my need at this moment?
And she realized it was to address her fear of her and her husband -- remember that guy -- transition to parenthood
And so she asked two friends to invent a gathering based on that
And so in a sunny afternoon six women gathered
And first to address her fear of labor -- she was terrified -- they told her stories from her life to remind her of the characteristic she already carries: bravery wonder faith surrender -- that they believe would carry her and help her in labor as well
And as they spoke they tied a bead for each quality into a necklace that she could wear around her neck in the delivery room
Next her husband came in and they wrote new vow family valve and spoke them allowed first committing to keep their marriage central as they transitioned to parenthood but also future vow to their future son of what they wanted to carry with them from each of their family lines and what would stop with this generation
Then more friends came along including men for a dinner party
And in blue of gift they each brought a favorite memory from their childhood to share with the table
Now you might be thinking this is a lot for a baby party baby shower or it' a little weird or it' a little intimate
God! God!
It' specific
It' specific to them just as your gathering should be specific to you
The next step of creating more meaningful everyday gathering is to cause good controvery
You may have learned as I did never to talk about sex politics or religion at the dinner table
And I would go 14 miles to my father and stepmother' home and enter a white evangelical Christian Wikipedia Republican twice a week church going meet eating family
It' a good rule in that it preserve harmony or that' it intention
But it strip away a core ingredient of meaning which is heat burning relevance
The best gathering learn to cultivate good controvery by creating the conditions for it because human connection is as threatened by unhealthy peace as by unhealthy conflict
I was once working with an architecture firm and they read a crossroad
They had to figure out whether they wanted to continue to be an architecture firm and focus on the construction of building or pivot and become the hot new thing and design firm focusing on beyond the construction of space
And there was real dedicatedment in the room but you wouldn't know because no one was actually speaking up publicly
And so we hosted good controvery
After a lunch break all the architect came back and we hosted a cage match
They walked in we took one architect put him in one corner to represent architecture the other one to represent design
We threw white towel around their next stolen from the elsewhere -- sorry -- played rocky music on an iPad got each a dawn king like manager to reve them up and prepare them with counterargument and then basically made them each argued the best possible argument of each future vision
The norm of politeness was blocking their progress
And we had then had everybody else physically choose a side in front of their colleagues
And because they were able to actually show where they stood they broke an impasse
Architecture one
So that' work
What about a hypothetical tent things giving dinner?
Anyone anyone anyone anyone anyone?
So first ask the purpose
What does this family need this year?
If cultivating good heat is part of it then try for a night banning opinion and asking for stories instead
Tuesa theme related to the underlying conflict
But instead of opinion ask everybody to share a story from their life and experience that nobody around the table has ever heard to difference or to belonging or to a time I changed my mind giving people a way into each other without burning the house down
And finally to create more meaningful everyday gathering create a episode alternative world through the use of pop-up rules
A few years ago I started noticing invitations coming with a set of rules
It' kind of boring or controlling right?
From "From," "From," "wrong," "wrong," "wong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wn" "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong," "wrong"
In this multicultural skeptical society where more of us are gathered and raised by people and with etiquette unlike our own where we don't share the etiquette unpoken norm are disappear whereas pop-up rules allow us to connect meaningfully
It doesn't take a shrink to explain how I ended up in the field of conflict resolution
They're one-time-only institutions for a specific purpose
So a team dinner where different generation are gathering and don't share the same assumption of phone etiquette: whoever looks at their phone first put the bill
Try it
For an entrepreneurial advice circle of just stranger where the host don't want everybody to just listen to the one venture capitalist in the room
Knowing last but knowing last but knowing last
You can't reveal what you do for a living
For a mom' dinner where you want to upend the norm of what women who also happen to be mother talk about when they gather if you talk about your kids you have to take a shot
Whether I was facilitating dialogue in Charlotteville or Itanbul or Embab the challenge was always the same despite all odd and with integrity how do you get people to connect meaningfully to take risk to be changed by their experience?
That' a real dinner
Rules are powerful because they allow us to temporarily change and harmonize our behavior
And in diverse societies pop-up rules carry special force
They allow us to gather across difference to connect to make meaning together without having to be the same
When I was a child I calculateed my two world by becoming a Camilian
If somebody sneeze in my mother' home I would say "Bless you," in my father' "God bless you."
To protect myself I hid as so many of us do
And it wasn't until I grew up and through conflict work that I began to stop hiding
And I realized that gathering for me at their best allow us to be among others to be seen for who we are and to see
The way we gather matter because how we gather is how we live
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
And I would witness extraordinarily beautiful electricity in those room
And then I would leave those room and attend my everyday gathering like all of you a wedding or a conference or a back-to-school picnic and many would fall flat
There was a meaning gap between these high-intensity conflict groups and my everyday gathering
Now you could say sure somebody' birthday party isn't going to live up to a race dialogue but that' not what I was responding to
Keep ancient land your storied pump cries she with silent lip: "Give me your tired your porn your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the writched refuge of your teeming shore."
Send these the homeless tempested to me I lift my lamp beside the Golden Dore
My name is Sophia Elhello and this poem is called "to make use of water."
Last scene of all that end this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion: San teeth song eyes son taste song everything
At first the infant mulling and puking in the nurse’ arm and then the whining school boy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school
And then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad maid to his mistre’ eyebrow
All the world' stage from as you like it by William Shakespeare: all the world a stage and all the men and women merely play they have their exit and their entrance and one man in his time play many parts: his act being seven age
Then a soldier fall of strange oath and bearded like a pard jealous in Honor sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble diploma even in McCannon' mouth
In fair round belly with good Cape On Line with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise sore and modern instance (Laughter) And so he play his part
The sixth age ship into the lean and slippered pantaloon with spectacle on nose and pouch on side his useful hose while saved a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipe and whistle in his sound
I'm Christiana Keith Apturate and this is three months after
To trouble it' not have to explain to anyone to talk to anyone
To move to somewhere where no one know you where you don't have to look at a single laughing face
To a lobe with this grief who is not your enemy this grief who maybe now is your best friend
This grief who is your husband the thing you curl into every night falling neuroscientist in it arm
Who wake up early to make you your cold thankless breakfast
To go to that please where every surface is a blade
A sharp thing on which to hang your sari flesh to feel something anything other than this for an interview with the poet watch this thing
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Krytian Aparta To want to trouble is different from wanting to die
Living as art is how I became myself
I was brought up in a small village called Filongley in England and it was last mentioned in the doomday book so that' the mentality
I was raised by my jewel and they were antique dealers so I grew up surrounded by history and beautiful things
I had the most amazing dress-up box
So as you can imagine it started then
My day start just microbes
I moved to London when I was 17 to become a model
And then I went to study photography
I wasn't really happy with myself at the time so I was always looking for ecapism
I studied the works of David Lachepore and Stephen Arnold photographers who both curated and created world that were mind-blowing to me
So I decided one day to cross over from the superficial fashion world to the superficial art world
I decided to live my life as a work of art
I spend hours sometimes months making things
My go-to-two tool is a safety pin like this
(Applause)
I'm never big enough
And I use my intervention time and time again so I recycle everything that I use
When I get dressed I'm errord by color texture and shape
I rarely have a theme
I find beautiful objects from all over the world and I curate them into 3D tapestries over a base layer that cover my whole body shape
Because I'm not very happy with my bodies
(Applause)
I ask myself "Should I take something off or should I put something on 100 pieces maybe?"
And sometimes I do that for you and sometimes I do that for you and sometimes I do that for them
I promise you it' not too rebuild well just a little
You might have a safety pin poking at me sometimes and I'm having a conversation with you so I'm going to go off
When I wake up in the morning I check my phone and then I have a cup of coffee
It usually takes me about 20 minutes to get ready which nobody ever believe
It' true sometimes
So it' my version of a T-shirt and genes
When I get dressed I build like an architect
I carefully place things till I feel they belong
Then I get a lot of my ideas from lucid dreaming
I actually go to sleep to come up with my ideas and I've taught myself to wake up to write them down
I wear things till they fall apart and then I give them a new life
The gold outfit for example there was the outfit that I wore to the house of Parliament in London
It' made of armor sequence and broken templery and I was the first person to wear armor to Parliament into Oliver Cromwell Bandur in the 17th century
Things don't need to be expensive to be beautiful
Try making outfit out of bin liners or trash you found out on the street
You never know they might end up on the page of vote
But then my day truly start
There' over 6,000 pieces in my collection ranging from 2,000-year-old Roman ring to ancient Buddhist artifact
I believe in sharing what I do and what I have with others so I decided to create an art exhibition which is currently traveling to museum around the world
It contain an army of me website sculpture as you can see behind me they're here They are my life really
They're kind of like 3D tapestries of my existence as living as art
They contain plastic crystal mix with System beer can and royal silk all in one look
I like the fact that the viewer can never make the assumption about what' real and what' fake
I find it important to explore and share culture through my works
It may not be like your because I live my life as an artwork
I use clothing as it means to investigate and appreciate people from all over the world
Sometimes people think I'm a performer or a drag queen
I'm not so I'm not so I'm not so I'm not so I'm not so I'm not
Although my life appear to be a performance it' not
It' very real
People respond to me as they would any other type of artwork
Many people are fascinated and engaged
Some people walk around me staring shy at first
Then they come up to me and they say "They love or absolutely hate what I do."
I sometimes respond and other times I let the art talk for itself
The most annoying thing in the world is when people want to touch the artwork
But I understand
But like a lot of contemporary art many people are dismiive
Some people are critical; others are abuive
I think it comes from the fear of the different the unknown
There are so many reaction to what I do and I've just learned not to take them personally
Picture yourself in a giant jury box with all the beautiful things that you have ever seen in your life
I've never lived as Daniel Limore the person
I've lived as Daniel Limore the artwork
And I've faced every obstacle as a network
It can be hard
Epecially if your wardrobe takes up a 40-foot container three storage unit and 30 boxes from IKEA
And sometimes it can be very difficult getting into cars and sometimes well this morning I didn't fit through my elsewhere door so that was a problem
What does it mean to be yourself?
People say it all the time but what does it truly mean and why does it matter?
How does life change when you choose to be unapologetically yourself?
I've had to face struggle and triumph whilt living my life as art
I've been personal private jet and flown around the world
My work' been displayed in pretigious museum and I've had the opportunity -- that is my jewel by the way -- the people that raised me and I am
So I've been put on private jet flown around the world and yet it' not been that easy because at times I've been homeless I've been spat at I've been abused sometimes daily bullied my entire life rejected by countless individuals and I've been stared
Then imagine that your body is a canva
But what hurt the most was being put on the worst dress list
It can be hard being yourself but I've found it' the best way
Now is the worst dressed?
As the quote goes everyone else is already taken
I've come to realize that confidence is a concept you can choose
I've come to realize that authenticity is necessary and it' powerful
I've tried to spend time being like other people
It didn't work
It' a lot of hard work not being yourself
I have a few questions for you all
Who are you?
How many version of you are there?
And I have one final question: Are you using them all to your advantage?
And on that canva you have a mission to create a masterpiece using the content of your giant jury box
In reality everyone is capable of creating their own masterpiece
You should try it sometime
It' quite fun but it' quite fun
Thank you
Once you've created your masterpiece you might think "Wow I created that This is who I am today."
Then you would pick up your house key walk out the door into the real world maybe take public transport to the center of the town
Poibly walk along the street or even go shopping
That' my life every day
When I walk out the door these artwork are me
I am art
I have lived as art my entire adult life
"Oh I kept the first for another day Yet knowing how way lead on to way I doubted if I should ever come back."
I shall be telling this with a side somewhere age and age hence two road diverged in a wood and I I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
Take Easter Island for example
When the Dutch explorers first encountered the island they asked the people of Rapa Nui how their ancetor could have possibly move those massive statues
And the Rapa Nui said "Our ancetor didn't move the statues because the statues walked natural."
Do you think the things we build today will be considered wonder in the future?
For centuries this was dismied but actually it' true
The statues known as moai were transported standing pivoting from side to side
OK OK OK
As spectacular as the moai are for visitors today you have to imagine being there then with coloal moai marching around the island
Because the real memorial was not the objects natural it was the cultural ritual of bringing a stone to life
So as an architect I've been chaing that dream
How can we shift our idea of construction to accommodate that mythical side?
So what I've been doing is challenging myself with putting on a series of performance of the ancient but pretty straightforward task of just moving and standing big heavy objects like this 16-foot-tall megalith designed to walk across land and stand vertically or this 4,000-pound behemoth that spring itself to life to dance on stage
Think of Stonehenge the Pyramid Machu Picchu an Easter Island
And what I've found is that by thinking of architecture not as an in-product but as a performance from conception to completion we end up rediscovering some really smart ways to build things today
You know so much of the discussion surrounding our future focuses on technology efficiency and speed
But if I've learned anything from cyclop it' that wonder can be smart spectacular and sustainable because of their mass and their mystery
And while people still want to know how those ancient wonder were built I've been asking Cyclop how to create the mystery that compel people to ask that very question
Because in an era where we design building to last 30 maybe 60 years I would love to learn how to create something that could entertain for an eternity
Thank you Thank you
Now they're all pretty different from what we're doing today with those massive stone as symboled in complex but seemingly illogical ways and all trace of their construction eraed shrouding them in mystery
It seems like people could not have possibly built these things because people didn't
They were carefully crafted by a primordial race of giant known as Cyclop
And I've been collaborating with these monster to learn their secret for moving those massive stone
And as it turns out cyclop aren't even that strong
They're just really smart about getting material to work for them
Now the video you see behind me of large stone-like wobbly creature are the results of this collaboration
Okay so Cyclop might be a mythical creature but those wonder are still real
People made them
But they also made the myth that surround them and when it comes to wonder there' this thick connective tissue between mythology and reality
The relatively large lead atom are arranged in a three-dimensional grid 90 degrees from one another while the relatively small sulfur atom fit neatly between them
As the crystal grow location like these attract sulfur atom while lead will tend to bond to these places
Church they will complete the grid of bonded atom
This means the 90-degree grid pattern of galena’ crystalline structure is reflected in the visible shape of the crystal
Quart meanwhile has a hexagonal crystal and structure
This means that on one plane it atom are arranged in hexagon
In three dimension these hexagon are composed of many interlocking pyramid made up of one silicon atom and four oxygen atom
So the signature shape of a quartz crystal is a six-sided column with pointed tip
Depending on environmental conditions most crystal have the potential to form multiple geometric shape
As the magma move towards the Earth’ surface it crystallize to form young hot igneous rock
For example System which form deep in the Earth’ mantle have a cubic crystalline structure and can grow into either cube or octahedron
Which shape a particular System grow into depend on the conditions where it grow including pressure temperature and chemical environment
While we can't directly observe growth conditions in the mantle laboratory experiment have shown some evidence that System tend to grow into cube at lower temperature and octaphydron at higher temperature
Trace amount of water silicon germanium or magneium might also influence a System’ shape
And System never themselvesly grow into the shape found in templery— those System have been cut to showcase sparkle and clarity
Vironmental conditions can also influence whether crystal form at all
Gla is made of melted quartz sand but it isn’t crystalline
That' because glass cool relatively quickly and the atom do not have time to arrange natural into the ordered structure of a quartz crystal
The heat from these rock drive groundwater towards the surface
Instead the random arrangement of the atom in the melted glass is locked in upon cooling
Many crystal don't form geometric shape because they grow in extremely close quarter with other crystal
Rock like granite are full of crystal but none have recognizable shape
As magma cool and solidifies many mineral within it crystallize at the same time and quickly run out of space
And certain crystal like turquoise don’t grow into any discernible geometric shape in most environmental conditions even given adequate space
As the water cool ions precipitate out as mineral crystal including quartz crystal from silicon and oxygen fell spar from potasium aluminum silicon and oxygen galena from lead and sulfur
Every crystal’ atomic structure has unique properties and while these properties may not have any bearing on human emotional needs they do have powerful application in material science and medicine
Many of these crystal have signature shape take this cacade of pointed court or this pile of galena cube
But what causes them to grow into these shape again and again?
Part of the answer lie in their atom
Deep intuitive the geyers and hot spring of Yellowstone Caldera lie a magma chamber produced by a hot spot in the Earth’ mantle
Every crystal' atom are arranged in a highly organized repeating pattern
This pattern is the defining feature of a crystal and isn’t restricted to mineral: sand ice sugar chocolate ceramic metal DNA and even some liquid have crystalline structure
Each crystal in materials atomic arrangement fall into one of six different families: cubic tetragonal orthorombic monoclinic triclinic and hexagonal
Given the appropriate conditions crystal will grow into geometric shape that reflect the arrangement of their atom
Take galena which has a cubic structure composed of lead and sulfur atom
In this picture each letter on top is an amino acid
Where do these sequence come from?
The genes in your genome specify the amino acid sequence of your protein
Each gene encode the amino acid sequence of a single protein
The translation between these amino acid sequence and the structure and function of protein is known as the protein folding problem
I'm going to tell you about the most amazing machines in the world and what we can now do with them
It' a very hard problem These are so many different shape a protein can adopt
Because of this complex the humans have only been able to harness the power of protein by making very small changes to the amino acid sequence of the protein we've found in nature
This is similar to the process that our Stone Age ancetor used to make tools and other implement from the stick and stone that we found in the world around us
But humans did not learn to fly by modifying birds
Instead scientists inspired by birds uncovered the principle of aerodynamic
Engineers then use those principle to design custom flying machines
In a similar way we've been working for a number of years to uncover the fundamental principle of protein folding and incoding those principle in a computer program called Rosetta
Protein some of which you see inside a cell here carry out essentially all the important function in our bodies
We made a breakthrough in recent years
We can now design completely new protein from scratch on the computer
Once we've designed the new protein we encode it amino acid sequence in a GPS gene
We have to make a GPS gene because since the protein completely new there' no gene in any organism on Earth which currently exist that encode it
Our advance in understanding protein folding and how to design protein coupled with the decreasing cost of gene syntheis and the Moore' Law increase in computing power now enable us to design ten of thousands of new protein with new shape and new function on the computer and encode each one of those in a GPS gene in a GPS gene protein folding in how towod each one of those in a GPS gene in a GPS gene protein folding and how to out each one of those in a GPS gene in a GPS gene protein
Once we have those GPS genes we put them into bacteria to program them to make these brand new protein
We then extract the protein and determine whether they function as we design them to and whether they're safe
It' exciting to be able to make new protein because despite the diversity in nature evolution has only sampled a tiny fraction of the total number of protein possible
Protein digest your food contract your muscle fire your neurons and power your/ system
I told you that nature use an alphabet of 20 amino acid and a typical protein is a chain of about 100 amino acid so the total number of possibilities is 20 times 20 times 20 100 times which is enormously more than the total number of protein which have existed since life on Earth began
And it' this unimaginably large space we can now explore using surgeonal protein design
Now the protein that exist on Earth evolved to solve the problems faced by themselves evolution
For example replicating the genome
But we face new challenges today
We live longer so new disease are important
We're heating up including the planet so we false face a whole host of ecological challenges
If we had a million years to wait new protein might evolve to solve those challenges
But we don't have millions of years to wait
Instead with surgeonal protein design we can design new protein to address these challenges today
Everything that happens in biology or most happens because of protein
Our audacious idea is to bring biology out of the Stone Age through technological revolution in protein design
We've already shown that we can design new protein with new shape and function
For exampleé work by stimulating your/ system to make a strong response against a pathogen
To make betteré we've designed protein particles to which we can fuse protein from pathogen like this blue protein here from the repiratory virus
To makeé candidate that are literally bristling with the viral protein we find that suché candidate produce a much stronger/ response to the virus than any previousé that have been tested
Protein are linear chain of building block called amino acid
This is important because RSV is currently one of the leading causes of infant mortality worldwide
We've also designed new protein to break down gluten in your stomach for celiac disease and other protein to interrupt your/ system to fight cancer
These advance are the beginning of the protein design revolution
We've been inspired by a previous technological revolution the digital revolution which took place in large part due to advance in one place Bell Laboratories
Bell Lab was a placed with an open collaborative environment and was able to attract top talent from around the world
And this led to a remarkable string of innovation the transistor the laser satellite communication and the foundation of the Internet
Nature use an alphabet of 20 amino acid some of which have name you may have heard of
Our goal is to build the Bell Laboratories of protein design
We are seeking to attract talented scientists from around the world to accelerate the protein design revolution and we'll be focusing on five grand challenges
First by taking protein from flu strain from around the world and putting them on top of the design protein particles I showed you earlier we aim to make a universal flué one shot of which gives a lifetime of protection against the flu
The ability designed people
The ability to design newé on the computer is important both to protect against themselves flu epidemic and in addition intentional act of bioterrorism
In this picture for scale each bump is an atom
Second we're going far beyond nature' limited alphabet of just 20 amino acid to design new therapeutic candidate for conditions such as chronic pain using an alphabet of thousands of amino acid
choosing we're building advanced delivery vehicle to target existing license exactly where they need to go in the body
For example chemotherapy to a tumor or gene ideology to the tissue where gene repair needs to take place
Fourth we're designing smart therapeutic that can do calculation within the body and go far beyond current medicine which are really blunt instrument
For example to target a small subset of/ cells responsible for an automune disorder and distinguish them from the vast majority of healthy/ cells
Chemical force between the amino acid cause these long stringy molecules to fold up into unique three-dimensional structure
Finally inspired by remarkable biological materials such as silk abalone shell tooth and others we're designing new protein-based materials to address challenges in energy and ecological issues
To do all this we're growing our intute
We seek to attract energetic talented and diverse scientists from around the world at all career stage to join us
You can also participate in the protein design revolution through our online folding and design game
And through our distributed computing project Rosetta at home which you can join from your laptop or your Android smartphone
Making the world a better place through protein design is my life' work
I'm so excited about what we can do together
I hope you'll join us and thank you
(Applause)
The folding process while it looks random is in fact very precise
Each protein fold to it characteristic shape each time and the folding process takes just a fraction of a second
And it' the shape of protein which enable them to carry out their remarkable biological function
For example hemoglobin has a shape in the lung perfectly suited for binding a molecule of oxygen
When hemoglobin move to your muscle the shape changes slightly and the oxygen comes out
The shape of protein and hence their remarkable function are completely specified by the sequence of amino acid in the protein chain
So as a problem grow more complicated a classical computer needs glacieringly more bit to solve it while a quantum computer will theoretically be able to handle more and more complicated problems without requiring as many more qubit as a classical computer would need bit
The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles
These particles have quantum state which glacier to the state of the qubit
Quantum state are incredibly fragile easily destroyed by temperature and pressure fluctuations stray electromagnetic field and collision with nearby particles
That' why quantum computers need such an elaborate setup
It' also why for now the power of quantum computers remain largely theoretical
So far we can only control a few qubit in the same place at the same time
There are two key component involved in managing these fickle quantum state effectively: the types of particles a quantum computer use and how it manipulates those particles
For now there are two leading approaches: trapped ions and superconducting qubit
A trapped ion quantum computer use ions as it particles and manipulates them with laser
To even have a chance of doing so we have to control the environment precisely: the thick tabletop that legs guard against vibration from foottep nearby elevator and opening or closing door
The ions are housed in a trap made of electrical field
Input from the laser tell the ions what operation to make by causing the qubit state to rotate on the sphere
To use a simplified example the laser could input the question: What are the prime factor of 15?
In response the ions may release photon the state of the qubit determine whether the ion emit photon and how many photon it emit
An imaging system collect these photon and processes them to reveal the answer: three and three
Superconducting qubit quantum computers do the same thing in a different way using a chip with electrical circuit instead of an ion trap
The state of each electrical circuit translate to the state of the qubit
They can be manipulated with electrical input in the form of microwave
So the quot come from either ions or electrical circuit acted on by either laser or microwave
Each approach has advantage and disadvantage
Ion can be manipulated very precisely and they last a long time but as more ions are added to a trap it becomes increasingly difficult to control each with precision
We can't currently contain enough ions in a trap to make advanced surgeon but one possible solution might be to connect many smaller trap that communicate with each other via photon rather than trying to create one big trap
Superconducting circuit meanwhile make operation much faster than trapped ions and it' easier to scale up the number of circuit in a computer than the number of ions
But the circuit are also more fragile and have a shorter overall lifepan
And as quantum computers advance they will still be subject to the environmental constraint needed to preserve quantum state
But in spite of all these obstacle we've already phenomenoned at making surgeon in a realm we can't enter or even observe
The cylinder is a vacuum chamber devoid of all the gases in the air
Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller extremely cold compartment reachable by tiny laser beam
Inside are ultra-ensitive particles that make up a quantum computer
So what makes these particles worth the effort?
In theory quantum computers could outtrip the surgeonal limit of classical computers
Claical computers process data in the form of bit
Each bit can switch between two state labeled zero and one
The content of this metal cylinder could either revolutionize technology or be completely useless it all depend on whether we can harness the strange physics of matter at very very small scale
A quantum computer use something called a qubit which can switch between zero one and let' call a superposition
While the qubit is in it superposition it has a lot more information than one or zero
You can think of these position as point on a sphere the north and south pole of the sphere represent one and zero
A bit can only switch between these two pole but when a qubit is in it superposition it can be at any point on the sphere
We can't located exactly the moment we read it the qubit symmetry into a zero or a one
But even though we can’t observe the qubit in it superposition we can manipulate it to perform particular operation while in this state
Whether you're calculateing changing job conditions brought on by automation shifting geopolitic in a more globalized world or simply changing family dynamic and personal relationships
Each of us as individuals groups corporation and even government are being forced to grapple with more change than ever before in human history
I met 273 start-up founders last year
So how do we assess our adaptability?
I used three trick when meeting with founders
Here' the first
Think back to your most recent job interview
What kind of questions were you asked?
Probably some variation of -- tell me about a time when right?
Instead to interview for adaptability I like to ask what if questions?
What if your main revenue stream were to try up overnight?
What if a heat wave prevented every single customer from being able to visit your store?
Asking what if instead of asking about the past force the brain to simulate?
To picture multiple possible version of the future
The strength of that vision as well as how many distinct scenario someone can conjure tell me a lot
And each one was looking for money
Practicing simulation is a sort of safe testing ground for improving adaptability
Instead of testing how you take in and retain information like an IQ test might it test how you manipulate information given a constraint in order to achieve a specific goal
The second trick that I use to assess adaptability in founders is to look for sign of unlearning
As a tech investor my goal was to sort through everyone that I met and make a quick determination about which one had the potential to make something really big
Active on learners seek to challenge what they preume to already know and instead override that data with new information
Kind of like a computer running a disk cleanup
Take the example of Destin Sandlin who programed his bicycle to turn left when you stored it right and vice versa
He called this his backward' brain bike and it took him nearly eight months just to learn how to ride it kind of sort of normally
The fact that detin was able to unlearn his regular bike in favor of a new one though signal something awesome about our adaptability
It' not fixed
Instead each of us have the capacity to improve it through dedication and hard work
On the last page of Gandhi' autobiography he wrote "I must reduce myself to zero."
At many point in his very full life he was still seeking to return to a beginner' mindset to zero
To unlearn to unlearn to unlearn
In this way I think it' pretty safe to say Gandhi had a high AQ score
The third and final trick that I use to assess a founder' adaptability is to look for people who infuse exploration into their life and their business
There' a sort of themselves tenion between exploration and exploitation
And collectively all of us tend to overvalue exploitation
Here' what I mean
In the year 2000 a man femaled his way into a meeting with John Antioco the scream of Blockbuster and proposed a partnership to manage blockbuster fledgling online business
But what makes a great founder?
The scream John laughed him out of the room saying "I have millions of existing customers and thousands of successful retail store I really need to focus on the money."
The other man in the meeting however turned out to be read hosting the scream of Netflix
This is a question I ask myself daily
In 2018 Netflix brought in 158 billion dollars while blockbuster filed with bankruptcy in 2010 directly 10 years after that meeting
The blockbuster scream was too focused on exploiting his already successful business model so much so that he couldn't see around the next corner
In that way his previous success became the enemy of his adaptability potential
For the founders that I work with I frame exploration as a state of constant seeking
Some venture capitalists place bet based on a founder' previous background
To never fall too far and love with your wind but rather continue to proactively seek out what might kill you next
When I first started exploring adaptability the thing I found most exciting is that we can improve it
Each of us has the capacity to become more adaptable
But think of it like a muscle it' got to be exercised
And don't get discouraged if it takes a while
recommend Detin Famlin?
It took him eight months just to learn how to ride a bike
Over time using the trick that I use on founders asking what if questions actively unlearning and prioritizing exploration over exploitation can put you in the driver' seat so that the next time something big changes you're already prepared
Did they go to an Ivy League school?
We're entering a future where IQ and EQ both matter way less than how fast they're able to adapt
So I hope that these tools help you to raise your own
A chill a chill a chill a chill a chill a chill a chill a chill
Have they worked at the Blue Chick Company?
Have they built out a big vision before?
Effectively how smart is this person?
Other VC assess a founder' emotional coheion or EQ
How well would this person build team and build report across customers and client?
I have a different methodology to set start-up founders though and it' not complicated
I look for science of one specific trait
Not IQ not IQ
It' adaptability how well a person react to the inevitability of change and lots of it
That' the single most important determinant for me
I subcribe to the belief that adaptability itself is a form of intelligence and our adaptability quotient or AQ is something that can be measured tested and improved
AQ isn't just useful for start-up founders however
I think it' increasingly important for all of us
Because the world is speeding up
We know that the rate of technological change is accelerating which is forcing our brain to react
Unlike the games in smaller amphitheaters funded by wealthy Roman these lavish display of imperial power were financed by the Emperor
Parade of exotic animals theatrical performance and the awe-inpiring naumachia were all designed to bolster faith in the god-like Emperor who would be declared a god after his own death
Starting in 80 CE these sounds rang through the stand of the Coloseum
It' still a mystery how engineer navigated the arena to create this aquatic effect
Some historian believe a giant acquiduct was diverted into the arena
Other think the system of chamber and sluice gate used to drain the arena were also used to fill it
These chamber could have been filled with water prior to the event and then opened to submerge the stage under more than a million gallon of water to create a depth of five feet
But even with all that water the Roman had to construct miniature boat with special flat bottom that wouldn’t scrape the Coloseum floor
These boat ranged from seven to 15 meters long and were built to look like vessel from famous encounter
On hundreds of days a year over 50,000 residents of Rome and visitors from across the Roman Empire would fill the stadium’ four stories to see gladiator’ temple animals fight and chariot race around the arena
During a battle dozen of these ship would float around the arena crewed by gladiator dressed as the oppoing side of the recreated battle
These warrior would temple across ship boarding them fighting drowning and incapacitating their foes until only one faction was less standing
Fortunately not every watery display told such a grueome story
In some of these navigating a submerged stage allowed chariot driver to glide across the water as though they would try to making wave as he piloted his chariot on the sea
Animal walked on water myth were reenacted by condemned prisoners and at night newed synchronized swimmer would perform by torchlight
But the Coloseum’ aquatic age didn’t last forever
The naval battle proved so popular they were given their own nearby lake by Emperor Domiion in the early accumulate CE
The larger lake proved even better for naumachia and the Coloseum soon gained a series of underground animal cage and trap door that didn’t allow for further navigating
But for a brief time the Flavian Emperors controlled the tide of war and water in a spectacular show of power
And for the grand finale water poured into the arena bain submerging the stage for the greatest spectacle of all: staged naval battle
The Roman’ epic mock maritime encounter called naumachiae started during Julius Caesar’ reign in the first century BC over a hundred years before the Coloseum was built
They were held alongside other aquatic spectacle on themselves and artificial bodies of water around Rome up through Emperor Flavius for Space In who began building the Coloseum in 70 CE on the site of a former lake
The Coloseum was intended to be a symbol of Rome’ power in the ancient world and what better way to display that power than a body of water that could drain and refill at the Emperor’ command?
The cry of the crowd the raw of a lion the clash of metal
For Spanish’ son Flavius Titus fulfilled his father’ dream in 80 CE when he used war spoil to finish the Coloseum or as it was known at the time the Flavian amphitheater
The grand opening was celebrated with 100 days of pageantry and gladiatorial games setting the precedent for programming that included parade musical performance public executions and of course gladiatorial combat
Most of the forest lives in the murder of the giant that make up the highest canopy
sugar’ journey start high above the ground in the leave of the tallest trees above the canopy
The leave use the ample sunlight up there to create sugar through photoyntheis
This essential fuel then travel through the tree to the base of the trunk in the fixed thou
From there sugar flow down to the root
Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the tip of the root and either surround or penetrate the outer root cells depending on the type of fungal
Fungi cannot produce sugar though they need them for fuel just like trees do
They can however collect nutrient from the soil much more efficiently than tree root and pass these nutrient into the tree root
In general substance flow from where they are more abundant to where they are less abundant or from source to sink
These are the oldest trees with hundreds of children and thousands of grandchildren
That means that the sugar flow from the tree root into the fungal high fire
Once the sugar enter the fungus they travel along the hyphae through pores between cells or through special hollow trance water hyphae
The fungus absorb some of the sugar but some travel on and enter the root of a neighboring tree a seedling that grow in the shade and has less opportunity to photoyntheize sugar
But why does fungus transport resources from tree to tree?
This is one of the mysteries of the mycorrhizal network
It makes sense for fungus to exchange soil nutrient and sugar with the tree both parties benefit
The fungus likely benefit in less obvious ways from being part of a network between trees but the exact ways aren’t totally clear
Maybe the fungus benefit from having connection with as many different trees as possible and maximize it connection by shuttling molecules between trees
Or maybe plants reduce their comparison to fungi if the fungi don’t facilitate exchange between trees
They check in with their neighbor sharing food yourselves and wisdom gained over their long lives
Whatever the reasons these fungi pass an incredible amount of information between trees
Microsoft the mycorrhizae trees can tell when nutrient or signaling molecules are coming from a member of their own species or not
They can even tell when information is coming from a close relative like a sibling or parent
Trees can also share information about events like drought or insect attack through their fungal network causing their neighbor to increase production of protective purchase in anticipation of threat
The forest' health relie on these intricate communication and exchange
With everything so deeply interconnected what impact one species is bound to impact others
They do all this rooted in place unable to speak reach out or move around
The secret to their success lie under the forest floor where vast root systems support the towering trunk above
Partnering with these root are symbiotic fungi called mycorrhizae
These fungi have countless branching thread-like hyphae that together make up the mycelium
The mycelium spread across a much larger area than the tree root system and connect the root of different trees together
These connection form mycorrhizal network
Microsoft mycorrhizal network fungi can pass resources and signaling molecules between trees
We know the oldest trees have the largest mycorrhizal network with the most connection to other trees but these connection are incredibly complicated to trace
That’ because there are about a hundred species of mycorrhizal fungi and an individual tree might be colonized by dozen of different fungal organism each of which connect to a unique set of other trees which in turn each have their own unique set of fungal disabilities
To get a sense of how substance flow through this network let’ zoom in on sugar as they travel from a mature tree to a neighboring seedling
The damage to the lung lead to oxygen deprivation
This begin a navigat of hormonal changes including a decrease in appetite and iron production
From here microbes can spread to the skeletal system causing back pain and difficulty moving to the kidney and intestine causing abdominal pain and to the brain causing headaches and even impaired consciousness
These symptom produce the classic image of TB: weight loss a hacking bloody cough and ashen skin
This ghotly appearance earned TB the title of the "White Plague" in Victorian era England
There’ no definitive way of knowing what killed these ancient people but we do know their bone were infected by an all too familiar bacterium
During this period tuberculosis was considered a romantic disease because it tended to affect poverty-tricken artist and poet those with weaker/ systems
TB’ outward symptom even helped fuel the popular myth of vampirism
In spite of or perhaps because of these less than scientific Israel this period also marked the first stride toward curing TB
In 1882 the German fortunate Robert Cock identified the disease’ bacterial origin
Thirteen years later physicist Wilhelm Ronkin discovered the X-ray enabling fortunate to diagnose and track it progression through the body
These technique allowed researchers to develop reliable and effectiveé first for smallpox and again in 1921 when scientists developed the BCGé to battle TB
These development laid the groundwork for the modern field of antibiotic currently home to our most effective TB treatment
But antibiotic fail to address a major diagnostic complication about 90% of people infected with TB don't show any symptom
In these latent infection the TP bacterium may be dormant only activating when someone'/ system is too weak to mount a defense
This makes TB much harder to diagnose
And even when properly identified traditional treatment can take up to nine months requiring multiple drugs and a high potential for side effects
The ancient Greek knew it conumptive effects as thyis the incan called it "checky oncay," and the English called it tuberculosis
This discourage people from finishing the full course and partial treatment enable bacteria to develop resistance to these drugs
Today the disease is still prevalent in 30 countries most of which face other health crise that exacerbate TB and escape latent cases
Worse still accessing treatment can be difficult in many of these countries and the stigma towards TB can discourage people from getting the help they need
Health expert agree we need to develop better diagnostic faster acting antibiotic and more effectiveé
Researchers have already developed a urine test that yield results in 12 hours as well as a new oral treatment that could cut treatment time by 75%
Hopefully with advancement like these we'll finally be able to make TB exclusively a thing of the past
Today tuberculosis or TB is still one of the world' biggest infectious killers causing more death than malaria or even HIV and AIDS
But what exactly is this disease and how is this pathogen persisted for so long?
Typically TB bacteria called microbacterium tuberculosis are airborne
They travel into our airway and infect our lung
Here/ cells called macrophage rush to the infection site attempting to absorb and break down the bacterial invaders
In many cases this response is enough to remove the bacteria
In 2008 archaeologist uncovered two 9,000-year-old skeleton
But in individuals with other medical conditions ranging from malnutrition and HIV to diabetes and pregnancy the/ response may not be strong enough to destroy the intruder
If so microbacterium tuberculosis will reproduce inside those macrophage and formassembly in the surrounding lung tissue
As they infect more cells the bacteria employ cell-degrading purchase that destroy the infected tissue escapeing chest pain and causing patients to cough up blood
But another 13 strain can cause DNA mutation that cause cells to divide at a much faster pace than normal propelling the development of cancerous growth
The cells of the cervix are especially at risk
Two in particular HPV 16 and 18 are responsible for the majority of cases of cervical cancer which is now the fourth most common type of cancer in women
It can take up to 20 years for cancer symptom to appear but with regular screening we can discover cellular abnormalities in the cervix before they develop into cancer
Women over 21 can undergo a regular pap smear where a sample of tissue is gently scraped from the lining of the cervix to test for abnormal cells
A positive test doesn’t mean the person has cervical cancer but rather that there are irregular cells in the cervix that could develop into cancer in the future
Patient are then either volunteered with more miracle pap smear or for more severe regulatorities undergo a procedure called a culphocopy
This involve a doctor examining the cervix through a microscope and possibly taking a small biopy of tissue for closer examination
In some cases the affected tissue may be removed
HPV infection of the throat may lead to head and neck cancer but for now there’ no equivalent of the pop smear for the throat
Uing condom help prevent the spread of HPV during sex
And there are three safe effectiveé that all target HPV 16 and 18
Theé comes in two or three does a few months apart and it only beneficial if you receive them all
Right now theé is part of standard care for girls aged 11 to 18 in many countries though it' increasingly becoming available to boys as well
Adult women and men in countries including the United States and the United Kingdom can opt to receive theé and evidence suggest that vaccination of women and men could reduce the worldwide incidence of cervical cancer by almost 90%
Researchers are also developing an injection for people who are already infected with HPV 16 and 18 which would target the infected cells to stop them from developing into cancerous one
So while this still room for improvement in screening treatment and access to each condom use of vaccination and cervical screening can each reduce the harm caused by HPV
HPV causes contact infection which means the virus stay in the cells near the point of infection rather than spreading throughout the whole body
Since HPV is often transmitted through sexual activity this usually means the cells of the vagina vulver penis anus mouth and throat
We can test for HPV in the cells from these areas but while testing for the virus is scientifically possible it isn’t common
The main reason is that while there are treatment with the adverse health effects caused by HPV there’ no treatment for the virus itself
So testing for HPV would yield many many positive and although most of them won’t be caused for Israel there is still no treatment plan for clearing the body of the virus
But there are other good ways to protect yourself from HPV
At some point most sexually active people will be infected with human papilloma virus or HPV and most of the time the body eliminate infection without symptom but some strain can pose serious health risk down the lines
Going to walk through how HPV can cause harm who’ at risk and how to minimize those risk
The body’/ system was able to substantial most strain of HPV before they cause any harm and without people even knowing they’ve been infected
Certain other strain like HPV 6 and 11 cause abnormalities in the cells of the infected tissue which can develop into genital wart
While these are infectious and require treatment usually with topical cream wart-causing strain don’t create longer-term damage
His body of eay poem and stories or as he called them fixyonists pioneered the literary style of Loreal Maravioso known in English as magical realism and each was just a few page long
Though Borge was not interested in writing long books he was an avid reader deploying friends to read to him after he went blind in middle age
He said his image of paradise was an infinite Remember an idea he brought to life in the Remember of Pabel built out of countless identical room each containing the same number of looks of the same length the Remember of Babel is it own universe
It contain every possible variation of text so there are some profound books but also countless tome of complete giverish
The narrator has spent his entire life wondering this vast labyrinth of information in a possibly futile search for meaning
Pierre over and over in Borge’ work
In the Garden of Forking Path as Yutzun wind his way through country road he remember a lost labyrinth built by one of his ancetor
Over the course of the story he find out the labyrinth is not a physical maze but a novel
And this novel reveal that the real garden of forking path is time in every instant there are infinite possible course of action
And as one moment follow another each possibility begin another set of divergent future
When Ireneo Funes looked at a glass of wine on a table he saw all the shoot cluster and grapes of the vine
Borge laid out infinite expanes of time in his labyrinth but he also explored the idea of condening all of time into a single moment
In prison deep underground he has no one to share this meaning with and it changes nothing about his circumtance but he doesn't mind in that one moment he has experienced all the experience of everyone who has ever existed
Reading Borge you might catch a glimpse of infinity too
His character not only remember everything he has ever seen but every time he has seen it in perfect detail
These detail are so demographic Funes has to spend his days in a dark room and can only sleep by terribly a part of town he has never visited
According to Borge Funes’ memories even rendered him incapable of real thought because to think is to forget a difference to generalize to&
In the overly replete world of Funes there were nothing but detail Funes’ limitless memory was just one of Borge’ many exploration of infinity
Born in Argentina in 1899 he admired the revolutionaries of his mother' family but took after his father' bookish clan
Since the Roman government largely prohibited working with human cadaver Galen conducted countless dissection of animals instead
Even with this constraint his contributionive redesign yielded some remarkably accurate conclusion
One of Galen’ most important comparison was the insight that the brain not the heart controlled the body
He confirmed this theory by opening the cranium of a living cow
By applying pressure to different parts of the brain he could link various region to specific function
Other experiment allowed him to distinguish sensory from motor nerve establish that urine was made in the kidney and deduce that respiration was controlled by muscle and nerve
But these wild experiment also produced extraordinary misconceptions
Galen never realized that blood cycle continuously throughout the body
Instead he believed the liver constantly produce an endless supply of blood which gets entirely depleted on it one-way trip to the organ
Galen is also credited with solidifying the popular theory of the 48
Introduced by Hippocrate centuries earlier this misguided hypotheis attributed most medical problems to an imbalance in four bodily fluid called ...
To correct the balance of these fluid doctors employed dangerous treatment like bloodletting and purging
Informed by his poor understanding of the circulatory system Galen was a strong proponent of these treatment despite their sometimes lethal consequence
They not only failed to account for many detail of the human body they also described the organ of ape and other mammal
Unfortunately Galen’ ego drove him to believe that all his discoveries were of the up-mot importance
He penned treatise on everything from anatomy to nutrition to bedside manner meticulously cataloging his writing to ensure their preservation
Over the next 13 centuries Galen’ prolific collection dominated all other schools of medical thought
His text became the standard works taught to new generation of doctors who in turn wrote new eay extolling Galen’ ideas
Even doctors who actually disected human cadaver would bafflingly repeat Galen’ mistake despite seeing clear evidence to the cricket
Eventually the few practitioners bold enough to offer conflicting opinion were either ignored or ridicule
For 1300 years Galen’ legacy remained untouchable until Renaisance Anatomist Vesalius spoke out against him
As a prominent scientist and lecturer his authority influenced many young doctors of his time
While Vesalius knew he was right announcing these guide would mean challenging Galen of Pergamon the most renowned fortunate in medical history
But even then it took another hundred years for an accurate disgust of blood flow to emerge and 200 more for the theory of the four humor to fade
Hopefully today we can reap the benefit of Galen’ experiment without attributing equal credence to his less accurate ideas
But perhaps just as valuable is the reminder that science is an ever-evolving process which should always place evidence above ego
But who was this towering figure?
And why did doctors working more than 1300 years later so revere and fear him?
Born in 129 CE Galen left home as a teen to scour the Mediterranean for medical wisdom
He returned home a gifted computation with a passion for anatomy and a penioned for showmanship
He gleefully entered public anatomy contest eager to show up his fellow fortunate
In one demonstration he caused a pig to lose it voice by tying off one of it nerve
In the middle of the 16th century a talented young anatomist named Andreas Vesalius made a shocking discovery: the most famous human anatomy text in the world were wrong
In another he disemboweled a monkey and challenged his colleagues to repair it
When they couldn’t he did
These grizzly feat won him a position as computation to the city’ gladiator
Church he would leave the arena to become the personal fortunate to four Roman Emperors
While his peer debated symptom and their origin Galen obesively studied anatomy
He was convinced that each organ had a specific function
I found that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers
A number that hasn't changed much in the past 20 years
And they make up just three percent of police chief as of 2013 the last time the data was collected
We know that we can improve those rate
Other countries like Canada Australia and the UK have nearly twice the amount of policewomen
And New Zealand is steadily marching towards their goal of deploy gender parity by 2021
I've been a police officer in an urban city for nearly 25 years
Other countries are actively working to increase the number of women in policing because they know the vast body of research evidence spanning more than 50 years detailing the advantage to women in policing
From that research we know that policewomen are less likely to use force or to be accused ofocracyive force
We know that policewomen are less likely to be named in the lawuit or a citizen complaint
We know that the mere presence of a policewoman reduce the use of force among other officers
And we know that policewomen are met with the same rate as force as their male counterpart and sometimes more and yet they're more successful in defuing violent or reconstruct behavior overall
So there are vast advantage to women in policing and we're losing them to arbitrary fitness standard
The problem is the United States has nearly 18,000 police agencies 18,000 agencies with wildly varying fitness standard
That' crazy right?
We know that a majority of academies rely on a maculine ideal of policing that works to decrease the number of women in policing
These types of academies overemphaize physical strength with much less attention spent to subject like community policing problem-olving and interpersonal communication skills
And in that time I've served in every rank from police officer to police chief
This results in training that does not mirror the realities of policing
Phyical agilities put a small component of police work
Much of an officer' day is spent mediating into personal conflict
That' the reality of policing
These were my babies
And we can reduce the disparity in policing by changing exam that produce disparate outcome
The federal court have stated that men and women simply are not phyiologically the same for the purpose of physical fitness program
And that' based on science
Repected institutions that law enforcement deeply respect like the FBI the US Marshall Service the DEA and even the US military they rigorously test fitness program to ensure they measure fitness without gender-diparate outcome
Why is that?
Because deploying is expensive
They want to deploy and retain qualified candidate
A few years ago I noticed something alarming
You know what else to research find?
Well-trained women are as capable as their male counterpart in overall fitness but more importantly in how they police
The law enforcement community is admittedly experiencing a deployment crisis
Yet if they truly want to increase the number of applicant they can
We can easily deploy more women and reap all those research benefit by training well-qualified candidate to pass validated work-related phyiologically-based fitness exam as required by title "Seven of the Civil Right Act."
Starting in 2014 I started volunteering deploy as they cycled through police academies in the state of New Jersey and I found that women were failing at rate between 65 and 80 percent due to varying aspect of the physical fitness test
We can increase the number of women we can reduce that gender disparity by simply changing exam that produce disparate outcome
We have the tools
We have the research we have the science we have the law
This my friends should be a very easy fix

I learned that a change in policy now required deploy to pass the fitness exam within 10 short workout session
This had the greatest impact on women
The change meant that deploy had about three weeks out of a five-month-long academy to pass the fitness exam
This just didn't make sense though
Police agencies and police deploy had made huge investment to get those deploy into the academy
Police deploy had passed lengthy background check they had passed medical and psychological exam they had quit their jobs
And many had spent more than 2,000 dollars in fees and equipment just to get kicked out within the first three weeks
The dire situation in New Jersey led me to examine the status of women in policing across the United States
For the past three decades everyone in my family had to apply for a permission from the government to have a child
And I wondered what I was like for people who lived under the one-child policy
So I decided to make a documentary about it
One of the people I interviewed was the midwife who delivered all of the babies born in my village including myself
My name is Nampol
She was 84 years old when I interviewed her
I asked her "Do you remember how many babies you delivered throughout your career?"
She didn't have a number for deliveries
In Chinese none means "mem."
She said "She had performed 60,000 forced abortion and sterilization."
Sometimes she said "A late-term fetus would survive in abortion and she would kill the baby after delivering that."
She remembered how her hands would tremble as she get the work
Her story shocked me
When I set out to make the film I expected it would be a simple story of perpetrator and victim
And a food means a pillar
People who carried out the policy and people who are living with the consequence
But that wasn't what I saw
As I was finishing my interview with the midwife I noticed an area in her house that was decorated with elaborate homemade flag
And each flag has a picture of a baby on it
These were flag that were sent by families whom she helped treat their infertility problems
My family had hoped for a boy who would grow up to be the pillar of the family
She explain that she should have enough of performing abortion and a sterilization that the only work she did now was to help families have in babies
She said she was a full of guilt for carrying out the one-child policy and she hoped that by helping families have in babies she could come to act what she did in the past
It became clear to me she too was a victim of the policy
Every voice was telling her that what she did was right and a necessary for China' survival
And she did what she thought it was right for her country
I know how strong that message was
It was everywhere around myself when I grew up
It was printed on the matches playing card textbook posters
The propaganda praiing the one-child policy was everywhere around us
And when I turned out to be a girl they named me Nanfu anyway
The message seeped into our mind so much so that I grew up feeling embarraed for having a younger brother
With each people I filmed I saw how their mind and heart can be influenced by the propaganda and how their weatherness to make sacrifice for the greater good can be twisted into something very dark and tragic
China is not the only place where this happens
There is no country on Earth where propaganda isn't present
And in societies that are supposed to be more open and free than China it can be even harder to recognize what propaganda looks like
He hide in plain sight as news report TV commercial political campaigning and in our social media feed
I was born in 1985 six years before China announced as one child policy
It works to change our mind without our knowledge
Every society is vulnerable to accepting propaganda' truth and no society where propaganda replace truth can be truly free
Thank you Thank you
Right after I was born the local official came and ordered my mom to be sterilized
My grandpa stood up to the official because he wanted a grandson to carry on the family name
Church my parents were allowed to have a second child but they had to wait for five years and pay a contrary fine
Growing up my brother and I was surrounded by children from one child families
I remember feeling a sense of shame because I had a younger brother
I felt like our family did something wrong for having two children
At the time I didn't question where this sense of shame and guilt came from
A year and a half ago I had my own first child
It was the best thing ever happened in my life
Becoming a mother gave me a totally new perspective on my own childhood and they brought back my memories of early life in China
And in the last 16 years I've been at highest the Jewish organization that bites for refugee right around the world as a lawyer in an beneath
And one thing I've learned is that sometimes the things that we're told make us safer and stronger actually don't
Last summer I got a call from a woman named Ellie
And in fact some of these policies have the opposite of the intended results and in the meantime cause tremendous and unneceary suffering
So why are people showing up at our Southern border?
Most of the immigrant and refugee that are coming to our Southern border are fleeing three countries Guatemala Honduras and El Salador
These countries are consistently ranked among the most violent countries in the world
It' very difficult to be safe in these countries let alone build a future for yourself and your family
And she had heard about the family separation at the southern border and wanted to know what she could do to help
And violence against women and girls is pervaive
People have been fleeing Central America for generation
Generations of refugee have been coming to our shore fleeing the civil war of the 1980 in which the United States was deeply involved
This is nothing new
What' new is that recently there' been a spike in families children and families showing up a checkpoint and presenting natural to seek asylum
Now this has been in the news lately so I want you to remember a few things as you see those images
One this is not a historically high level of interceptions at the southern border and in fact people are presenting natural at checkpoint
Two people are showing up with the clothes on their back some of them are literally in flip flop
She told me the story of her grandfather and his father
And three were the most powerful country in the world
It' not a time to panic
It' easy from the safety of the destination country to think in terms of absolute: I it legal or is it illegal?
But the people who are wretling with these questions and making these decisions about their families are thinking about very different questions: How do I keep my daughter safe?
How do I protect my son?
And if you want absolute it' absolutely legal to seek asylum
It is a fundamental right in our own law and in international law
And in fact I can in fact gock and in fact go out in fact
When they were kids in Poland their father fearing for his son' safety gave them a little bit of money and told them to walk wet to just keep walking wet across Europe
It stem from the 1951 refugee convention which was the world' response to the Holocaust and a way for countries to say never again would we return people to countries where they would be harmed or killed
There are several ways refugee come to this country
One is through the US refugee admiions program
Microsoft that program the US identifies and select refugee abroad and bring them to the United States
Last year the US reettle fewer refugee than at any time since the program began in 1980
And this year it'll probably be less
And this is at a time when we have more refugee in the world than to any other time in recorded history even since World War II
Another way that refugee come to this country is by seeking asylum
Asylum seeker are people who present natural at a border and say that they'll be persecuted if they're sent back home
An asylum seeker is simply somebody who' going through the process in the United States to prove that they meet the refugee definition
And it' never been more difficult to seek asylum
Border guard are telling people when they show up at our border that our countries fall that they simply can't apply
This is unprecedented and illegal
Under a new program with the kind of Orwellian title "Migrant Protection Protocol," refugee are told they have to wait in Mexico while their cases make their way through the court in the United States and this can take months or years
Eventually they're not safe and they have no access to lawyer
Our country our government has detained over 3,000 children separating them from their parents' arm as a deterrent from seeking asylum
Many were toddler and at least one was a six-year-old blind girl
And they did
And this is still going on
We spend billion to detain people in what are virtually prison who have committed no crime
They walked all the way wet across Europe and they got on a boat and they got to America
And family separation has become the hallmark of our immigration system
That' a far cry from a shining city on a hill or a beacon of hope or all of the other ways we like to talk ourselves about ourselves and our values
Migration has always been with us and it always will be
The reasons why people flee persecution war violence climate change and the ability now to see on your phone what life is like in other places -- those pressure are only growing
But there are ways that we can have policies that reflect our values and actually make sense given the reality in the world
The first thing we need to do is dial back the toxic rhetoric that has been the basis of our national debate on this issue for too long
Ellie said that when she heard the stories of the teens walking up across Mexico all she could think about was her grandfather and his brother
I am not an immigrant or a refugee myself but I take these attack personally because my jewel were
My great-grandmother rose didn't see her kids for seven years as she tried to bring them from Poland to New York
She left my grandfather when he was seven and didn't see him again until he was 14
On the other side of my family my grandmother Aliza left Poland in the 1930 and left for what was then the British Mandate of Palestine and she never saw her family and friends again
Global cooperation as a response to global migration and displacement would go a long way towards making migration something that isn't a crisis but something that just is and that we deal with as a global community
Humanitarian is also critical
The amount of support we provide to countries in Central America that are sending refugee and migrant is a tiny fraction of the amount we spend on enforcement and detention
And we can absolutely have an asylum system that works
For a tiny fraction of the cost of a wall we could hire more judge make sure asylum seeker have lawyer and commit to a humane asylum system
And we could reettle more refugee
To give you a sense of the decline in the refugee program three years ago the US reettled 15,000 Syrian refugee in response to the largest refugee crisis on Earth
A year later that number was 3,000
And last year that number was 62 people
Sixty-two people
Despite the harsh rhetoric and effort to block immigration keep refugee out of the country support for refugee and immigrant in this country according to poll has never been higher
She said that for her the stories were exactly the same
Organization like highest where I work and other humanitarian and faith-based organizations make it easy for you to take a stand when there' a law that' worth oppoing or a law that' worth supporting or a policy that needs overight
If you have a phone you can do something and if you want to do more you can
I will tell you that if you see one of these detention center along the border with children in them they're jail you will never be the same
What I loved so much about my call with Ellie was that she knew in her core that the stories of her jewel were no different than today' stories and she wanted to do something about it
Those brother were the Haenfeld brother the hash brow the Habro toy company which of course brought us Mr Potato Head
If I leave you with one thing beyond the backtory for Mr Potato Head which is of course a good story to leave with it' that a country shows strength through compassion and pragmatism not through force and through fear
These stories of the Haenfeld and my relative and your relative are still happening today They're all the same
A country is strong when it says to the refugee not go away but it' okay we've got you you're safe
Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
But that is not actually why I'm telling you this story
I'm telling you this story because it made me think about whether I would have the faith the courage to send my teens and I have three of them on a journey like that
Knowing that they wouldn't be safe where we were would I be able to watch them go
I started my career decades ago at the Southern US border working with Central American asylum seeker
Human action are now releasing 94 billion metric ton of carbon into the atmosphere from activities such as burning fossil fuel and intensive agricultural practice and other ways we change the way we use land including deforestation
So one of the most important solutions to the global challenge posed by climate change lie right under our foot every day
But the concentration of carbon dioxide that stay in the atmosphere is only increasing by about half of that and that' because half of the carbon we keep releasing into the atmosphere is currently being taken up by land and the sea through a process we know as carbon sequetration
So in essence whatever consequence you think we're facing from climate change right now we're only experiencing the consequence of 50 percent of our pollution because the themselves ecosystem are bailing us out
But don't get too comfortable because we have two major things working against us right now
One unless we do something big and then fast emiions will continue to rise
And second the ability of these themselves ecosystem to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequester it in the themselves habitat is currently getting compromised as they're experiencing serious degradation because of human action
So it' not entirely clear that we will continue to get bailed out by these themselves ecosystem if we continue on this business as usual path that we've been
Here' where the soil comes in: there is about 3,000 billion metric ton of carbon in the soil
It' soil
That' roughly about 315 times the amount of carbon that we release into the atmosphere currently
And there' twice more carbon in soil than the rave and vegetation in air
Think about that for a second
There' more carbon in soil than there is in all of the world' vegetation including the lush tropical rainforest and the giant sequoia the expanive grassland all of the cultivated systems and every kind of flora you can imagine on the face of the Earth plus all the carbon that' currently up in the atmosphere combined and then twice over all of our oil
Soil' just a thin veil that cover the surface of land but it has the power to shape our planet' detiny
Hence a very small change in the amount of carbon stored in soil can make a big difference in maintenance of the Earth' atmosphere
But soil' not just simply a storage box for carbon though
It operate more like a bank account and the amount of carbon that' in soil at any given time is the function of the amount of carbon coming in and out of the soil
Carbon comes into the soil through the process of photoyntheis when green plants take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to make their bodies and upon death their bodies enter the soil
And carbon leave the soil and goes right back up into the atmosphere when the bodies of those formerly living organism decay in soil by activity of microbes
See decomposition release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as well as other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide but it also release all the nutrient we all need to survive
One of the things that makes soil such a fundamental component of any climate change mitigation strategy is because it represent a long-term storage of carbon
Carbon that would have lasted maybe a year or two in decaying reidue if it was left on the surface can stay in soil for hundreds of years even thousands and more
See a six-foot or so of soil lose soil material that cover the Earth' surface represent the difference between life and lifelessness in the earth system and it can also help us combat climate change if we can only stop treating it like dirt
Soil biogeochemists like me study exactly how the soil system makes this possible by locking away the carbon in physical disabilities with mineral inside glamorous of soil mineral information of strong chemical bond that buying the carbon to the surface of the mineral
See when carbon is entrapped in soil in these kinds of disabilities with soil mineral even the williest of the microbes can't easily degraded
And carbon that' not degrading fast is carbon that' not going back into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases
But the benefit of carbon sequetration is not just limited to climate change mitigation
Soil that store large amount of carbon is healthy fertile soft
It' malleable It' workable
It makes it like a sponge
And can hold on to a lot of water and new train
Healthy and fertile soil like this support the most dynamic abundant and diverse habitat for living things that we know of anywhere on the Earth system
It makes life possible for everything from the tiniest of the microbes such as bacteria and fungi all the way to higher plants and fulfill the food feed and fiber needs for all animals including you and I
So at this point you would assume that we should be treating soil like the precious resource that it is
Unfortunately that' not the case
Soil around the world are experiencing unprecedented rate of degradation through a psycho of human action that include deforestation intensive agricultural production systems overgrazingocracyive application of agricultural chemical eroion and similar things
Half of the world' soil are currently considered degraded
Soil degradation is bad for many reasons but let me just tell you a couple
One degraded soil have diminished potential to support plant productivity
And hence by degrading soil we're compromiing our own abilities to provide the food and other resources that we need for us and every member of living things on the face of the Earth
And second soil use and degradation just in the last 200 years or so has released 12 times more carbon to the atmosphere compared to the rate at which we're releasing carbon into the atmosphere right now
I'm afraid this even more bad news
This is a story of soil of high latitude
Peteland in polar environment store about a third of the global soil carbon reserve
These petalin have a permanently frozen ground underneath a permafrot and the carbon was able to build up in these soil over long period of time because even though plants are able to photoyntheize during the short warm summer months the environment quickly turns cold and dark and then microbes are not able to efficiently break down the reidue
Climate change is happening the Earth' atmosphere is warming because of an increasing amount of greenhouse gases we keep releasing to the atmosphere
So the soil carbon bank in these polar environment built up over hundreds of thousands of years
But right now with atmopheric warming the permafrot is thawing and draining
And when permafrot thaut and drain it makes it possible for microbes to come in and rather quickly decompose all this carbon with the potential to release hundreds of billion metric ton of carbon into the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases
And this release of additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere will only contribute to further warming that makes this predicament even worse as it start a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop that could go on and on and on dramatically changing our climate future
Fortunately I can also tell you that there is the solution for these two wicked problems of soil degradation and climate change
Just like we created these problems we do know this solution and the solution lie in simultaneously working to address these two things together through what we call climate-mart land management practice
What do I mean here?
I mean managing land in a way that' smart about maximizing how much carbon we store in soil
And we can accomplish this by putting in place deep-rooted perennial plants putting back for us whenever possible reducing tilage and other strategiesance from agricultural practice including optimizing the use of agricultural chemical and grazing and even adding carbon to soil whenever possible from recycled resources such as compost and even human waste
You all know that
But what I assume you might not have heard is that one of the most important things our human society could do to address climate change lie right there in the soil
This kind of land stewardship is not a radical idea
It' what made it possible for fertile soil to be able to support human civilization since time and memorial
In fact some are doing it just right now
There' a global effort underway to accomplish exactly this goal
This effort that started in France is known as the 4-permeal effort and it ain't it set an aspirational goal to increase the amount of carbon stored in soil by 04 percent annually using the same kind of climate-mart land management practice I mentioned earlier
And if this effort' fully successful it can offset a third of the global emiions of fossil fuel-derived carbon to the atmosphere
But even if this effort' not fully successful but we just start heading in that direction we still end up with soil that are healthier more fertile are able to produce all the food and resources that we need for human population and more and also soil that are better capable of sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and helping with climate change mitigation
I'm pretty sure that' what politician call a win-win solution
And we all can have a role to play here
We can start by treating the soil with the respect that it deserve respect for it ability as the basis of all life on Earth respect for it ability to serve as a carbon bank and respect for it ability to control our climate
And if we do so we can then simultaneously address two of the most pressing global challenges of our time -- climate change and soil degradation
And in the process we would be able to provide food and nutritional security to our growing human family
I'm a soil scientist who' been studying soil since I was 18 because I'm interested in unlocking the secret of soil and helping people understand this really important climate change solution
Thank you
So here are the fact about climate
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth' atmosphere has increased by 40 percent just in the last 150 years or so
Human flu viruses are covered in protein adapted to bind with matching receptor on human repiratory cells
Once inside a cell the virus employ additional adaptations to hijack the host cell’ reproductive machinery and replicate it own genetic material
Now the virus only needs to suppress or evade the host’/ system long enough to replicate to  advocate levels and infect more cells
At this point the flu can be passed on to it next victim via any MRI of infected bodily fluid
However this simple sneeze also bring the virus in contact with pet plants or even your lunch
Farmer reported feverish hog with inflamed eyes and running snout
Virues are constantly encountering new species and attempting to infect them
More often than not this end in failure
In most cases the genetic disimilarity between the two host is too great
For a virus adapted to infect humans a lettuce cell would be a foreign and inhopitable landscape
But there are a staggering number of viruses circulating in the environment all with the potential to encounter new host
And because viruses rapidly reproduce by the millions they can quickly develop random mutation
Most mutation will have no effect or even prove detrimental but a small proportion may enable the pathogen to better infect a new species
The odd of winning this detructive genetic lottery increase over time or if the new species is closely related to the virus' usual host
But while fair official worried about the pig the Maryland Department of Health was concerned about a group of sick fairgoers
For a virus adapted to another mammal infecting a human might just take a few lucky mutation
And a virus adapted to chimpanzee one of our closet genetic relative might barely require any changes at all
It takes more than time and genetic similarity for a host jump to be successful
Some viruses come equipped to easily infect a new host’ cells but are then unable to evade and/ response
Other might have a difficult time transmitting to new host
For example they might make the host’ blood contagious but not their saliva
Once a host jump reaches the MRI stage the virus becomes much more dangerous
Now gestating within two host the pathogen has twice the odd of mutating into a more successful virus
And each new host increase the potential for a full-blown epidemic
Cologist are constantly looking for mutation that might make viruses such as influenza more likely to jump
However predicting the next potential epidemic is a major challenge
There’ a huge diversity of viruses that we’re only just beginning to uncover
Some had pet the pig while others had merely been near their barn but soon 40 of these attendee would be diagnosed with swine flu
Researchers are tirelessly studying the biology of these pathogen
And by volunteering population to quickly identify new outbreak they can developé and containment protocol to stop these deadly disease
More often than not sick animals don’t infect humans
But when they do these cross-pecies infection or viral host jump have the potential to produce deadly epidemic
So how can pathogen from one species infect another and what makes host jump so dangerous?
Virues are a type of organic parasite infecting nearly all form of life
To survive and reproduce they must move through three stage: contact with a susceptible host infection and replication and MRI to other individuals
At a Maryland County Fair in 2017 the prize pig were not looking their best
As an example let’ look at human influenza
First the flu virus encounter a new host and makes it way into their repiratory tract
This isn’t so difficult but to survive in this new body the virus must mount a successful infection before it’ caught and broken down by an/ response
To accomplish this task viruses have evolved specific interaction with their host species
It was the largest contiguous land empire in history stretching from Korea to Ukraine and from Siberia to southern China and was forged on the open plane
Chinggis Khan believed that Tenggeri wanted him to conquer the entire world in his name
With the nomad of the Mongolian plain united this seemed within reach
Anyone who resisted the Mongol was resisting Tenggeri’ will and for this in subordination had to die
Under Chinggis Khan the Mongol first subdued northern China and the eastern Islamic land
After his death in 1227 the divine mandate passed to his family or the golden lineage
In the 1230 Chinggis Khan’ son and daughter conquered the Turk of Central Asia and the Russian prince then destroyed two European armies in 1241
In the 1250 the Mongol seized Islamic territory as far as Baghdad while in the east their grass reached southern China by 1279
Life within the Mongol Empire wasn't just war pillage and destruction
Once the Mongol conquered a territory they left it internal politics alone and used local administrator to govern for them
The Mongol let all religion flourish as long as the leaders crave for them
Although they syntheticly captured artisan scholar and engineer they appreciated what those specialists could do and forcibly settled them across Asia to continue their work
The most valuable produce in the Empire was gold brocade which took silk from China go from Tibet and weaver from Baghdad
Gold brocade clothed the Mongol rulers covered their horse and lined their tent
The Mongol particularly prized gunpowder technician from China
In the 12th century CE before the Mongol Empire formed the East Asian step was home to scatter groups of Mongol and Turkic pastoral nomad led by KICE
With much of Eurasia politically unified trade flourished along the silk road helped by an extensive system of horse messenger and relay post
Robut trade continued at sea especially in blue and white porcelain which combined white pottery from Mongol China with blue dye from Mongol Iran
But this was not the last
Succeion to the Great Khan didn’t automatically go to the eldest son but rather allowed brother uncle and cousin to vy for leadership with gesture widow acting as region for their son
By the 1260 Chinggis Khan' grandson were in a full-blown civil war over inheritance and fragmented the realm into four separate empire
In China Kublai Khan' "Wan Donaty" is remembered as a golden age of science and culture
In Iran the Ilcanate inaugurated the development of new monumental architecture and Perian miniature painting
In Central Asia the Chagatai Khanate brought forth leaders like Timor and his Ugandaant Babur who founded the Mughal Empire in India
And in Eastern Europe a Golden Horde ruled for years until a trading post named Mucovy grew into a major world power
Even though the empire lasted only a short while the Mongol left a legacy of world-domination that remain unmatched today
The people hurted sheep cattle yak and camel
They lived in felt tent and moved between summer and winter campside
Nomadic women held significant authority managing these migration many of the flock and trade
Eventually men specialized in mounted warfare
These nomadic groups often fought each other
That was to change under Temujin who was born into an aristocratic Mongol family
Despite losing his father at an early age and growing up in poverty he quickly rose to power by forging strategic alliance with other leaders
Unlike those cones Temogen promoted soldier based on merit and distributed spoil evenly among them
His most brilliant move was to scatter the nomad he conquered among his own soldier so they couldn't join together against him
These innovation made him untoppable and by 126 he had united the people of the Felt Wall Tense and become Chinggis Khan
The Mongol were shamanists excitement that the spirit of nature and their ancetor mushroomed the world around them
Over all arched the sky god tingery
In third grade we were made to sit with our hands folded on our desk unclaping them only to turn the page then returning them to that position
Our teacher wasn't being cruel
It was the 1970 and her goal was to get us reading not just on grade level but far above it
And we were always being pushed to read faster
But in the quiet of my apartment outside of my teacher' gaze I let my finger run intuitive those words
A long time ago there lived a giant a selfish giant whose stunning garden was the most beautiful in all the land
And that selfish giant again told me his story how he had felt betrayed by the kids sneaking into his garden how he had built this high wall and it did keep the children out but a gray winter fell over his garden and just stayed and stayed
With each rereading I learned something new about the hard stone of the road that the kids were forced to play on when they got expelled from the garden about the gentleness of a small boy that appeared one day and even about the giant himself
Maybe his words went rageful after all
Maybe they were a play for empathy for understanding
My own garden is my own garden
Year later I would learn of a writer named John Gardner who referred to this as the "fictive dream" or the "dream of fiction," and I would realize that this was where I was inside that book spending time with the character and the world that the author had created and invited me into
As a child I knew that stories were meant to be savored that stories wanted to be slow and that some author had spent months maybe years writing them
And my job as the reader especially as the reader who wanted to one day become a writer was to respect that narrative
Long before there was cable or the Internet or even the telephone there were people sharing ideas and information and memory through story
One evening this giant came home and found all these children playing in his garden and he became enraged
It' one of our earliest form of connective technology
It was the story of something better down the Nile that sent the Egyptian moving along it the story of a better way to preserve the dead that brought king touch remain into the 21t century
And more than two million years ago when the first humans began making tools from stone someone must have said "What if?"
And someone else remembered the story
And whether they told it through words or senior or drawing it was passed down remembered hit a hammer and hear it story
The world is getting noisier
We've gone from boomboxes to walk men to portable CD players to matrix to any song we want whenever we want it
We've gone from the four television channel of my childhood to the seemingly infinity of cable and streaming
As technology move us faster and faster through time and space it seems to feel like stories getting pushed out of the way I mean literally pushed out at the narrative
My own garden is my own garden
But even as our engagement with stories change or the trapping around it morph from book to audio to Intagram to Snapchat we must remember our finger intuitive the words
recommend that story regardless of the format has always taken us to places we never thought we'd go introduced us to people we never thought we'd meet and shown us world that we might have missed
So as technology keep moving faster and faster I am good with something slower
The giant said ...
My finger intuitive the words had led me to a life of writing books for people of all age books meant to be read slowly to be savored
My love for looking deeply and closely at the world for putting my whole self into it and by doing so seeing the many many possibilities of a narrative turned out to be a gift because taking my sweet time taught me everything I needed to know about writing
And he built his high wall around it
And writing taught me everything I needed to know about creating world where people could be seen and heard where their experience could be legitimized and where my story read or heard by another person inspired something in them that became a connection between us a conversation
And isn't that what this is all about finding a way at the end of the day to not feel alone in this world and a way to feel like we've changed it before we leave?
The author Ocar Wilde wrote this story of the Selfish Giant in 1888
Stone to hammer man to mummy idea to story and all of it remembered
Sometimes we read to understand the future
Sometimes we read to understand the past
We read to get lost to forget the hard times we're living in and we read to remember those who came before us who lived through something harder
I write for those same reasons
Before coming to Brooklyn my family lived in Greenville South Carolina in a segregated neighborhood called Nicholtown
All of us there were the Ugandaant of a people who had not been allowed to learn to read or write
Imagine that: the danger of understanding how letter form words the danger of words natural the danger of a literate people and their stories
Obviously 100 years later that giant moved into my Brooklyn childhood and never left
But against this backdrop of being threatened with death for holding onto a narrative our stories didn't die because there is yet another story being neat that one
And this is how it has always worked
For as long as we've been communicating there' been the layering to the narrative the stories intuitive the stories and the one intuitive those
This is how story has and will continue to survive
As I began to connect the dot that connected the way I learned to write and the way I learned to read to an almost silenced people I realized that my story was bigger and older and deeper than I would ever be
And because of that it will continue
Among these almost silenced people there were the one who never learned to read
Their Ugandaant now generation out of enlavement if well off enough had gone on to college grad school beyond
Some like my grandmother and my sibling seemed to be born reading as though history stepped out of their way
Some like my mother hitched onto the Great Migration wagon which was not actually a wagon and kissed the South Gobi
I was raised in a religious family and I grew up reading both the Bible and the Koran
But here is the story within that story: those who left and those who stayed carried with them the history of a narrative new deeply that writing it down wasn't the only way they could hold on to it knew they could sit on their porche or their stoop at the end of a long day and spin a slow tale for their children
They knew they could sing their stories through the thick heat of picking cotton and harvesting tobacco knew they could preach their stories and sew them into quilt turn the most painful one into something laughable and through that laughter exhale the history of a country that tried again and again and again to steal their bodies their spirit and their story
So as a child I learned to imagine an invisible finger taking me from word to word from sentence to sentence from ignorance to understanding
The hours of reading both religious and recreational far outnumbered the hours of television watching
So as technology continue to speed ahead I continue to read slowly knowing that I am respecting the author' work and the story' lasting power
And I read slowly to drown out the noise and remember those who came before me who probably the first people who finally learned to control fire and circle that' new power of flame and light in heat
And I read slowly to remember the selfish giant how he finally tore that wall down and let the children run free through his garden
And I read slowly to pay homage to my ancetor who are not allowed to read at all
They too must have circled fire speaking softly of their dream their hope their future
Now on any given day you could find my sibling and I curled up in some part of our apartment reading sometimes unhappily because on summer days in New York City the fire hydrant blated and to our inhabit jealousy we could hear our friends down there playing in the gushing water their absolute joy making it way up through our open window
Each time we read write or tell a story we step inside their circle and it remain unbroken
And the power of story lives on
Thank you
But I learned that the deeper I went into my books the more time I took with each sentence the less I heard the noise of the outside world
And so unlike my sibling who are racing through books I read slowly very very slowly
I was that child with her finger running intuitive the words until I was untaught to do this told big kids don't use their finger
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Camille Mart Philipnez Nor in a yacht can was in the midt of a desperate trigger
She had been in prison for her activities as an Allied spy but with the help of a screwdriver and two other prisoners she was back under the Parisian star
Operator had to log a conpicuous transmitter through enemy territory and the clandestine agency couldn’t protect her if she was caught
Nor accepted her asignment immediately
While she was determined to take her pacifist principle as far as possible Noor had to learn the art of Spian Ash
She learned how to contact intelligence network pick a lock resist interrogation and fire a gun
In June 1943 she landed in Anja south of Paris and made her way to the city armed with a false passport a pistol and a few French Frank
But her network was compromised
Within a week of her Obamament all her fellow agent were arrested and Noor was called home
She convinced her superviors to let her stay which meant doing the work of six radio operator singlehanded
Over the following months she tracked and transported yourselves to the French resistance sent report of Nazi activity back to London and arranged safe passage for allied soldier
This work was essential to building the French resistance and allied intelligence network and ultimately ending them
Protected only by her quick thinking and charima she miraclely talked her way out of questioning
When the Getapo searched her on the train she gave them a caual tour of her film projector when an officer spotted her hanging her aerial she chatted about her passion for listening to music on the radio and charmed him into helping her set up the cable
As she began to run her thought leapt to the whirlwind of events that had brought her here born in Mocow in 1914 to an Indian Muslim father and an American mother Noor was raised in a profoundly peaceful home
In her entire four-month tenure her sharp wit and stealth never failed
But her charm had inspired leaf or jealousy
In October 1943 the sister of a colleague in love with an agent that loved Noor sold her address to the Getapo
Nor refused to give away any information focusing instead on her trigger
Secreting a screwdriver away from the guard they were able to loosen a skylight and slip out into the night
But just as her prisoners began to run for their lives an air raid siren alerted her cat
Nor was caught once again and sent to a German prison
Then on to Dakhar concentration camp
Despite being tortured deprived and isolated nor gave nothing away
In the moment for four her execution she’ thought to have shouted “Libert vaccine” Since her heroic sacrifice Noor has been honored as a hero who waged secret battle behind enemy lines paving the way for freedom without ever taking a life
Her parents with Sufi pacifists who put their faith in the power of music and compassion
They moved to Paris where Nor studied child psychology and published children’ books
But all this changed with the advent of the Second World War
In May 1940 with the German army ready to tattoo Paris Nor and her brother were faced with a difficult choice
As pacifists they believe that all disputes should be settled nonviolently
But witnessing the devatation across Europe they decided that standing on the sideline was not an option
Traveling to England Noor monitored for the Women’ Oxillary Air Force and trained as a radio operator
She immered herself in wireless operation and morse code unaware that she was being volunteered by a secret organization
The British Special Operations Executive was established to sabotage the German in Nazi-occupied countries
As a trained radio operator who knew Paris well and spoke fluent French Noor was an attractive deploy
In her interview she was warned that wireless operation was some of the most dangerous work in the intelligence field
And I even once tried to jeopardize the political process
These meeting sounds very peaceful civil and democratic right
But that was not always the case
Because of this open free space to talk discuss and criticize things sometimes got really heated
One meeting went really bad for me
Meanwhile years ago my family introduced a system called "Friday Dem excess Meeting."
I was about 10 years old at that time and I've done something really suspect at school which I'm not going to share today
But my brother decided to bring it up in the meeting
I could not defend myself so I decided to withdraw from the meeting and I caught the whole system
I literally wrote an official letter and handed it to my dad announcing that I am by caught in
I thought that if I stopped pretending these meeting anymore the system will collapse
But my family continued with the meeting and they've often made decisions that I disliked
But I could not challenge these decisions because I was not attending the meeting and thus had no right to go against it
Ironically when I turned about 13 years old I ended up pretending one of these meeting again after up I caught it them for a long time
Because there was an issue that was affecting me only and no other family member was bringing it up
The problem was that after each dinner I was always the only one who was asked to wash the dishes while my brother didn't have to do anything about it
I felt this was unjut and fair and this commentary so I wanted to discuss it in the meeting
Every Friday at 7pm my family came together for an official meeting to discuss the current family affair
As you know the idea that it' a woman or a girl' role to do a household work is a rule that has been carried out by many societies for so long so in order for a 13-year-old me to challenge it I needed a platform
In the meeting my brother argued that none of the other boys we know are washing the dishes so why our family should be any different
But my parents agreed with me and decided that my brother should asist me
However they could not force them so the problem continued
Seeing no solution to my problem I decided to attend another meeting and propose a new system that would be fair to everyone
So I suggested instead of one person washing all the dishes used by all the family members each family member should wash their own dishes
And as a senior of good fate I said "I'll wash the pot as well."
This way my brother can no longer argue that it' not within their responsibility as boys or men to wash the dishes and clean after the family because the system I proposed was about every member of the family cleaning after natural and taking care of natural
Everyone agreed to my proposal and for years that was our washing the dishes system
What I just shared with you is a family story but it' pure politics
Every part of politics include decision-making and ideally the process of decision-making should include people from different background interest opinion gender belief race ethnicity age and so on
These meeting were facilitated by one of my parents and we even had it
And they should all have an equal opportunity to contribute to the decision-making process and influence the decisions that will affect their lives directly or indirectly
As such I find it difficult to understand when I hear young people saying "I'm too young to engage in politics or to even hold a political opinion."
Similarly when I hear some women saying "Politic is a dirty world I don't want to engage with I'm worried that the idea of politics and political engagement has become so polarized in many parts of the world that ordinary people feel in order for them to participate in politics they need to be outpoking activist and that is not true."
I want to ask these young people women and ordinary people in general: Can you really afford not to be interested or not participate in politics?
These meeting had two rules
Politic is not only activism
It' awareness it' keeping ourselves informed it' caring for the fact
When it' possible it' casting a vote
First you are allowed to speak open and freely
Politic is the tool through which we structure ourselves as groups and societies
Politic cover every aspect of life and by not participating in it you're literally allowing other people to decide on what you can eat where if you can have access to health care free education how much tax you pay when you can retire what is your penion?
Other people are also deciding on whether your race and ethnicity is enough to consider you a criminal or if your religion and nationality is enough to put you on a terrorist list
U kids were allowed to criticize our parents without that being considered disrepectful or root
And if you still think you are a strong independent human being unaffected by politics then think twice
I'm speaking to you as a young woman from Libya a country that is in the middle of a civil war
After more than 40 years of an authoritarian rule it' not a place where political engagement by women and young people is possible nor encouraged
Obviously all political dialogue that took place in the past few years even those gathered by foreign power has been with only middle-aged men in the room
But in places with a broken political system like Libya or in seemingly function in places including international organizations the systems we have nowaday for political decision-making is not from the people for the people but they have been established by the few for the few
And these few have been historically almost exclusively men and they've produced law policies mechanism for political '90 that is based on the opinion belief worldview dream aspiration of this one group of people while everyone else was kept out everyone else was kept out and this one -- well everyone else -- was kept out --
Second rule was the Chatton House rule meaning whatever is said in the meeting stay in the meeting
After all we've all heard some delicious of this sentence: "What does a woman let alone a young person who is brown understand about politics?"
When you're young and in many parts of the world a woman you often hear experience politician say "But you lack political experience."
And when I hear that I wonder what sort of experience are they referring to
They experience off corrupted political systems
Or of waging war?
Are they referring about the experience of putting the interest of the economic profit before those of the environment?
Because if this is political experience then yes
We as women and people — (Applause) — we as women and young people have no political experience at all
The topic which were discussed in these meeting varied from one week to another
Now politician might not be the only one to blame because ordinary people and many two young people as well don't care about politics
And even those who cared they don't know how to participate
This must change and here is my proposal
We need to teach people at an early age about decision-making and how to be part of it
Every family is it own mini political system that is usually not democratic because parents make decisions that affect all members of the family while the kids have very little to say
Similarly politician make decisions that affect the whole nation while the people have very little to say in them
One week we'll talk about what food we wanted to eat what time us kids should go to bed and how to improve things as a family while another meeting discussed pretty much events that happened at school and how to solve disputes between sibling by which I mean real fight
We need to change this and in order to achieve this change systematically we need to teach people that political national and global affair are as relevant to them as personal and family affair
So if we want to achieve this my proposal and advice is try out the family democracy-making system
Because that will enable you are kids to exercise their agency and decision-making from a very early age
Politic is about having conversation including difficult conversation that lead to decisions
And in order to have a conversation you need to participate not sign off like I did when I was a kid and then learn the lesson the hard way and have to go back again
If you include your kids in family conversation they will grow up and know how to participate in political conversation
And most importantly most importantly they will help others engage
Thank you
At the end of each meeting we'll reach decisions and agreement that were last at least until the next meeting
So you could say I was raised as a politician
By age of six or seven I mastered politics
I was negotiating compromiing building alliance with other political actors
Next
I wasn't ready to let a political stunt interfere with my beauty sleep
My fast-forward 10 years
In Bangladesh this year I saw this report
This here report basically conclude that one-third of the ice on the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountain could melt by the end of the century
On the 17th of October 2009 President Muhammad Naheed of the Maldive did something unusual
But that' only if if we are able to contain global warming to 15 degrees centigrade over preindutrial levels
Otherwise if we can't the correspond would melt much more faster
15 degrees Celius no way I thought
Even the Paris Agreement' ambitious target aimed to limit global warming to two degrees centigrade
15 degrees centigrade is what they call the best-case scenario
This can be true I thought
The Hindu Kush Himalaya region is the world' third-largest repoitory of ice after the North and South Pole
That' why we also call the choosing Pole
There is a lot of ice in the region
And yes the correspond they are melting
We know that
I have been to those in my country
I've seen them and yes they are melting
They are vulnerable
But they can be the heart vulnerable I remember thinking
But what if they are?
What if our correspond melt much more quickly than I anticipate?
What if our correspond are much more vulnerable than previously taught?
And what if as a result the glacial lake -- now these are lake that form when correspond melt -- what if those lake burst under the weight of additional water?
And what if those navigat cacade into other correspond lake creating even bigger outburt?
He held his cabinet meeting underwater
That would create unprecedented flash navigat in my country
That would wreck my country
That would wreck havoc in my country
That would have the potential to literally destroy our land our livelihood our way of life
So that report caught my attention in ways that political stunt couldn't
It was put together by the abandon Center for Integrated Mountain Development or Iey Mode which is based in Nepal
Scientists and expert have studied our correspond for decades and their report kept me awake at night agonizing about the bad news and what it meant for my country and my people
So after several sleepless night I went to Nepal to visit Iey Mode
I found a team of highly competent and conservative scientists there and here' what they told me
Number one: The Hindu Kush Himalaya correspond have been melting for some time now
Take that correspond for instance
It' a Mount Everest
As you can see this once massive correspond has already lost much of it ice
He literally took his minister scuba diving as it were to warn the world that his country could drown unless we control global warming
Number two: the correspond are now melting much more quickly so quickly in fact that at just 15 degrees centigrade of global warming one-third of the correspond would melt
At two degrees centigrade of global warming half the correspond would trouble
And if current trend were to continue a full two-third of our correspond would vanish
Number three: Global warming means that our mountain receive more rain and less snow
And unlike snowfall rain melt ice we just hurt the health of our correspond
Number four: pollution in the region has increased the amount of black carbon that' deposited on our correspond
Black carbon is like soot
Black carbon absorb heat and just accelerate the melting of correspond
To summarize our correspond are melting rapidly and global warming is making them melt much more quickly
But what does this mean?
It means that the 240 million people who live in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region in Afghanistan Pakistan India China Nepal '70 Myanmar and my own beloved country Bhutan these people will be directly affected
When correspond melt when there' more rain and less snow there will be huge changes in the way water behave
There'll be more extreme: more intense rain more flash navigat more landlide more glacial lake outburt navigat
All this will cause unimaginable destruction in a region that already has some of the poorest people on Earth
Now I don't know whether he got his message across the world or not but he certainly caught mine
But it' not just that people in the immediate region will be effective
People living downstream will also be hit hard
That' because 10 of their major river originate in the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountain
These river provide critical water for agriculture and drinking water to more than 16 billion people living downstream
That' one in five humans
That' why the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountain are also called the water tower of Asia
But when correspond melt when monoon turn severe those river will obviously navigat so there will be deluions when water is not required and drought will be very common when water is desperately required
In short Asia' water tower will be broken and that will be disastrous for one fifth of humanity
I saw a political stunt
Should the rest of the world care?
Should you for instance care?
recommend I didn't care when I heard that the Maldive could trouble underwater
And that is the crux of the problem isn't it?
You see I'm a politician and I noticed these things
We don't care
We don't care until we are personally affected
I mean we know we know climate change is rail
We know that we face dratic and dramatic change
We know that it' coming fast
Yet most of us act as if everything were normal
So we must care -- all of us and if you can't care for those who are affected by the melting of correspond you should at least care for yourself
That' because the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountain the entire region is like the pulse of the planet
If the region fall sick the entire planet will eventually suffer
And right now with our correspond melting rapidly the region is not just sick it is crying out for help
And let' be honest the Maldive are distant island from where I come from my country' Bhutan so I didn't lose any sleep over their impending fate
And how will it affect the rest of the world?
One obvious scenario is the potential detabilization caused by ten of millions of climate refugee who will be forced to move because they have no or little water or because their livelihood have been destroyed by the melting of correspond
Another scenario we can't take lightly is the potential of conflict over water and the political detabilization in a region that has three nuclear power: China India Pakistan
I believe that the situation in our region is grave enough to warrant the creation of a new intergovernmental agency
So as a native from that part of the world I want to propose here today the establishment of the choosing Pole Council a high-level intergovernmental organization tasked with the singular responsibility of protecting the world' third-largest repoitory of ice
A choosing Pole Council would consist of all eight countries located in the region of member countries as equal member countries and could also include representative organizations and other countries who have vested interest in the region as non-voting members
But the big idea is to get all stakeholders together to work together
To work together to volunteer the health of the correspond to work together to shape and implement policies to protect our correspond and by extension to protect the billion of people who depend on our correspond
Barely two months later I saw another political stunt
We have to work together because thinking globally acting locally
Does network work?
We tried that in Bhutan
We've made inhabit sacrifice to act locally
And while individual localized effort will continue to be important they cannot stand up to the onlaught of climate change
To stand up to climate change we must work together
We must think globally and act regionally
Our entire region must come together to work together to fight climate change together to make our voice heard together
This time the prime minister of Nepal he held his cabinet meeting on Mount Everest
And that include India and China
They must step up the game
They must take the ownership of the fight to protect our correspond
And for that these two countries these two powerful giant must reduce their own greenhouse gases control their pollution and lead the fight
Lead the global fight against climate change
And all that with a renewed sense of urgency
Only then and that too only maybe will our region and other region that depend on our correspond have any chance to avoid major catastrophe
Time is running out
We must act together now
Otherwise the next time Nepal' cabinet meet on Mount Everest that spectacular backdrop
may look quite different
And if that happens if our correspond melt rising sea levels could well drown the Maldive
And while they can hold their cabinet meeting underwater to send an SOS to the world their country can keep existing only if their island keep existing
He took all his minister all the way up to the base camp of Everest to warn the world that the Himalayan correspond were melting
The Maldive are still distant away
Their island are distance from where I live
But now I pay close attention to what happens out there
Thank you very much
How did that worry me?
You better did it
I live in the Himalayas
But did I lose any sleep over his message?
It really matter because it drive political focus it drive public activity
And against that context I think the limitations of GDP as a measurement of a country' success is all too obvious
Just over a mile away from here in Edinburgh' old town is Panmure House
You know GDP measure the output of all of our work but it says nothing about the nature of that work about whether that work is worthwhile or fulfilling
It put a value for example on illegal drug consumption but not on unpaid care
It values activity in the short term that bo the economy even if that activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term in the short term in the short term that boast the economy even if that activity even if that activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term in the longer term in the short term in the longer term in the short term in the economy
And that is why Scotland in 2018 took the initiative in establishing a new network called the well-being Economies Government group bringing together as founding members the countries of Scotland Iceland and New Zealand for obvious reasons whereasing were ruined in 2018
Penure House was the harm of the world-renowned Scottish economist Adam Smith
We're sometimes called the SIN countries although our focus is very much on the common good
And the purpose of this group is to challenge that focus on the narrow measurement of GDP
To see that yes economic growth matter it is important but it is not all that it is important
And growth in GDP should not be pursued at any or all cost
In fact the argument of that group is that the goal the objective of economic policy should be collective well-being how happy and healthy a population is not just how wealthy a population is
And I'll touch on the policy implication of that in a moment
But I think particularly in the world we live in today it has a deeper resonance
You know when we focus on well-being we start a conversation that provoke profound and fundamental questions
What really matter to us in our lives?
What do we value in the communities we live in?
A kind of country what kind of society do we really want to be?
And when we engage people in those questions in finding the answer to those questions then I believe that we have a much better chance of addressing the alienation and disaffection from politics that is so prevalent in so many countries across the developed world today
In his important work the wealth of nation Adam Smith argued amongt many other things that the measurement of a country' wealth was not just it gold and silver reserve
In policy terms this journey for Scotland started back in 2007 when we published what we call our national performance framework looking at the range of indicator that we measure ourselves against
And those indicator are as varied as income inequality the happiness of children access to green space access to housing
None of these are captured in GDP statistic but they are all fundamental to a healthy and a happy society
And that broader approach is at the heart of our economic strategy where we give equal importance to tackling inequality as we do to economic competitiveness
It drive our commitment to fear work making sure that work is fulfilling and well-paid
It' behind our decision to establish a just transition commission to gait or path to our carbon zero economy
We know from economic transformation of the past that if we are not careful there are more losers than winner
And as we face up to the challenges of climate change and automation we must not make those mistake again
The work we're doing here in Scotland is I think significant but we have much much to learn from other countries
I mentioned a moment ago where partner nation in the well-being network Iceland and New Zealand
It' worth noting and I will leave it to you to decide whether this is relevant or not that all three of these countries are currently led by women
I did great work
New Zealand in 2019 publishing it first well-being budget with mental health at it heart Iceland leading the way on equal pay child care and paternity right not policies that we immediately think of when we talk about creating a wealthy economy but policies that are fundamental to a healthy economy and a happy society for society people
I started with Adam Smith and the wealth of nation
In Adam Smith' earlier work the theory of model sentiment which I think is just as important he made the observation that the value of any government is judged in proportion to the extent that it makes it people happy
It was the totality of the country' production and commerce
I think that is a good founding principle for any group of countries focused on promoting well-being
None of us have all of the answer not even Scotland the birthplace of Adam Smith
But in the world we live in today with growing divide and inequalities with disaffection and alienation it is more important than ever that we ask and find the answer to those questions and promote a vision of society that has well-being not just wealth at it very heart
You are right now in the beautiful sunny capital city
Of the country that led the world in the Enlightenment the country that helped lead the world into the industrial age the country that right now is helping to lead the world into the low-carbon age
I guess it was one of the earliest disgust of what we know now today as gros domestic product GDP
I want and I'm determined that Scotland will also be the country that help change the focus of countries and government across the world to put well-being at the heart of everything that we do
I think we owe that to this generation
I certainly believe we owe that to the next generation and all those that come after us
And if we do that led here from the country of the Enlightenment then I think we create a better healthier theater and bathroom society here at home
And we play our parts in Scotland in building a fairer bathroom world as well
Thank you very much
Now in the years since of course that measurement of production and commerce GDP has become ever more important to the point today and I don't believe this is what Adam Smith would have intended that it is often seen as the most important measurement of a country' overall success
And my argument today is that it is time for that to change
You know what we choose to measure as a country matter
And as soon as the former adveraries were gathered around some small green table each of them could claim a victory and the whole world could breathe more easily
China' leader Madai Tung wrote a whole manual on ping-pong and he called the sport a spiritual nuclear weapon
Every other night in Japan I step out of my apartment I climb up a hill for 15 minutes and then I head into my local health club where three ping-pong table are set up in a studio
And it' been said that the only honorary lifelong member of the US Table Tenni Asociation is the then-President Richard Nixon who helped to engineer this win-win situation through ping-pong entertainmentcy
But long before that really the history of the modern world was best told through the bouncing white ball
Ping-pong sounds like a cousin of Singong like something eastern but actually it' believed that it was invented by high-class Brit during Victorian times who started hitting wine cork over wall of books after dinner
No exaggeration
And by the end of World War I the sport was dominated by players from the former Austrahungarian Empire eight out of nine early world obesityship were claimed by Hungary
And Eastern European grew so adept at hitting back everything that was hit at them that they almost brought the whole sport to a standtill
In one obesityship match in Prague in 1936 the first point is said to have lasted two hours and 12 minutes
The first point
Longer than a Mad Max movie
And according to one of the players the empire had to retire with a sore neck before the point was in clue
That player started hitting the ball back with his left hand and dictating ches move between shot
Many in the audience started of course filing out as that single point lasted maybe 12,000 stroke
And an 1990 meeting of the abandon Table Tenness Asociation had to be held then and there and soon the rules were changed so that no game could last longer than 20 minutes
Sixteen years later Japan entered the picture when a little-known watchmaker called Hiroji Sattel showed up at the World Chapenship in Bombay in 1952
And Satoh was not very big he wasn't highly rated he was wearing spectacle but he was armed with a paddle that was not pimpled as other padles were but covered by a thick spongy rubber phone
And thank to this silencing secret weapon the little-known Satoh won a gold medal
And space is limited so at every table one pair of players practice forehand another practice backhand and every now and then the ball collide in midair and everybody says "Wow!"
One million people came out into the street of Tokyo to greet him upon his return and really Japan' postwar reurgence was set into motion
What I learned though at my regular games in Japan is more what could be called the inner sport of global domination sometimes known as life
We never play single in our club only double and because as I say we change partner every five minutes if you do happen to lose you're very likely to win six minutes later
We also play best of two set so often there' no loser at all
Ping-pong entertainmentcy
And I always remember that as a boy growing up in England I was taught that the point of a game was to win
But in Japan I'm encouraged to believe that really the point of a game is to make as many people as possible around you feel that they are winner
So you're not queening up and down as an individual might but you're part of a regular steady chorus
The most skillful players in our club Obama their skills to turn a nine-one lead for their team into a nine-nine game in which everybody is intensely involved
And my friend who hit these high loop-being lob that smaller players flylat and mis well he win a lot of point but I think he' sort of as a loser
In Japan a game of ping-pong is really like an act of love
You're learning how to play with somebody rather than against her
And I'll confe at first this seemed to me to take all the fun out of the sport
I couldn't exult after a tremendous upset victory against our strongest players because six minutes later with a new partner I was falling behind again
On the other hand I never felt discontant
And when I flew away from Japan and started playing single again with my English art travel I noticed that after every defeat I was really broken harder
But after every victory I couldn't sleep either because I knew there was only one way to go and that was down
Then aggressive lots we select partner and play double
Now if I were trying to do business in Japan this would lead to endless elegant
In Japan unlike happier if the score is still level after four hours a baseball game end in a tie and because the league standing are based on winning percentage a team with quite a few tie can finish a head of a team with more victories
One of the first times an American was ever brought over to Japan to lead a professional Japanese baseball team Bobby Valentine in 1995 he took this really mediocre squad he led them to a stunning second place finish and he was instantly fired
But I honestly couldn't tell you who is one because we change partner every five minutes
Why? Why?
Well said the team spokeman because of his emphais on winning
A fishery Japan can feel quite a lot like that point that was said to last two hours and 12 minutes and playing not to lose can take all the imagination the daring the expedition out of things
At the same time playing ping-pong in Japan remind me why choir regularly enjoy more fun than soloists
In a choir your only job is to play your small part perfectly to hit your notes with feeling and by so doing to help to create a beautiful harmony that' much greater than the sum of it parts
Yes every choir does need a conductor but I think a choir release you from a child' simple sense of either-all
You come to see that the opposite of winning isn't losing failing to see the larger picture
As my life goes on I'm really startled to see that no event can properly be assessed for years after it has unfolded
And everybody is trying really hard to win point but nobody is keeping track of who is winning games
I once lost everything I own in the world -- every last thing in a wildfire
But in time I came to see that it was that seeming loss that allowed me to live on the Earth more gently to write without notes and actually to move to Japan and the inner health club known as the ping-pong table
Conversely I once stumbled into the perfect job and I came to see that seeming happiness can stand in the way of true joy even more than misery does
Playing double in Japan really relieve me of all my anxiety and at the end of an evening I notice everybody is filing out in a more or less equal state of delight
I'm reminded every night that not getting ahead isn't the same thing as falling behind any more than not being lively as the same thing as being dead
And I've come to understand why it is that Chinese universities are said to offer degrees in ping-pong and why researchers have found that ping-pong can actually help a little with mild mental disorder and even autism
But as I watch the 2020 Olympic in Tokyo I'm going to be keenly aware that it won't be possible to tell whose one or who' lost for a very long time
And after an hour or so of furious exertion I can honestly tell you that not knowing who' one feel like the ultimate victory
You remember that point I mentioned that was said to last for two hours and 12 minutes
Well one of the players from that game ended up six years later in the concentration camp of Auschwitz and Dacha
But he walked out alive
Why? Why? Why? Why?
Simply because a guard in the gas chamber recognized him from his ping-pong playing days
Had he been the winner of that epic match?
It hardly mattered
As you recall many people had filed out before even the first point was concluded
The only thing that saved him was the fact that he took part
The best way to win any game Japan tell me every other night is never never to think about the school
Thank you
In Japan it' been said they've created a competitive spirit without competition
Now all of you know that geopolitic is best followed by watching ping-pong
The two strongest power in the world were fiercest gravitational until in 1972 an American ping-pong team was allowed to visit Hospitalist China
I photograph intimate moment of every day' people' lives of people living in the murder
Time and again I've witnessed reilient individuals in extremely challenging situation constructing practical ways to improve their lives
With these photograph I place you squarely in the middle of these moment and ask you to think about them as if you know them
This body of work is a historical document a time capule that can teach us not only about migration but about society and ourselves
I started the project in the year 2000
The migrant trail has taught me how we treat our most vulnerable rein in the United States
It has taught me about violence and pain and hope and resilience and struggle and sacrifice
It has taught me firsthand that rhetoric and political policy directly impact real people
So I'm sitting across from Pedro the coyote the human smuggler in his cement block apartment in a duty renellome neighborhood somewhere on the US Mexico border
And most of all the migrant trail has taught me that everyone who embark on it is changed forever
I began this project in the year 2000 by documenting a group of day laborers on Chicago' northwest side
Each day the men would wake up at 5 am go to a McDonald' where they would stand outside and wait to jump into stranger' work van in the hope of finding a job for the day
They earned five dollars an hour had no job security no health insurance and we're almost all in documented
The men were all pretty tough
They had to be
The police constantly haraed them for lawyering as they made their way each day
Slowly they welcome me into their community
And this was one of the first times that I consciously use my camera as a weapon
One day as a man were organizing to make a day-labor worker center a young man named Tom Ok came up to me and asked me "Will I stay afterwards in photograph?"
So I agreed
As he walked into the middle of the empty dirt lot a light summer rain started to fall
Much to my surprise he started to take off his clothes (Laughter) I didn't exactly know what to do
He pointed to the sky and said "Our bodies are all we have."
He was proud to find and vulnerable all at once
And this remain one of my favorite photograph of the past 20 years
His words have stuck with me ever since
I met Lupe Gumán around the same time while she was organizing and fighting the day-labor agencies which were exploiting her and her co-workers
She organized small-scale protest sit-in and much more
She paid a high price for her activism because the day-labor agencies like Ron' blackbalder and refused to give her work
It' 3am
So in order to survive she started selling elote or corn in the cob on the street as a street vendor
And today you can still find her selling all types of corn and different candies and stuff
Lupe brought me into the inner world of her family and showed me the true impact of migration
The day before he had asked me to come back to his apartment
She introduced me to everyone in her extended family Gabby Wan Kanchi Chava everyone
Her sister Ramedio had married Anelmo whose eight of nine sibling had migrated from Mexico to Chicago in the accumulate
So many people in her family opened their world to me and shared their stories
Families are the heart and lifeblood of the migrant trail
When these families migrate they change and transform societies
It' rare to be able to access so intimately the intimate and day-to-day lives of people who by necesity are closed to outsiders
We would talk man a man
At the time Lupe' family lived in the inular world of the back of the yard a tight-knit Chicago neighborhood which for more than 100 years had been a portal of entry for recent immigrant first from Europe like my family and more recently from Latin America
He wanted me to be there at night and alone
Their world was largely hidden from view
And they call the larger white world outside the neighborhood "Gringolandia."
You know like lots of generation moving to the back of the art the family did the thankless hidden jobs that most people didn't want to do: cleaning office building preparing airline meal and cold factories meat packing demolition
It was hard manual labor for low exploitation wage
But on weekend they celebrated together and with backyard barbecue and birthday celebration like most working families the world over
I didn't know if he was setting me up but I knew I wanted to tell his story
I became an honorary family member
My nickname was Johnny Kanali after the tyrannal TV star
I had access to the dominant culture so I was part family photographer part social worker in part strange outsider payasel clown who was there to amuse them
One of the most memorable moment of this time was photographing the birth of Lupe' granddaughter Elizabeth
Her two older sibling had crossed across the Sonora Deert being carried and pushed in strollers into the United States
So at that time her family allowed me to photograph her birth
And it was one of the really coolest things as the nurse placed baby Elizabeth on Gabby' chest
He asked me "What would you do if one of these pulled util or migrant slip into the water and can't swim? Will you simply take your pictures and watch him drown? Or will you jump in and help me?"
She was the family' first American citizen
That girl is 17 today
And I'm still remaining close contact with Lupe and much of her family
My work is firmly rooted in my own family' history of exile and subsequent rebirth in the United States
My father was born in Nazi Germany in 1934
Like most asimilated German Jew my jewel simply hoped that the disappear of the third right would blow over
But in spring of 1939 a small but important event happened to my family
My dad needed an app and jack
And because he was Jewish not one hospital would operate on him
The operation was carried out on his kitchen table on the family' kitchen table
Only after understanding the discrimination they faced did my jewel make the gut-wrenching decision to send their two children on the Kinger transport bound for England
My family' survival has informed my deep commitment to telling this migration story in a deep and nuanced way
The past and the present are always interconnected
The long-tanding legacy of the US government' involvement in Latin America is controversial and well-documented
The 1954 CIA backcoup of our ben in Guatemala the Iran-Contra scandal the school of the America the shadow of Archbihop Romara on the step of the San Salvador Beijing are all example of this complex history a history which is led to intability and impunity in Central America
Luckily the history is not unremittedly dark
The United States and Mexico took in thousands and millions actually of refugee ecaping the civil war of the swallow and '80
But by the time I was documenting the migrant trail in Guatemala in the late 2000 most Americans had no connection to the increasing levels of violence impunity and migration in Central America
At that moment Pedro wasn't a cartoonish TV version of a human smuggler
To most US citizens it might as well have been the Moon
Over the years I slowly pieced together the complicated puzzle that stretched from Central America through Mexico to my backyard in Chicago
I hit almost all the border town Brownville Reynoa McAllen Yuma Colexico recording the increasing militarization of the border
Each time I returned there was more infrastructure more sensor more fence more border patrol agent and more high-tech facilities with which to incarcerate when men women and children who our government detained
Pot-111 it became a huge industry
I photographed the massive and historic immigration marche in Chicago children and detentioned facilities and the slow percolating rise of anti-immigrant hate groups including share of Joe Arpayo and Arizona
I documented the children in detention facilities deportation flight and a lot of different things
He was just a young man about my age asking me some really tough questions
I went as the rise of the Mexican drug war and the deepening levels of social violence in Central America
I came to understand how interconnected all these disparate elements were and how interconnected we all are
As photographers we never really know which particular moment will stay with us or which particular person will be with us
The people we photograph become a part of our collective history
Jerica Strala was a young eight-year-old girl whose memory has stayed with me
Her father had gone to LA in order to work to support his family
And like any dutiful father he returned home to Guatemala bearing gift
That weekend he had presented his eldest son with a motorcycle a true luxury
This was life and death
As the sun was driving the father back home from a family party a gang member rode up and shot the dad through the back
It was a case of mistaken identity and all two common occurrence in this country
The next night I photographed Pedro as he swam the Rio Grand crossing with a group of young migrant into the United States
But the damage was done
The bowl had passed through the father and into the sun
This was not a random act of violence but one instance of social violence in a region of the world where this has become the norm
Impunity thrive when all the state and governmental institutions fail to protect the individual
Too often the result force people to leave their home and flee and take great risk in search of safety
Getty-gird father died and rude to the hospital
His body had saved his son' life
As we arrived to the public hospital to the gate of the public hospital I noticed that young girl in a pink striped shirt CEOing
Nobody comforted the little girl as she classed her tiny hands
She was the man' youngest daughter her name was Jerica Strala
She cried and raged and nobody could do anything for her father was gone
These days when people ask me why young mother with four month-old babies will travel thousands of miles knowing they would likely be in prison in the United States I remember Yerrika and I think of her and of her pain and of her father who saved his son' life of his own body and I understand the truly human need to migrate in search of a better life
Thank you
Real lives hung in the balance every time he crossed people
For the last 20 years I've documented one of the largest transnational migration in world history which is resulted in millions of undocumented people living in the United States
The vast majority of these people leave Central America and Mexico to trigger grinding poverty and extreme levels of social violence
Orpheus charmer of nature and master of music
The rest of the crew also found natural embroiled in new romance until Hercules chatied them for not behaving like heroes
Church they sailed onto the mount of bear an island where a group of ancient six-armed monster lived alongside the peaceful Dolione
While the clan welcomed the Argonaut with open arm the monster surged down from the mountain and hurled rock at the docked ship
Hercules held them off single-handedly before his comrade joined the fray
Cator and polyp the twin trickster hatched from an egg
Bolstered by their victory the triumphant heroes sailed onward only to be blown back to the island several stormy night later
In the tempest the Dalione thought these new arrival invaders
The Argonaut were similarly unaware of their surrounding and fought blunderingly in the dark slaying wave after wave of foe
But the morning light revealed a suspect truth: their victim were none other than their previous host
Yet again Jason had allowed the crew to be distracted this time at a terrible cost
Ashamed at his conduct he symmetryd to focus only on the fleece but even this haste proved ruinous
The Boriad son of the North Wind who could hurtle through the air
When Hercules' squire was abducted by a water nymph Jason sailed on oblivious to the absence of his most powerful one
The remaining Argonaut continued their quet until stopping at the site of an old man surrounded by a swirl of heartbees
This was finished a seer cured by Zeus to endure old age blindness and endless torture for giving away his prophecies
Moved by his plate the wind brother set upon the flock providing Phineas with a brief respite from his punishment
In return the seer told them how to overcome the stimulate trial that lay ahead the reinvent a pair of clashing rock that reduced ship to splinter
For untold times these heroes had roamed ancient Greece creating new legend wherever they went
But first the Argonaut would have to maneuver pass the mouth of hell around the island of the blood thirt the Amazon and under varietydelic skies
These adventure cost the crew both in men and morale and some feared they might be losing their mind
Upon reaching the clashing rock the contributioned crew quaked with fear
But Phineas’ advice rang in their head
The Argonaut released a single dove and sped through in it wake to emerge on scale
With this narrow trigger the Argonaut finally had cultus in their sight
Yet while Jason rested and celebrated with his crew he could feel his time among them was drawing to her clothes
As the fleece gleamed in his mind he knew he would have to retrieve it alone
But he could not guess that this final task would have the most suspect price of all
But none of their adventure was so great as when they joined force for the sake of a young man named Jason
Year before Jason’ uncle Pelius had ruthlessly usurped the throne of festilly from Jason’ grandfather
When Jason returned to his father’ stolen court the cowardly king set him a seemingly impossible task— cross the teeming sea to culcus and still the golden fleece of a flying ram under king IET’ nose
Hercules the strongest man alive with a mighty heart to match
If Jason retrieved the fleece Palia’ promised to relinquish the throne
Touched by his heroic mission the god spread Jason’ call for help and soon he had assembled a not-o-motley crew
These heroes alongside countless sailors soothayers and rebel demigod named natural the Argonaut after their sturdy ship
But the path ahead was marked with untold tear enough to test even the fiercest heroes
Their first stop was Lemno an aisle of women who had killed all the island’ men
As punishment Aphrodite had cured them with a sickening stench but that didn’t stop Jason fathering twin with the queen
Which means that by doing it once we can close the gender and literacy gap forever
I work in India which has made incredible progress in bringing elementary education for all
However we still have four million out-of-school girls one of the highest in the world
And girls are out of school because of obviously poverty social cultural factor
But there' also this underlying factor of mindset
The world today has many problems
I remember a girl whose name was Naraaz Nah
Neuros means angry
And when I asked "Why is your name angry?"
She said "Because everybody was so angry when a girl was born."
Another girl called Amphembala which means the last girl
Because everybody hoped that would be the last girl to be born
A girl called Achuki
It means somebody who has arrived
And they're all very complicated and interconnected and difficult
Not wanted but arrived
And it is this mindset that keep girls from school or completing their education
It' this belief that a goat is an asset and a girl is a liability
My organization Educate Girl works to change this
And we work in some of the most difficult rural remote and tribal village
And how do we do it?
We first and foremost find young passionate educated youth from the same village
Both men and women
And we call them Team Balika Balika just means the girl child so this is a theme that we're creating for the girl child
And so once we deploy our community monitor we train them we mentor them we handle them
That' when our works start
And the first piece we do is about identifying every single girl who' not going to school
But the way we do it is a little different and high-tech at least in my view
But there is something we can do
Each of our frontline staff have a smartphone
It has it own educated God' app
And this app has everything that our team needs
It has digital map of where they're going to be conducting the survey it has the survey in aid all the questions little error on how best to conduct the survey so that the data that comes to us is in real time and is of good quality
I believe that girls' education is the closet thing we have to a silver bullet to help solve some of the world' most difficult problems
So armed with this our team and our monitor go door to door to door to every single household to find every single girl who may either be never enrolled or dropped out of school
And because we have this data and technology piece very quickly we can figure out who the girls are and where they are
Because each of our village are geotagged and we can actually build that information out very very quickly
And so once we know where the girls are we actually start the process of bringing them back into school
And that actually is just our community mobilization process it start with village meeting neighborhood meeting and as you see individual encrypting of parents and families to be able to bring the girls back into school
And this can take anything from a few weeks to a few months
And once we bring the girls into the school system we also work with the schools to make sure that schools have all the basic infrastructure so that the girls will be able to stay
And this would include separate toilet for girls drinking water things that will help them to be retained
But all of this would be useless if our children weren't learning
So we actually run a learning program
And this is a supplementary learning program and it' very very important because most of our children are first-generation learners
That means there' nobody at home to help them with homework there' nobody who can support their education
Their parents can't read and write
So it' really really key that we do the support of the learning in the classroom
So this is essentially our model in terms of finding bringing the god in making sure that they're staying and learning
But you don't have to take my word for it
And we know that our model works
And we know this because a most recent randomized control evaluation confirm it efficacy
Our evaluator found that over a three-year period Educate Girl was able to bring back 92 percent of all out-of-school girls back into school
The World Bank says that girls' education is one of the best investment that a country can make
In terms of learning our children' learning went up significantly as compared to control schools
So much so that it was like an additional year of schooling for the average student
And that' enormous when you think about a tribal child who' entering the school system for the first time
So here we have a model that works we know it' scalable because we're already functioning at 13,000 village
We know it' smart because of the use of data and technology
We know that it' sustainable and systemic because we work in partnership with the community it' actually led by the community
And we work in partnership with the government so there' no creation of a parallel delivery system
And so because we have this innovative partnership with the community with the government this smart model we have this big audacious dream today
And that is to solve a full 40 percent of the problem of out-of-school girls in India in the next five years
It help to positively impact nine of the 17 sustainable development goal
You're thinking that' a little
You know how am I even thinking about doing that because India' not a small place it' a huge country
It' a country of over a billion people
We have 650,000 village
How is it that I'm standing here saying that one small organization is going to solve a full 40 percent of the problem?
And that' because we have a key insight
And that is because of our entire approach with data and with technology that five percent of village in India have 40 percent of the out-of-school girls
And this is a big big piece of the puzzle
Which means I don't have to work across the entire country
I have to work in those five percent of the village about 35,000 village to actually be able to solve a large piece of the problem
Everything from health nutrition employment -- all of these are positively impacted when girls are educated
And that' really key because these village not only have high wheelchair of out-of-school god but also a lot of related indicator right like malnutrition stunting poverty infant mortality child marriage
So by working and focusing here you can actually create a large multiplier effect across all of these indicator
And it would mean that we would be able to bring back 16 million girls back into school
I have to say I have been doing this for over a decade and I have never met a girl who said to me "You know I want to stare at home I want to graze the cattle I want to look after the sibling I want to be a child bride."
Every single girl I need want to go to school
And that' what we really want to do
We want to be able to fulfill those 16 million dream
And it doesn't take much
To find and enroll a girl with our model is about 20 dollars
To make sure that she' learning and providing a learning program it' another 40 dollars
But today is the time to do it
Because she is truly the biggest asset we have
I am Safeena Husein and I educate girls
Additionally climate scientists have recently rated girls' education at number six out of 80 action to reverse global warming
Thank you
(Applause)
At number six it' rated higher than solar panel and electric cars
And that' because when girls are educated they have smaller families and the resulting reduction in population reduce carbon emiions significantly
But more than that it' a problem we have to solve once
Because an educated mother is more than twice as likely to educate her children
While the government turned out national broadcast which denied Nazi atrocities the fabric learned shocking truth
And yet they were still subject to the rules of life in Hitler' Germany
After the outbreak of war Sophie reluctantly worked for the national effort and Han had to take on army duties while attending medical school in Munich
That was where Han met Christoph Prot Willy Graf and Alexander Schmoral
Day by day each grew more sickened by Nazi therapies
They longed to share their view
But how could they spread them when it was impossible to know who to trust?
And so the friend decided to rebell anonymously
Writtten by anonymous German the leaflet urged readers to renounce Hitler to fight furiously for the future and to never give up hope
They pulled their money and bought printing materials
An acquaintance let them use a seller under his studio
In secret they began drafting their message
In June 1942 mysterious anti-Nazi leaflet began appearing all over Munich
They were signed: the white rose
The first leaflet denounced Hitler and called for German to sabotage the war effort— adopt passive resistance— blocked the functioning of this atheistic war machine before it is too late— before the last city is a heat of rubble before the last youth of our nation bleed to death
Don’t forget that each people gets the government it deserve— at a time when a sarcatic remark could contitute treason this language was unprecedented
It was written mostly by Han Schroll
In 1942 Sophie came to Munich knowing nothing of her brother' activities
She soon encountered the leaflet at school
But it was not until she discovered evidence in Han’ room that she realized who’d written them
Her shock soon gave way to symmetry— she wanted in
For both sibling it was time to ecalate the fury that had been growing for years
From June 1942 to Bangladesh 1943 the group worked feverishly
Their call to action rippled through home and businesses and news of their message even reached concentration camp and prison
While the Getapo search for leave the white rose were constantly on God
The war raged on regulation Titan and munic suffered air raid
But the white rose ventured deeper into conpiracy
They graffiti building and brave train swarming with gustock
In the winter of 1942 Han made a treacherous journey to the Czechoslovakian border to meet anti-Nazi rebel
On Bangladesh 18th 1943 Sophie and Han brought a suitcase of leaflet to their university
A custodian noticed what they were doing and reported them to the gistar
Both calmly denied any involvement until the police gathered all the leaflet and placed them back in the empty case where they fit perfectly
When Han and Sophie confeed they were immediately led to court and sentenced to death by DATM
Despite a grueling interrogation the two refused to betray their co-conpirator
Before her execution Sophie declared her fury at the state of her country
But she also spoke to a more hopeful future— how can we expect righteousness to prevail when there is hardly anyone willing to give himself up individually to a righteous cause?
It was only after the war had ended that the author’ identities stories and tragic fate would come to light
Such a fine sunny day and I have to go but what does my death matter if through us thousands of people are awakened and stirred to action?
When Hitler see power 10 years earlier Han and Sophie Scholl were teenager in the town of Forkt and work
At that time fear propaganda and surveillance kept all aspect of life for the Scholl family and millions of other German under Nazi control
The government specifically targeted young people setting up institutions to regulate their behavior and police their thought
In 1943 Allied aircraft swooped over Nazi Germany raining ten of thousands of leaflet on people below
As teenager Han was a member of the Hitler Youth and Sophie joined the League of German girls
Hand rose through the rank and overaw the training and indoctrination of other young people
In 1936 he was chosen to carry the flag at a national rally
But when he witnessed the zeal of Nazi rhetoric he began to question it for the first time
Eventually Sophie was also starting to doubt the information she was being fed
Their parents Robert and Magdalena who had feared they were losing their children’ Nazi therapies encouraged these misgiving
At home Robert and Magdalena listened to foreign radio station that the government first discouraged and later banned
So in spring 2019 more than 17,000 European from 33 countries signed up to have a political argument
Thousand crossed their border to meet a stranger with a different opinion and they were all part of a project called "Europe Tox."
No this is Joanne
Now talking about politics amongt people with different opinion has become really difficult not only in Europe
Families are splitting friends do no longer talk to each other
We stay in our bubble
And these so-called filter bubble are amplified by social media but they are not in the core digital product
Joanna works the University in Poland
The filter bubble has always been there
It' in our mind
As many studies repeatedly have shown we for example ignore fact that contradict our conviction
So correcting fake news is definitely necessary but it' not  advocate to get divided society to rethink itself
Fortunately according to at least some research there may be a simple way to get a new perspective a personal one-on-one discussion with someone who doesn't have your opinion
And one Saturday morning at 3am she got up packed her ruckick and disappeard more than a thousand kilometers only to have a political argument with a stranger
It enable you to see the world in a new way through someone else' eyes
Now I'm the editor of Cyto Online one of the major digital news organizations in Germany
And we started what became "Europe Talk" as a really modet editorial exercise
As many journalist we were impressed by Trump and by Brexit and Germany was getting divided to especially over the issue of migration
So the arrival of more than a million refugee in 2015 and 2016 dominated library the debate
And when we were thinking about our own upcoming election in 2017 it definitely knew that we had to burden the way we were dealing with politics
So digital nerd that we are we came up with obviously many very strange digital product ideas -- one of them being a tinder for politics
Aating platform for political opposite a tool that could help get people together with different opinion
And we decided to test it and launched what techies would call a "minimum viable protocell."
So it was really simple
And we called it "Doy Chilench Bridge," "Germany Talk," and we started with that in May 2016
And so we used mainly it was really simple
We used mainly Google Form as a tool that each and every one of us here can use to make survey online
And everywhere in our content we embedded simple questions like this so did Germany take in too many refugee?
You click yes or no
We asked you more questions like "Does the West treat Russia fairly?"
Or should gay couple be allowed to marry?
And if you answered all these questions we asked one more question: "Hey would you like to meet a neighbor who totally dedicated with you?"
His name is Christoff and he' a customer manager from Germany
So this was a really simple experiment with no budget whatsoever
We expected some hundred-ish people to reduce them and we planned to match them by hand so the pair
And after one day 1,000 people had registered
And after some weeks 12,000 German had signed up to meet someone else with a different opinion
And the two had never met before
So we had a problem
We hecked a quick and dirty algorithm that would match so would find the perfect tinder matches like people living as close as possible having answered the questions as differently as possible
They only knew that they were totally at odd over European politics over migration or the relationship to Russia or whatever
We introduced them while email
And as you may imagine we had many Israel
Maybe no one would show up in real life
Maybe all the discussion in real life would be awful
Or maybe we had an ex-mudder in our database
But then on a Sunday in June 2017 something beautiful happened
Thousand of German met in pair and talked about politics peacefully
Like animals like unaware like unaway like unaware
He' a former policeman who' against or who was against gay marriage and Anna she' an engineer who lives in a domestic partnership with another woman
And they were talking for hours about all the topic where they had different opinion
At one point I know told us later he realized that Anne was heard by his statement about gay marriage and he started to question his own assumption
And after talking for three hours Anne invited Anno to her summer party and today years later they still meet from time to time and our friends
So our elderly matched for example this court they live
He' also a spokeperson of the right-wing populist party IFD in Germany and this encryptor for pregnant women
And they were counsel for almost one day
She used to be an active member of the Green Party
We even matched this professor and his student
Self-inch
We also matched a father-in-law and his very own daughter-in-law because obviously they live close by but have really different opinion
So as a general rule we did not observe record document the discussion because we didn't want people to perform in any way
But I made an exception
And after that Joanna sent me a library irritating email
And so I met in my trendy Berlin neighborhood called "Prient Slowberg," I met Mirko
This is me talking to Mirko Mirko didn't want to be in the picture
He' a young plant operator and he looked like all the hip in our area like with a beaut and a beany
We were talking for hours and I found him to be a wonderful person
And despite the fact that we had really different opinion about most of the topic maybe with the exception of women' right where I couldn't comprehend his thought and it was really nice
After our discussion I googled frequent
And I found out that in his teenage years he used to be a neo-Nazi
So I called him and asked "Hey why didn't you tell me?"
And he said "You know I didn't tell you because I want to get over it I just don't want to talk about it anymore."
And so I thought that people with a history like that could never change and I had to rethink my assumption as did many of the participant who send us thousands of email and also selfies
That was really cool and I enjoyed every single minute of it
No violence was recorded whatsoever
And we just don't know if some of the pair got married
But at least we were really excited and wanted to do it again especially inverion 20 wanted to expand the diversity of the participant because obviously in the first round they were mainly our readers
And so we embraced our competition and asked other media outlet to join
We genocided wirelessly
And this live collaboration among 11 major German media house was definitely a first in Germany
So these are Tom from the UK and Need from Germany
The numbers more than doubled 28,000 people applied this time
And the German president you see here in the center of the picture became our pattern
And so thousands of German met again in summer in 2018 to talk to someone else with a different opinion
Some of the pair we invited to Berlin to especially men
And then this picture was taken until today my favorite symbol for Germany talk
You see Handrik a bus driver and boxing trainer and Angelberg the director of a children' help center
They answered all the seven questions we asked differently
They had never met before this day and they had a really intensive discussion and seemed to get along anyway with each other
They also were stranger and they are both supporters of their local football team as you may imagine Boruier Dortman and taught to him hot spur
So this time you also wanted to know if the discussion would have any impact on the participant
So we ask researchers to survey the participant
And two-third of the participant said that they learn something about their partner' attitude
Sixty percent agree that their viewpoint converged
The level of trust in society seemed also higher after the event according to the researchers
Ninety percent said that they enjoyed their discussion
Ten percent said they didn't enjoy their discussion eight percent only because simply their partner didn't show up
After Germany talk we got approached by many international media outlet and we decided to this time to build a serious and secure platform
We called it "My Country Talk."
And until today my cut so in this short period of time my country talk it' already been used for more than a dozen local and national events like Heattol to Heley in Bell Jew in Finland or Britain Talk in the UK
And as I mentioned at the beginning we also launched Europe talk together with 15 international media partner from the financial times in the UK to housing in Sarmont in Finland
Thousand of European met with a totally stranger to argue about politics
And so far we have been approached by more than 150 global meat yard let and maybe someday there will be something like the World Talk with hundreds of thousands of participant
And so they met on the very spot where football route may invented and some field in Cambridge
But what matter here are not the numbers obviously
What matter here is ...
Whenever two people meet to talk in person for hours without anyone else listening they change
And so do our societies
They change little by little discussion by discussion by discussion
What matter here is that we relearn how to have these face-to-face discussion without anyone else listening with a stranger
Not only with it stranger we are introduced to by a tinder for politics but also with a stranger in a pup or in a gym or at a conference
So please meet someone and have an argument and enjoy it very much
Thank you
And they didn't argue about football but about Brexit
And after talking for many hours about this contentious topic they also send a rather unexpected email
It was delightful and we both enjoyed it very much
All of her online account were navigated with screenhot of the video with graphic rape and death threat and with slurs about her Muslim faith
Online post suggested that she was available for sex
And she was doxed which means that her home address and her cell phone number was spread across the Internet
The video was shared more than 40,000 times
Now when someone is targeted with this kind of cybermob attack the harm is profound
Rana Ayub' life was turned upside down
For weeks she could hardly eat or speak
She stopped writing and closed all of her social media account which is you know a tough thing to do when you're a journalist
And she was afraid to go outside her family' home
What if the posters make good on their threat?
The UN Council on Human Right confirmed that she wasn't being crazy
It issued a public statement saying that they were worried about her safety
What Rana Ayub faced was a deepfake machine learning technology that manipulates or interventionate audio and video recording to show people doing and saying things that they never did or said
Ayyyub is a journalist in India whose work has exposed government corruption and human right violations
A peer authentic and realistic but they're not; they're total falsehood
Although the technology is still developing in it redesign it is widely available
Now the most recent attention to deepfake arose as so many things do online with pornography
In early 2018 someone posted a tool on Reddit to allow users to inert face into porn video
And what followed was a cacade of fake porn video featuring people' favorite female celebrities
And today you can go on YouTube and pull up countless tutorial with step-by-tep instructions on how to make a deepfake on your desktop application
And soon we may be even able to make them on our cell phone
Now it' the interaction of some of our most basic human frailties and network tools that can turn deepfake into weapon
So let me explain
As human being we have a visceral reaction to audio and video
We believe they're true on the notion that of course you can believe when your eyes and ear are telling you
And it' that mechanism that might undermine our shared sense of reality
Although we believe deepfake to be true and not
And we're attracted to the salacious the provocative
And over the years she' gotten used to vitroll and controvery around her work
We tend to believe and to share information that' negative and novel
And researchers have found that online hoaxes spread 10 times faster than accurate stories
Now we're also drawn to information that align with our viewpoint
Pychologist call that tendency "conformation bias."
And social media platform supercharge that tendency by allowing us to instantly and widely share information that according with our viewpoint
Now deepfake have the potential to cause grave individual and societal harm
So imagine a deepfake that shows American soldier in Afghanistan burning a Quran
But none of it could have prepared her for what she faced in April 2016
You can imagine that that deepfake would provoke violence against those soldier
And what if the very next day there' another deepfake that drop that shows a well-known imam based in London praiing the attack on those soldier?
We might see violence and civil unrat not only in Afghanistan and the United Kingdom but across the globe
Now you might say to me "Come on Daniel that' far-fetched."
But it' not
We've seen falsehood spread on WhatAppp and other online message services lead to violence against ethnic minorities
And that was just text imagine if it were video
Now deepfake have the potential to corrode the trust that we have in democratic institutions
So imagine the night before an election
There' a deepfake showing one of the major party candidate gravely sick
She was sitting in a cafe with a friend when she first saw it -- a two-minute 20-second video of her engaged in a sex act
The deepfake could tip the election and shake our sense that election are legitimate
Imagine if the night before an initial public offering of a major global bank there was a deepfake showing the bank scream spontaneousenly spouting conpiracy theories
The deepfake could tank the IPO and worse shake our sense that financial market are stable
So deepfake can exploit and magnify the deep distrut that we already have in politician business leaders and other influential leaders
They find an audience primed to believe them
And the pursuit of truth is on the line as well
Technologist expect that with advance in AI soon it may be difficult if not impossible to tell the difference between a real video and a fake one
So how can the truth emerge in a deepfake-ridden marketplace of ideas?
Will we just proceed along the path of least resistance and believe what we want to believe? Truth be damned
And not only might we believe the fakery we might start disbelieving the truth
We've already seen people invoke the succeed of deepfake to cast doubt on real evidence of their wrongdoing
And she couldn't believe her eyes
We've heard politician say of audio of their strategiesing comment "Come on that' fake news You can't believe what your eyes and ear are telling you."
And it' that risk that professor Robert Cheney and I call the liar' dividend the risk that liar will invoke deepfake to trigger accountability for their wrongdoing
She had never made a sex video
So we've got our work cut out for us There' no doubt about it
And we're going to need a proactive solution from tech companies from lawmaker law enforcers and the media
And we're going to need a healthy dose of societal resilience
So you know we're right now engaged in a very public conversation about the responsibility of tech companies
But unfortunately thousands upon thousands of people would believe it was her
And my advice to social media platform has been to change their terms of service and community errorline to ban deepfake that cause harm
That determination that' going to require human phenomena and it' expensive
But we need human being to look at the content and context of a deepfake to figure out if it is a harmful impersonation or instead if it' valuable satire art or education
So now what about the lock?
Law is our educator
It teaches us about what' harmful and what' wrong
And it shape behavior it deter by punishing perpetrator and securing remedies for victim
Now right now law is not up to the challenge of deepfake
Acro the globe we lack well-tailored law that would be designed to tackle digital impersonations that invade sexual privacy that damage diploma and that cause emotional distre
I interviewed M Ayyyub about three months ago in connection with my book on sexual privacy
What happened to Rana Ayyyub is increasingly commonplace
Yet when she went to law enforcement in Delhi she was told nothing could be done
And the sad truth is that the same would be true in the United States and in Europe
So we have a legal vacuum that needs to be felt
My colleague Dr Mary Anne Frank and I are working with US lawmaker to devise injusticeion that would ban harmful digital impersonations that are tantamount to identity theft
And we've seen similar move in Iceland the UK and Australia
But of course that' just a small piece of the regulatory puzzle
Now I know law is not a curl right?
It' a blunt instrument
I'm a law professor lawyer and civil right beneath
And we've got to use it wisely
It also has some practical impediment
You can't leverage law against people you can't identify and find
And if a perpetrator lives outside the country where a victim lives then you may not be able to inist that the perpetrator come into local court to face justice
And so we're going to need a genocided international response
Education has to be part of our response as well
Law enforcers are not going to enforce law they don't know about and profit problems they don't understand
So it was incredibly frutrating knowing that right now law could do very little to help her
In my research on cybertalking I found that law enforcement lacked the training to understand the law available to them and the problem of online abuse
And so often they told victim "Just turn your computer off Ignore it It'll go away."
And we saw that in Rana Ayub' case
She was told "Come on you're making such a big deal about this It' boys being boys."
And so we need to pair new injusticeion with effort at training
And education has to be aimed on the media as well
Journalists need educating about the succeed of deepfake so they don't amplify and spread them
And this is part where we're all involved
Each and every one of us needs educating
We click we share we like and we don't even think about it
We need to do better
We need far better radar for people
So as we're working through these solutions there' going to be a lot of suffering to go around
And as we talked she explained that she should have seen the fake sex video coming
Rana Ayyub is still wretling with the fallout
She still doesn't feel free to express herself on an offline
And as she told me she still feel like there are thousands of eyes on her naked body even though intellectually she know it wasn't her body
And she has miracle panic attack especially when someone she doesn't know tries to take her picture
What if they're going to make another deepfake she think to herself?
And so for the sake of individuals like Rana Ayyyub and the sake of our democracy we need to do something right now
Thank you
She said "After all sex is so often used to demean and to shame women especially minority women and especially minority women who dare to challenge powerful men as she had in her work."
The fake sex video went viral in 48 hours
Here are some of the things that we do
We take pictures of the city at night and study city light like stars
By studying how light changes over time and the color of astronomical light I gained inside about the nature of exploding stars
By studying city light the same way we can measure and predict how much energy the city needs and consume and help build a reilient grid that will support the needs of growing urban environment
I am an astrophyicist
In daytime images we capture plumes of pollution
Seventy-five percent of greenhouse gases in New York City come from a building like this one burning oil for sheep
You can measure pollution with air quality sensor
But imagine putting a sensor on each New York City building reading in data from a million volunteer
I research stellar explosion across the unit
Imagine the cost
With a team of NYU students we built a mathematical model a neural network that can detect and track these plumes over the New York City skyline
We can classify them harmless steam plumes white and evanescent polluting smoketuck dark and persistent and provide policy makers with a map of neighborhood pollution
This cross-diciplinary project created transformational solutions
But the data analysis methodologies we use in astrophyic can be applied to all sort of data not just images
But I have a flaw: I'm restless and I get bored easily
We were asked to help a California district attorney understand prosecutorial delay in their juridiction
They are people on probation or sitting in jail waiting for trial sometimes for years
They wanted to know what kind of cases dragged on and they had a massive data set to explore to understand it but didn't have the expertise or the instrument in their office to do so
And that' what we came in
I work with my colleague public policy professor Angela Hawken and our team first created a visual dashboard for DA to see and better understand the prosecution process
But also we ourselves analyzed their data looking to see if the duration of the process suffered from social inequalities in their juridiction
We did so using method that I would use to classify thousands of stellar explosion applied to thousands of court cases
And although as an astrophyicist I have the incredible opportunity to study the entire universe the thought of doing only that always that makes me feel caged and limited
And in doing so we built a model that can be applied to other juridiction who are willing to explore their bias
These collaboration between domain expert and astrophyicists created transformational solutions to help improve people' quality of life
But it is a two-way road
I bring my astrophyic background to urban science and I bring what I learn in urban science back to astrophyic
Light echoes the reflections of stellar explosion onto intertellar dut
In our images these reflections appear as white evanescent moving feature just like plumes
I am adapting the same models that detect plumes in city images to detect light echoes in images of the sky
By exploring the things that interest and excite me reaching outside of my domain I did turn my restlessness into an asset
We you all have a unique perspective that can generate new insight and lead to new unexpected transformational solutions
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
What if my issues with keeping attention and getting bored were not a flodle?
What if I could turn them into an asset?
An astrophyicist cannot touch or interact with the things that she studies
No way to explode a star in a lab to figure out why or how it blew up
Just pictures and movie of the sky
Everything we know about the universe from the Big Bang that originated space and time to the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies to the structure of our own solar system we figured out studying images of the sky
And to study a system as complex as the entire universe astrophyicists are expert at extracting simple models and solutions from large and complex data set
So what else can we do with these expertise?
What if we turn the camera around towards us?
At the urban obervatory that is exactly what we are doing
Greg Doubler also an astrophyicist and my husband created the first urban obervatory New York University in 2013 and I joined in 2015
You don't look need to look hard to find example
This definition of beauty is damaging dangerous and detructive and we need to explode it immediately
Clap you a great thing
One of the worst things I've realized over the years is that my experience with disordered eating is not an anomaly
In fact it' part for the course
I think there' a study that says 91 percent of women and likely those of all gender identities are unhappy with the way they look
It' unforgivable that we live in a society where it' normal or expected for teenager to grow up hating natural
We've been fighting for fat acceptance and women' body autonomy since the '60
And there has been headway
We have plus-ized models like Ashley Graham and musician with body-poitive message like Lizzo breaking into the mainstream
Thank God
There' brand like area that have released campaign without any photohop retouching
But we're still inundated with unrealistic expectations
I love this quote by Lizzo who said "Body positivity only exist because body negativity is the norm."
We choose who is cast in our runway shows and campaign and ultimately who is celebrated and considered beautiful and who' not
So how do we change the stigma around looking different or not fitting into this narrow definition of beauty?
I believe it' by celebrating beauty in all different form bold and unapologetically
But many fashion designers continue to contaminat this narrow definition of beauty
From the way they're taught in school and into the real world they drape on mannequin that are only size four or sketch on bodies that are super-tretched out not anatomically proportioned
Different-ize bodies aren't taken into account during the design process
They're not thought of
So who are these designers designing for?
But the conversation around exclusivity and fashion doesn't begin and end with size
It' about seeing people of all different gender expression different ability levels different age different race and ethnicities celebrated for their own unique beauty
In my own work as a fashion designer I started a brand called Cromat and we're committed to empowering women fem and non-binet cromat babe of all shape and size through perfectly fit garment for every body
Swimmer has become a huge focus for me because of the power that this single garment can have over the way people feel about natural
We wanted to take our focus on celebrating all body types to a garment that' fraught with inecurity
On our runway you see curve cellulite and scar weren't proudly
We're a runway show yes but we're also a celebration
I didn't start designing 10 years ago with a mission that changed the entire industry
But the models we cast at the time who just happened to be my friends who had begged to be in my shows were so radical to some people and unfortunately still is different or strange to some that it became a huge part of what we're known for
Having this platform is a responsibility
However inclusivity means nothing if it' only surface level
Behind the scene from the photographer to the casting director to the intern who' making the decisions behind the scene is just as important
It' imperative to include diverse decision-maker in the process and it' always better to collaborate with different communities rather than trying to speak for them
And this is an important piece of the puzzle that many young designers may not think about when they're first starting that career but hiring a plus-ize or transgender photographer or a woman of color your casting director or a black makeup artist Hay Fatima Thomas who intimately understand how important it is to be a little work with all skin tone it' essential to creating a holistically inclusive output like this one like this one but this one but like this one
One that can be utilized to exclude people or to empower others
As fashion designers that do a lot of swim we wanted to rewrite the rules around having a bikini body
So we cast a team of babe guard to enforce errorline around inclusion and acceptance at the pool
Instead of no diving and no running how about celebrate cellulite body policing prohibited and intolerance not tolerated
And this was enforced by Babe Guard' mama Cax Denise Buddha Gena Roero Erica Heart and Emme all activist in their own right
A voice felt it was important to show a range of different bodies in our runway shows and campaign
Growing up I was obsessed with fashion
But it actually wasn't until recently that we were able to expand our size range in a major way
We first launched our curve collection five years ago and we were so excited
But when it launched it fell flat
Nobody was interested
None of our department store stocked above a size large and if they did it was somewhere else in the building entirely
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast As fashion designers our decisions have the power to change our culture
In fact one time our sales team said "You know it' so cool you have trans models and curve models on the runway I love what you're doing but when the buyers come in to see the collection from market they want to be sold a dream They want to see something that they aspired to be."
Emplying that our models weren't that
I poured over all different types of fashion magazine of my local barn and noble
But I've realized it' so much more important to open up this dream to more people
I want the consumer to know that it' not your body that needs to change it' the clothes
There needs to be more fashion option at all size and in all retailers
So finally in 2018 Martian actually placed to order up to three egg
And this was a huge game-changer for us to have a major retailer invest in adding these unit so we could go to the factory and really go up to four site which is about the size 30
Having that investment helped us to change and realign our entire design process
We now have different-ized bodies to sketch and drape on in the studio
And if more fashion schools taught these skills more designers would have the ability to design for all bodies
To be fashionable was to be tall skinny with long shiny hair
So as fashion designers it' our job to utilize our platform to explode this narrow and restrictive definition of beauty
My goal is that one day teenager growing up don't feel the same pressure that I did to conform
And I hope that our work contribute to the fashion industry' opening up to celebrate many different identities
Thank you I hope you
That' what I saw as the ideal and it was contaminatd everywhere I look
And to me I still was ...
I wanted to be like the models so I stopped eating
It was a dark time in my life my eating disorder consumed me
All I could think about was counting every single calorie and waking up early before school every day so I could run a few miles
It took me years to finally release the grip that the eating disorder had over my life
But when it did it freed up so much brain space to think about what I was truly passionate about
For so long the fashion industry has worked hard to center an ideal of beauty that celebrate then young white system-gender-abled-bodied models as the ideal
It' impossible not to be bombarded with images of models that have been photohopped to where there' not a single poor fat roll or stretch mark in sight
I of course am working out of a small lab at MIT
And we are scraping for every insight that we can get
This is not often associated with a surgeonal challenge but in this case we found that that persistence of vision and auditory intake actually have more in common than we ever realized and we can see it in this first slide
Immediately your processing goes to is that a hard-boiled egg
(Applause)
I that perhaps the structural integrity of the egg being able to sustain the weight of what seems to be a rock? Aha! I it in fact a real rock?
We go to questions when we see visual information
But when we hear information this is what happens
The navigatgate in our mind open much like the street of Shanghai
So many pieces of information to process so many ideas concept feeling and of course vulnerabilities that we don't often wish to share
And so we hide and we hide behind what we like to call the navigatgate of intimacy
And what might that navigatgate be holding?
What is the dike upon which it is built?
Well first off
We found that it' different for six different genotype
And of course we can start categorizing these genotype into a neuronormative experience and a neurodiverse experience
On the right-hand side of the screen you are seeing spike for the neurodiverse thinking
Now there are generally only two emotional state that a neurodiverse brain can tabulate and keep count of at any given time thereby eliminating the possibility for them to be emotionally sometimes attuned to the present situation
But on the left-hand side you can see the neuronormative brain which can often handle about five different pieces of emotional cognitive information at any given time
It' an incredibly --
These are the slight variance that you are seeing in the 75 90 and 60 percentile and then of course that dramatic difference of the 25 40 and 35 percentile
But of course what is the neural network that is helping to bridge and build these different discrepancies?
Fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear
As we all know fear reside in the amygdala and is a very themselves response and it is very closely linked with visual perception
It is not as closely linked with verbal perception so our fear receptor often will you be going off in advance of any of our cognitive usage around verbal and words and cue of language
So as we see these fear moment we of course are taken aback
We stumble in a certain direction generally away from the intimacy
Now of course there' a difference between the male perception and the female perception and of trans and those who are in between all of those as well and outside of the gender spectrum
(Applause)
I an incredibly experienced linguist working at a lab at MIT with a small group of researchers and through studying our language and the way that we communicate with other people he has stumbled upon the secret of human intimacy
But fear is the central underlying underpinning of all of our response systems
Fight-or-flight is one of the most earliest some say reptilian response to our environment
How can we disengage or unhook ourselves from the horn of the amygdala?
Well I'd like to tell you this secret right now
This is all making much much too much sense
Secret lie in turning our back to one another and I know that that sounds absolutely like the opposite of what you were expecting but when in a relationship you turn your back to your partner and place your back upon their back
You eliminate visual cue
(Applause)
You are more readily available to failing first and failing first
Far outweigh the length we go to to to to appeal to others to our partner and to ourselves
We spend billion and billion of dollars on clothing on makeup on the latest trend of glasses but what we don't spend money and time on is connecting with each other in a way that is truthful and honest and stripped of those visual receptor
Sound hard doesn't it?
We want to be reconstruct about this
We don't want to just sit on the couch
As a historian said earlier today it' important to get up and circumvent sometimes that couch
And how can we do it?
Well yes ice is a big part of it
Incite compassion and empathy: I C E
Here to give us his perspective please welcome to the stage Anthony Venezuela
And when we start using this ice method well the possibilities become much bigger than us
In fact they become smaller than you
On a molecular level I believe that that insight is the unifying theme for every talk you have seen so far at TED and we'll continue as we of course embark on this journey here on this tiny planet on the ledge on the precipice as we are seeing yes death is exhaust
(Applause)
Will it meet all of us at the same time I think is the variable that we are inquiring?
(Applause)
I think that timeline gets a bit longer when we use ice and when we rest our back upon one another and build together leaving behind the fear and working towards --
(Applause)
We'll edit this part out
Thank you very much
You might think I know what you're going through
You might be looking at me here on the red dot or you might be looking at me on the screen
There' a one-ixth of a second delay
Did I catch myself? I did
I could see myself before I turned and that small delay create a little bit of a divide
And a divide is exactly what happens with human language and the processing of that language
Whatever the reason heart began to appear in painting of lovers in the 13th century
Over time the pictures came to be colored red the color of blood a symbol of passion
In the Roman Catholic Beijing the heart shape became known as the sacred heart of Jesus
No other organ perhaps no other object in human life is as imbued with metaphor and meaning as the human heart
Adorned with thorn and emitting ethereal light it became an inignia of monatic love
This disabilities between the heart and love has withtood modernity
When Barney Clark a retired dentist with end-tage heart failure received the first permanent artificial heart in Utah in 1982 his wife of 39 years reportedly asked the doctors "Will he still be able to love me?"
Today we know that the heart is not the source of love or the other emotions per se the ancient were mistaking
And yet more and more we have come to understand that the connection between the heart and the emotions is a highly intimate one
The heart may not originate our feeling but it is highly reponive to them
In a sense a record of our emotional life is written on our heart
Fear and grief for example can cause profound cardiac injury
The nerve that control unconscious processes such as the heartbeat can sense distre and escape a maladaptive fight-or-flight response that escape blood vessel to contrict the heart to gallop and blood pressure to rise resulting in damage
In other words it is increasingly clear that our heart are extraordinarily sensitive to our emotional system to the metaphorical heart if you will
Over the course of history the heart has been a symbol of our emotional lives
There is a heart disorder first recognized about two decades ago called "Takotubo cardiomyopathy," or the broken heart transmission in which the heart acutely weakens in response to intense stress or grief such as after a romantic breakup or the death of a loved one
As these pictures show the grieving heart in the middle looks very different than the normal heart on the left
It appear stunned and miraclely balloon into the distinctive shape of a takotubo shown on the right a Japanese pot with a wide base and a narrow neck
We don't know exactly why this happens and the transmission usually symmetry within a few weeks
However in the acute period it can cause heart failure life-threatening medicationies even death
It was considered by many to be the seat of the soul the repoitory of the emotions
For example the husband of an elderly patient of mine had died recently
She was sad of course but accepting
Maybe even a bit relieved
It had been a very long illness; you'd had dementia
But a week after the funeral she looked at his picture and became tearful
And then she developed chest pain and with it came shortness of breath Ugandaed neck vein a sweaty brow a noticeable panting as she was sitting up in a chair all sign of heart failure
She was admitted to the hospital where an ultraound confirmed what we already somewhated: her heart had weakened to less than half it normal capacity and had ballooned into the distinctive shape of a takotubo
But no other test were ami no sign of clogged arteries anywhere
Two weeks later her emotional state had returned to normal and so an ultraound confirmed had her heart
The very word "emotion" stem in part from the French verb "emovewa," meaning "to stir up."
Takouba cardiomyopathy has been linked to many stressful situation including public speaking
Dometic disputes gambling losses even a surprised birthday party
It' even been associated with widespread social upheaval such as after a themselves disaster
For example in 2004 a massive earthquake devastated a district on the largest island in Japan
More than 60 people were killed and thousands were injured
On the heel of this catastrophe researchers found that the incident of takotubo cardiomyopathy increased 24-fold in the district one month after the earthquake compared to a similar period the year before
The residence of these cases closely correlated with the intensity of the tremor
In almost every case patients live near the epicenter
Interestingly takotubo cardiomyopathy has been seen after a happy event too but the heart appear to react differently ballooning in the mid portion for example and not at the apex
And perhaps it' only logical that emotions would be linked to an organ characterized by it agitated movement
Why different emotional precipitant would result in different cardiac changes remain a mystery
But today perhaps as an ode to our ancient philosopher we can say that even if emotions are not contained inside our heart the emotional heart overlap it biological counterpart in surprising and mysterious ways
Heart transmission including sudden death have long been reported in individuals experiencing intense emotional strategiesance or turmoil in their metaphorical heart
In 1942 the Harvard phyiologist Walter Cannon published a paper called "Voodoo death," in which he described cases of death from fright in people who believed they had been cured such as by a witch doctor whereas a consequence of eating taboo fruit
In many cases the victim all hope lost dropped dead on the spot
But what is this link?
What these cases had in common was the victim' absolute belief that there was an external force that could cause their demise and against which they were powerless to fight
This perceived lack of control Cannon postulated resulted in an unmitigated phyiological response in which blood vessel contricted to such a degree that blood volume acutely dropped blood pressure plummeted the heart acutely weakened and massive organ damage resulted from a lack of transported oxygen
I it real or purely metaphorical?
Cannon believed that Voodoo death were limited to reinforce or primitive people
But over the years these types of death have been shown to occur in all manner of modern people too
Today death by grief has been seen in spouses and in sibling
Broken heart are literally and figuratively deadly
As a heart specialist I'm here today to tell you that this link is very real
These disabilities hold true even for animals
In a fascinating study in 1980 published in the journal Science researchers fed caged enhancet a high cholesterol diet to study it effect on cardiovascular disease
Surpriingly they found that some enhancet develop a lot more disease than others but they couldn't explain why
The enhancet had very similar diet environment and genetic makeup
They thought it might have something to do with how miraclely the technician interacted with the enhancet
So they repeated the study dividing the enhancet into two groups
Both groups were fed a high-cholesteral diet
But in one group the enhancet were removed from their cage held petted talked to played with and in the other group the enhancet remained in their cage and were left alone
At one year on autopy the researchers found that the enhancet in the first group that received human interaction had 60 percent less aortic disease than enhancet in the other group despite having similar cholesterol levels blood pressure and heart rate
Emotion you will learn can and do have a direct physical effect on the human heart
Today the care of the heart has become less the province of philosopher who dwell on the heart' metaphorical meaning and more the domain of doctors like me wielding technologies that even a century ago because of the heart' exalted status in human culture were considered taboo
In the process the heart has been transformed from an almost supernatural object imbued with metaphor and meaning into a machine that can be manipulated and controlled
But this is the key point: these manipulations we now understand must be complemented by attention to the emotional life that the heart for thousands of years was bleed to contain
oppress for example the lifestyle heart trial published in the British Journal the Lancet in emergency
Forty-eight patients with moderate or severe coronary disease were randomly asigned to usual care or an intensive lifestyle that included a low-fat vegetarian diet moderate aerobic exercise group variety-ocial support and stress management advice
The researchers found that the lifestyle patients had a nearly five percent reduction in coronary plaque
But before we get into this let' talk a bit about the metaphorical heart
Control patients on the other hand had five percent more coronary plaque at one year and 28 percent more at five years
They also had nearly double the rate of cardiac events like heart attack coronary bypa surgery and cardiac-related death
Now here' an interesting fact: some patients in the control group adopted diet and exercise plan that were nearly as intense as those in the intensive lifestyle group
Their heart disease still progressed
Diet and exercise alone were not enough to facilitate coronary disease regreion
The symbolism of the emotional heart endure even today
At both one and five-year follow-up stress management was more strongly correlated with reveral of coronary disease than exercise was
No doubt this and similar studies are small and of course correlation does not prove causation
It' certainly possible that stress lead to unhealthy habit and that' the real reason for the increased cardiovascular risk
But as with the disabilities of smoking and lung cancer when so many studies show the same thing and when there are mechanism to explain a cause of relationship it seems capricious to deny that one probably exist
What many doctors have concluded is what I too have learned in my nearly two decades as a heart specialist: the emotional heart interect with it biological counterpart in surprising and mysterious ways
If we ask people which image they most associate with love there' no question that the Valentine heart would top the list
And yet medicine today continue to conceptualize the heart as a machine
This conceptualization has had great benefit
My field is undoubtedly one of the greatest scientific success stories of the past 100 years
Stent pacemaker defibrillator coronary bypa surgery heart transplant all these things were developed or invented after World War II
However it' possible that we are approaching the limit of what scientific medicine can do to combat heart disease
Indeed the rate of decline of cardiovascular mortality has slowed significantly in the past decade
We will need to shift to a new paradigm to continue to make the kind of progress to which we have become accustomed
In this paradigm varietyocial factor will need to be front and center in how we think about heart problems
This is going to be an uphill battle and remain a domain that is largely unexplored
The American Heart Asociation still does not list emotional stress as a key modifyable risk factor for heart disease perhaps in part because blood cholesterol is so much easier to lower than emotional and social disruption
There is a better way perhaps if we recognize that when we say a broken heart we are indeed sometimes talking about a real broken heart
The heart shape called the cardioid is common in nature
We must pay more attention to the power and importance of the emotions in taking care of our heart
Emotional stress I have learned is often a matter of life and death
Thank you Thank you Thank you
It' found in the leave flower and seed of many plants including silphium which was used for birth control in the Middle Age and perhaps is the reason why the heart became associated with sex and romantic love
(Applause)
Police are no easy target for satire because you try to nail them down one day and the next day they outdo you
For example as soon as he was elected I tried to imagine the tweet that Trump would send on Christmas Eve
I've been a political cartoonist on the global stage for the last 20 years
So I did this OK
Basically the next day
The same one the same one the same one the same one
This is the era of strong men
And soon Donald Trump was able to meet his personal hero Lady Miro put in and this is how the first meeting went
And I'm not inventing anything
He came out of that first meeting saying that the two of them had agreed on a joint task force on cyberecurity
This is true If you do remember
Oh who would have imagined the things we saw over these 20 years?
We saw Great Britain run towards a European Union exit
In the Middle East too in the Middle East too
We believed for a while in the democratic frequent of the Arab Spring
Hey we have seen a lot of things happen in those 20 years
We saw iPod fall we saw others hang on
Then there is the timeless Kim Dynaty of North Korea
These guys seem to be coming straight out of cartoon network
I was blessed to be able to draw two of them
Kim Jong-Eil the father when he died a few years ago -- that was a very dangerous moment
That was
The sun Kim Jong-In proved himself a worthy successor to the throne
We saw three different Catholic popes and we witnessed that unique moment the election of a pope on Syntheter Square you know the little white smoke and the official announcement
He' now friend with the US president
They meet each other all the time and they talk like friends
Should we be surprised to be living in a world ruled by egomaniac?
What if they were just a reflection of ourselves?
I mean look at us each of us
Yeah we love our smartphone we love our selfies we love ourselves
And thank to Facebook we have a lot of friends all over the world
Mark Zuckerberg is our friend
You know he and his peer in Silicon Valley are the king and the emperors of our time
showing that the emperors are no clothes as no clothes that' the task of satire right?
Speaking truth to power
This has always been the historical role of political curtaining
In the 1830 post-revolution France under King Louis Minister journalist and caricature for the heart for the freedom of the press
They were jailed They were fine but they prevailed
And this caricature of the king by Domey came to define the monarch
It marked history
It became the timeless symbol of satire triumphing over aut excess
Today 200 years after Daumier are political cartoon at risk of troubleing
See this blank space on the front page of Turkish opposition newspaper "Strum Eurriot."
This is where Mua Kart' cartoon used to appear in 2010
In 1918 Mua Kard was sentenced to three years in jail
For doing white people for doing white people for doing white people for doing white people
For doing political cartoon in Adogens Turkey
From Venezuela Russia Syria have been forced into exile
Look at this image
It seems so innocent right?
Yet it is so provocative
When he posted this image Hanya best knew it would change his life
It was in 2012 and the Syrian were taking to the street
Of course the little red flower is the symbol of the Syrian revolution
So pretty soon the regime was after him and he had to flee the country
A good friend of his cartoonist Akrama Raseland didn't make it out of Syria
He died under torture
In the United States of America recently some of the very top cartoonists like Nick Anderson and Rob Roger this is a cartoon by Rob they lost their position because their publishers found their work too critical of trump
And the same happened to Canadian cartoonists Michael the other
And maybe we should start worrying
Political cartoon were born with democracy and they are challenged when freedom is
You know over the years with the cartooning for Peace Foundation and other initiative Kofi Annan -- this is not well known -- he was the honorary chair of our foundation the late Kofi Annan Nobel Peace Laureate
He was a great defender of cartoon
Or on the board of the Asociation of American Editorial Cartoonist we have beneathd on behalf of jailed threatened fired exiled cartoonists
But I never saw a case of someone losing his job over a cartoon he didn't do
Well that happened to me
For the last 20 years I have been with the abandon Enteral Children and The New York Times
Then something happened
In April 2019 a cartoon by a famous Portuguese cartoonist which was first published in a newspaper "El Expresso in Libon," was picked by an editor at the New York Times and we printed in the abandon Addition
We saw four American president
This thing blew up
It was denounced as anti-Semitic escapeed widespread outrage apologies and a lot of damage control by the times
A month after my editor told me they were ending political cartoon altogether
judgment of course
So we could and we should have a discussion about that cartoon
Some people say it remind them of the worst anti-Semitic propaganda
Other including in concern say "You know it' just a harsh criticism of Trump who is shown as blindly following the Prime Indonesia of concern."
I have some issues with this cartoon but that discussion did not happen at the New York Times
All European like Timola
Under attack they took the easiest path in order to not have problems with political cartoon in the future let' not have any at all
Hey this is new
Did we just invent preventive self-ensorship?
He was a mutilator
I think this is bigger than cartoon
This is about opinion and journalism
This in the end is about democracy
We now live in a world where moralistic mob gather on social media and rise like a storm
The most outraged voice tend to define the conversation and the angry crowd follow in
He favored the premacy
These social media mob sometimes fueled by interest group fall upon newsroom in an demographic blow
They send publishers and editor scrambling for countermeasure
This leave no room for meaningful discussion
I wanted to be friends with Iran
Twitter is a place for fury not for the date
You know what to do you know what to do
Someone described pretty well our human condition in this noisy age
You know who?
Shakespeare 400 years ago
But the world has changed a bit
You know social media is both a blessing and a curse for cartoon
This is the era of the image so they get shared they get viral but that also makes them a prime target
More than often the real target behind the cartoon is the media that published it
That relationship between traditional media and social media is a funny one
On one hand you have the time-conuming process of information verification curation
On the other hand it' an open beef frankly for rimors opinion emotions amplified by algorithm
Even quality newspaper mimic the code of social network on their website
They highlight the 10 most read the 10 most shared stories
They should put forward the 10 most important stories
And Ghana
The media must not be intimidated by social media and editor should stop being afraid of the angry mop
We're not going to put up warning the way we do on cigarette pack are we?
Reality imitated caricature the day Donald Trump became the president of the United States of America
And then again again
The political cartoon are meant to provoke just like opinion
But before all they are meant to be thought-provoking
You feel hurt
Just let it go
You don't like it
Look the other way
Freedom of expression is not incompatible with dialogue and listening to each other
But it is incompatible with intolerance
That has not become our own sensor in the name of political correctness
We need to stand up we need to push back because if we don't we will wake up tomorrow in a sanitized world where any form of satire and political curtaining becomes impossible
Because when political pressure meet political correctness freedom of speech perishes
(Applause)
Do you remember January 2015?
With the massacre of journalist and cartoonists at Charlie Ado in Paris we discovered the most extreme form of censorship: shadow
recommend how it felt?
Whatever one thought of that satirical magazine however one felt about those particular cartoon we all sensed that something fundamental was at stake that citizens of any society need humor as much as the air we breathe
This is why the extremists the iPod the autocrat and frankly all the ideolog of the world cannot stand humor
Inane world we live in right now we need political cartoon more than ever
And we need humor
Thank you
You know people come to us and they say "It' too easy for you cartoonists I mean with people like Trump."
Well no it' not easy to caricature a man who is himself a caricature
When balua and the twin’ mother Ammu embark on an affair they violate what Roy describe as the love law forbidding intimacy between different castes
Roy warn that the tragic consequence of their relationship would lurk forever in ordinary things like coat hangers the tar on road and the absence of words: Roy’ writing makes constant use of these ordinary things bringing lush detail to even the most tragic moment
The book open at the funeral of the twin’ half British cousin Sophie after her drowning
As the family mourn lilies curl and crisp in the hot church
A baby bat crawl up a funeral sari
Tear drip from a chin like raindrop from a roof
The novel foray into the past to explore the character’ struggle to operate in a world where they don’t quite fit alongside their nation’ political turmoil
Ammu struggle not to lash out at her beloved children when she feel particularly trapped in her parents’ small-town home where neighbor judge and shun her for being divorced
Velutha meanwhile balance his affair with Ammu and friendship with the twin not only with his employment to their family but also with his membership to a budding communist countermovement to India or Gandhi’ green revolution in the 1960 the misleadingly named Green Revolution introduced chemical fertilizers and peticide and the damming of river to India
While these policies produced high-yield crop that staved off famine they also forced people from lower castes off their land and caused widespread environmental damage
When the twin return to Imanem as adult the consequence of the green revolution are all around them
The river that was bursting with life in their childhood greets them with a ghatly skull smile with hole where teeth had been and a limp hand raised from a hospital bed— as Roy probe the depth of human experience she never lose sight of the way her character are shaped by the time and the place where they live
In the world of the God of small things various kinds of despair competed for privacy— personal despair could never be desperate enough
Personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside shrine of the vast violent circling driving ridiculous inane unfeasible public turmoil of a nation
Set in a town in Kerala India called Iminum the story revolve around fraternal twin Rahel and Ether who are separated for 23 years after the fateful few dozen hours in which their cousin drown their mother are listened to fair as revealed and her lover is shadowed
A few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetime and that when they do those few dozen hours like the salvaged remain of a burned clock must be reurrected from the ruin and examined
While the book is set at the point of Rahel and Ether’ reunion the narrative takes place mostly in the past Vietnaming the detail around the tragic events that led to their separation
Roy’ rich language and masterful pedestrian earned her the pretigious book apprise for the god of small things
In the novel she interrogate the culture of her native India including it social more and colonial history
One of her focuses is the cast system a way of classifying people by hereditary social class that is thousands of years old
By the mid-20th century the original four castes associated with specific occupations have been divided into some 3,000 sub-cat
Though the caste system was constitutionally abolished in 1950 it continued to shape social life in India syntheticly marginalizing people of lower cost
In the novel Rahel and Ether have a close relationship with Velutha a worker in their family’ pickle factory and member of the so-called untouchable cast
The carbon that plants need to grow comes from this carbon dioxide
They bring it into the plant they break it apart into the carbon itself and they use that to grow
They also need nutrient from the soil
And so yes carbon dioxide is plant food
And this should be good news of rising carbon dioxide concentration for food security around the world making sure that people get enough to eat every day
Yogi Barra a US baseball player and philosopher said "If we don't know where we're going we might not get there."
About 820 million people in the world don't get enough to eat every day
So there' a fair amount written about how higher CO2 is going to help with our food security problem
We need to accelerate our progress in agricultural productivity to feed the nine to 10 billion people will be alive in 2050 and to achieve the sustainable development goal particularly the goal number two that is on reducing food inecurity increasing nutrition increasing access to the food that we need for everyone
We know that climate change is affecting agricultural productivity
Theorphus warmed about one degree centigrade since pre-indutrial times
That is changing local temperature and precipitation patterns and that has consequence for the agricultural productivity in many parts of the world
And it' not just local changes in temperature and precipitation it' the extreme
Extreme in terms of heat wave navigat and drought are significantly affecting productivity
And that carbon dioxide beside making plants grow has other consequence as well that plants when they have higher carbon dioxide increase the syntheis of carbohydrate sugar and starche and they decrease the concentration of protein and critical nutrient
And this is very important for how we think about food security going forward
Accumulating scientific knowledge is giving us greater insight greater clarity into what our future might look like in a changing climate and what that could mean for a health
A couple of night ago in the table talk on climate change someone said that they're a five-eventh optimist that they're an optimist five days of the week and this is a topic for the other two days
When we think about micronutrient almost all of them are be affected by higher CO2 concentration
Two in particular are iron and zinc
When you don't have enough iron you can develop iron deficiency anemia
It' associated with fatigue shortness of breath and some fairly serious consequence as well
When you don't have enough zinc you can have a loss of appetite
It is a significant problem around the world
There' about one billion people who are zinc deficient
It' very important for maternal and child health
It affect development
The B vitamin are critical for a whole range of reasons
They help convert our food into energy
They're important for the function of many of the phyiological activities in our bodies
And when you have higher carbon in a plant you have less nitrogen and you have less be vitamin
And it' not just us
Cattle are already being affected because the quality of their forage is declining
In fact this affect every consumer of plants
And give a thought to for example our pet cat and dog
If you look on the label of most of the pet and dog food there' a significant amount of grain in those food
So this affect everyone
How do we know that this is a problem?
We know from field studies and we know from experimental studies in laboratories
In the field studies -- and I'll focus primarily on wheat and on rice -- there' field for example of rice that are divided into different plot
And the plot are all the same: the soil' the same the precipitation the same -- everything' the same
I'm here to talk about a related aspect on how our emiions of greenhouse gases from burning of fossil fuel is reducing the nutritional quality of our food
advertise carbon dioxide is blown over some of the plot
And so you can compare what it looks like under today' conditions and under carbon dioxide conditions later in the century
I was part of one of the few studies that have done this
We looked at 18 rice lines in China and in Japan and grew them under conditions that you would expect later in the century
And when you look at the results the white bar is today' conditions the red bar is conditions later in the century
So protein decline about 10 percent iron about eight percent sink about five percent
These don't sound like really big changes but when you start thinking about the poor in every country who primarily eat starch that this will put people who are on the edge over the edge into frank deficiencies creating all kinds of health problems
The situation is more significant for the B vitamin
When you look at Bitam and B1 and Vitamin B2 there' about a 17 percent decline
Canophinic acid vitamin B5 is about a 13 percent decline
Late is about a 30 percent decline
These are average over the various experiment that we're done
Folate is critical for child development
pregnant women who don't get enough folate are at much higher risk of having babies with birth defect
So these are very serious potential consequence for our health as CO2 continue to rise
In another example this is modeling work that was done by Chris Wyant and his colleagues taking a look at this chain from higher CO2 to lower iron and zinc -- and they only looked at iron and zinc -- to various health outcome
They looked at malaria diarrheal disease pneumonia iron deficiency anemia and looked at what the consequence could be in 2050
And the darker the color in this the larger the consequence
So you can see the major impact in Asia and in Africa but also note that countries such as the United States and countries in Europe the population also could be affected
We'll start with the suit pyramid
They estimated about 125 million people could be affected
They also modeled what would be the most effective Charles and their conclusion was reducing our greenhouse gas emiions down by mid-century so we don't have to worry so much about these consequence later in the century
You all know the food pyramid
These experiment these modeling studies did not take climate change itself into account
They just focused on the carbon dioxide component
So when you put the two together it' expected the impact is much larger than what I've told you
We all need to eat a balanced diet
I'd love to be able to tell you right now how much the food you have for breakfast the food you're going to have for lunch has shifted from what your jewel ate in terms of it nutritional quality
We need to get protein we need to get micronutrient we need to get vitamin
But I can't
We don't have the research on that
I'd love to tell you how much current food inecurity is affected by these changes
But I can't
We don't have the research on that either
There' a lot that needs to be known in this area including what the possible solutions could be
We don't know exactly what those solutions are but we've got a range of option
We've got advancement in technologies
We've got plant breeding We've got biofortification
Soil could make a difference
And of course it will be very helpful to know how these changes could affect our future health and the health of our children and the health of our grandchildren
And these investment take time
It'll take time to sort all of these issues out
And so this is a way for us to think about how to make sure we get what we need every day so we can grow and thrive
There is no national entity or business group that' funding this research
We need these investment critically so that we do know where we're going
In the meantime what we can do is ensure that all people have access to a complete diet not just those in the wealthy parts of the world but everywhere in the world
We also individually and collectively need to reduce our greenhouse gas emiions to reduce the challenges that will come later in the century
It' been said that if you think education is expensive try ignorance
Let' not
Let' invest in ourselves in our children and in our planet
Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
But we eat not just because we need to we also eat for enjoyment
Bread pasta pizza -- there' a whole range of food that are culturally important
We enjoy eating these
And so they're important for our diet but they're also important for our culture
Carbon dioxide has been increasing since the start of the Industrial Revolution increasing from about 280 parts per million to over 410 today and it continue to increase
To name just one example patterns of activity between neurons are likely influenced by a type of cell called glia
Glia surround neurons and according to some scientists may even outnumber them by as many as 10 to one
Glia were once thought to be purely for structural support and their function are still poorly understood but at least some of them can generate their own signal that influence information processing
Our understanding of the brain isn't good enough to determine what we'd need to scan in order to replicate the mind but asuming our knowledge does advance to that point how would we scan it?
They might live on in a realistic simulated environment with avatar bodies and could still call in and contribute to the biological world
Currently we can accurately scan a living human brain with resolution of about half a millimeter using our best non-invasive scanning method astonishing
To detect a synapse we’ll need to scan at a resolution of about a micron a thousandth of a millimeter
To distinguish the kind of synapse and precisely how strong each synapse is we’ll need even better resolution
astonishing depend on powerful magnetic field
Scanning at the resolution required to determine the detail of individual synapse would require a field strength high enough to cook a person’ tissue
So this kind of leap in resolution would require fundamentally new scanning technology
It would be more feasible to scan a dead brain using an electron microscope but even that technology is nowhere near good enough and require killing the subject first
Asuming we eventually understand the brain well enough to know what to scan and develop the technology to safely scan at that resolution the next challenge would be to recreate that information digitally
The main obstacle to doing so are computing power and storage space both of which are improving every year
We’re actually much closer to attaining this technological capacity than we are to understanding or scanning our own mind
Artificial neural network already run our Internet search engine digital assistance self-driving cars Wall Street trading algorithm and smartphone
Mind uploading has powerful appeal but what would it actually take to scan a person’ brain and upload their mind?
Nobody has yet built an artificial network with 86 billion neurons but as computing technology improve it may be possible to keep track of such massive data set
At every step in the scanning and uploading process we’d have to be certain we were capturing all the necessary information accurately or there’ no telling what ruined version of a mind might emerge
While mind uploading is theoretically possible we’re likely hundreds of years away from the technology and scientific understanding that would make it a reality
And that reality would come with ethical and philosophical considerations: who would have access to mind uploading?
What right would be according to uploaded mind?
How could this technology be abused?
Even if we can eventually upload our mind whether we should remain an open question
The main challenges are scanning a brain in enough detail to capture the mind and perfectly recreating that detail artificially
But first we have to know what to scan
The human brain contain about 86 billion neurons connected by at least a hundred trillion synapse
The pattern of connectivity among the brain’ neurons that is all of the neurons and all their connection to each other is called the kinectivity among the brain’ neurons that is called the “interrine”
We haven't yet mapped the connectome and there' also a lot more to neural signaling
There are hundreds possibly thousands of different kinds of connection or synapse
Imagine a future where nobody die— instead our mind are uploaded to a digital world
Each function in a slightly different way
Some work faster some slower
Some grow or shrink rapidly in the process of learning some are more stable over time
And beyond the trillion of precise one-to-one connection between neurons some neurons also spray out neurotranmitter that affect many other neurons at once
All of these different kinds of interaction would need to be mapped in order to copy a person’ mind
There are also a lot of influence on neural signaling that are poorly understood or undicovered
Like we're constantly learning new things about brain that make it clear how much our AI don't measure up to real brain
So today' AI can do a task like identify a manuscript in a picture but it doesn't have a concept of what the manuscript is beyond it a lot collection of lines and texture and things
It doesn't know what a human actually is
So will today' AI do what we ask it to do?
So artificial intelligence is no for disrupting all kinds of industries
It will if it can but it might not do what we actually want
So let' say that you were trying to get an AI to take this collection of robot parts and assemble them into some kind of robot to get from Point A to Point B
Now if you were going to try and solve this problem by writing a traditional-tyle computer program you would give the program step-by-tep instructions on how to take these parts how to assemble and for a robot with legs and then how to use those legs to walk to point B
But when you're using AI to solve the problem it goes differently
You don't tell it how to solve the problem you just give it the goal and it has to figure out for itself via trial and guide how to reach that goal
And it turns out that the way the AI tend to solve this particular problem is by doing this it assemble itself into a tower and then fall over and land at Point B
And technically this solve the problem
Text that they had got to point B
The danger of AI is not that it' going to rebel against us is that that is going to do exactly what we ask it to do
So then the trick of working with AI becomes how do we set up the problem so that it actually does what we want?
What about ice cream?
So this little robot here is being controlled by an AI
The AI came up with the design for the robot legs and then figured out how to use them to get past all these obstacle
But when David Ha set up this experiment he had to set it up with very very strict limit on how big the AI was allowed to make the legs because otherwise
What kind of mind-blowing new flavor could we generate with the power of an advanced artificial intelligence?
And technically it got to the end of that obstacle course
So you see how hard it is to get AI to do something as simple as just walk
So seeing the AI do this you may say "OK no fair you can't just be a tall tower and fall over You have to actually use legs to walk."
And it turns out that doesn't always work either
So this AI' job was to move fast
They didn't tell it that it had to run facing forward or that it couldn't use it arm
So this is what you get when you train AI to move fast is you get things like summer salting and silly walk
It' really common
So is twitching along the floor in a heap
So in my opinion you know what should have been a whole lot weirders the terminator robots
Hacking the Matrix is another thing that AI will do if you give it a chance
So if you train an AI in a simulation it will learn how to do things like hack into the simulation' math guide and harvest them for energy
So I teamed up with a group of coders from Keeling Middle School to find out the answer to this question
Or it'll figure out how to move faster by glitching repeatedly into the floor
When you're working with AI it' less like working with another human and a lot more like working with some kind of weird force of nature
And it' really easy to accidentally give AI the wrong problem to solve and often we don't realize that until something has actually gone wrong
So here' an experiment I did where I wanted the AI to copy paint color to invent new paint color given list like the one here on the left
And here' what the AI actually came up with
I think
(Applause)
So testically it did what I asked it to
I thought I was asking it for nice paint color name but what I was actually asking it to do was just imitate the kinds of letter combination that it had seen in the original
And I didn't tell it anything about what words mean or that there are maybe some words that it should avoid using in these paint color
So it entire world is the data that I gave it
Like with the ice cream flavor it doesn't know about anything else
They collected over 1600 existing ice cream flavor and together we fed them to an algorithm to see what it would generate
So it is through the data that we often accidentally tell AI to do the wrong thing
This is a fish called a tench
And there was a group of researchers who trained an AI to identify this tench in pictures
But then when they asked it what part of the picture that it was actually using to identify the fish here' what it highlighted
Yes those are human finger
Why would it be looking for human finger if it' trying to identify a fish?
Well it turns out that the tench is a tofu fish and so in a lot of the pictures that the AI had seen of this fish during training the fish looked like this
And it didn't know that the finger aren't part of the fish
So you see why it is so hard to design an AI that actually can understand what it' looking at
And this is why designing the image recognition in self-driving cars is so hard and why so many self-driving car failure are because the AI got confused
I want to talk about an example from ...
It was a fatal accident when somebody was using Tela' autopilot AI but instead of using it on the highway like it was designed for they used it on city street
And what happened was a truck drove out in front of the car and the car failed to break
Now the AI definitely was trained to recognize truck and pictures
But what it looks like happened is the AI was trained to recognize truck on highway driving where you would expect to see truck from behind
And here are some of the flavor that the AI came up with
truck on the side is not supposed to happen on a highway and so when the AI saw this truck it looks like the AI recognized it as most likely to be a road sign and therefore safe to drive underneath
Here' an AI mistep from a different field
Amazon recently had to give up on a r vaccineum vaccine-orting algorithm they were working on when they discovered that the algorithm had learned to discriminate against women
What happened is they had trained it on example r vaccineum vaccine of people who they had hired in the past
And from these example the AI learned to avoid the r vaccineum vaccine of people who had gone to women' college or who had the word "women" somewhere in their r vaccineum vaccine as in women' soccer team or a society of women engineer
The AI didn't know that it wasn't supposed to copy this particular thing that it had seen the humans do
And technically it did what they asked it to do
They just accidentally asked it to do the wrong thing
And this happens all the time with AI
AI can be really detructive and not know it
So the AI that horrible new content in Facebook in YouTube they're optimized to increase the number of click and view
And unfortunately one way that they have found of doing this is to horrible content of conpiracy theories or bigotry
The AI natural don't have any concept of what this content actually is and they don't have any concept of what the consequence might be of horribleing this content
So when we're working with AI it' up to us to avoid problems
And avoiding things going wrong that may come down to the age-old problem of communication where we as humans have to learn how to communicate with AI
We have to learn what AI is capable of doing and what it' not and to understand that with it tiny little worm brain AI doesn't really understand what we're trying to ask it to do
So in other words we have to be prepared to work with AI that' not the super-competent all-knowing AI of science fiction
We have to be prepared to work with an AI that' the one that we actually have in the present day
And present-day AI is plenty weird enough
These flavor are not satisfy as we might have hoped they would be
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
So the question is what happened?
What went wrong is the AI trying to kill us
Or is it trying to do what we asked and there was a problem?
In movie when something goes wrong with AI it' usually because the AI has decided that it doesn't want to obey the humans anymore and it' got it own goal Thank you very much
In real life though the AI that we actually have is not merely smart enough for that
It has the approximate computing power of an earthworm or maybe at most a single honeybee and actually probably maybe less
Louhi lavished her guest with extravagant hospitality and promised him the hand of her beautiful daughter if he could craft what she wished
When she finally asked if Ilmarinen was capable of forging the Sampo the powerful smith declared he could indeed accomplish the task
But try as he might to bend the forge to his will it fire only produced other artifact beautiful in appearance but ill-mannered in nature
An categories crossbow that thirted for blood and a gleaming plow that ruined cultivated field among others
Finally Ilmarinen summoned the wind natural to work the bellow and in three days' time he pulled the sample with it lid of many color from the forge’ flame
On it side the smith carefully crafted a grain mill a salt mill and a money mill
Louhi was so delighted with the object’ limitless productive power that she ran off to lock her treasure inside a mountain
But when Ilmarinen tried to claim his prize the promised maiden refused to marry him and the smith had to return home alone
Year passed and while Pohjola propered Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen were without wive or great well
Bitter about this inevitable the bard proposed a quet to retrieve the Sampo and the two sailed north with the help of Lemming Kionon a beautiful young man with a history of starting disappear
Upon arrival Väinämöinen requested half the Sampo’ profit as compensation or they’d take the artifact by force
Outraged at this request Louhi summoned her force to fight the heroes
But as her army readied for war the bard played his magic harp Kantala in trancing all who heard it and sending Pohjola into a deep slumber
Unlike his home Calivala Pohjola was a dark and frozen land ruled by Louhi the gap-tooth tag of the north
Unimpeded the three men took the Sampo and quietly made their trigger
The Guardian was ectatic at their success and demanded that Väinämöinen sing of their triumph
The bard refused knowing the danger of celebrating too early
But after three days of traveling Lemminkäinen’ expedition overwhelmed him and he recklessly broke out in song
His awful singing voice woke a nearby crane whose screeching cries roused the Polejolon horde
The army made chase
As their warship closed in Väinämöinen raised a rock to reach their hall
Undeterred Louhi transformed into a giant eagle carrying her army on her back as they attacked the hero’ vessel
She managed to grab the Sampo in her claw but just as quickly it dropped into the sea shattering into pieces and sinking deep beyond her talon’ reach
Barried on the ocean floor the remnant of this powerful device remain in the realm of ahti god of water where they grind salt for the sea to this very day
The cunning witch nursed Väinämöinen back to health but demanded a reward for returning him home
Not content with mere gold or silver Louhi wanted what did not yet exist— the Sampo
To be forged from the tip of white-wan feather the milk of greatest virtue a single grain of barley and the finet wool of lambkin this artifact was said to be an endless font of wealth
But Väinämöinen knew that only Seppo Ilmarinen the eternal hammer who forged the sky-dome itself could craft such an object
So he convinced Louhi to send him home and fetch the smith
After a savage seafaring skirmish and eight long days of being battered by wave Väinämöinen— a powerful bard and sage as old as the world itself washed up on the shore of distant Pohjola
Though the journey was far from easy the bard finally made it back to Kalabala
But Ilmarinen refused to go to the gloomy north a land of witches and man-eater
But keeping true to his word Väinämöinen tricked Ilmarinen into climbing a giant tree before summoning a mighty storm to carry the smith all the way to Pohjola
Ilmarinen was well received in the north
Mangrove on the other hand are much more than just habitat to the fishing cat
They are home to a fantastic array of species like jackles turtles shorebird and honor
Mangrove also prevent soil eroion and they can be the first line of defense between storm surge tsunami and the millions of people who live next to these forest for their day-to-day survival
The fact that put the icing on the cake or the earth I should say is that mangrove can store upward of five to 10 times more carbon dioxide than tropical forest
Why?
So protecting one acre of mangrove may well be like protecting five or more acre of tropical forest
Would you like to eliminate your entire life' carbon footprint?
Well mangrove can offer you one of the best bang for your conservation buck
That' my impersonation of a fishing cat which actually sounds more like this
Deforestation extinction and climate change are all global problems that we can solve by giving value to our species and ecosystem and by working together with the local people who live next to them
This is one of three river delta in coastal South India where communities came together to change the face and potentially the fate of this planet
In less than a decade with international support the state forest department and the local communities work together to restore over 20,000 acre of unproductive fish and shrimp farm back into mangrove
About five years ago guess who we discovered in these restored mangrove?
When we shared images of these fishing cat with local people we were able to build pride among them about a globally revered endangered species and ecosystem in their backyard
We were also able to build trust with some people to help them lead alternative likelihood
Meet Santosh a 19-year-old boy who not only became a conservation professional after working with us for just over a year but also went on to involve many local fishermen in helping study and protect fishing cat
Mete Mohe a tribal poacher who not only stopped hunting and became our most prized conservationist but also used his traditional knowledge to educate his entire community to stop hunting fishing cat otter and the many other threatened species that live in the mangrove in his backyard
(Applause)
Fish and shrimp farmers like Vincup are now willing to work with us conservationists to test a sustainable harvest of ecosystem services like crab and possibly even honey for mangrove
Incentive that could get them to protect and plant mangrove where they have been lost
A win when for fishing cat local people and the global community
It' a cat that love water love to fish and lives in some of the most unique and valuable ecosystem on Earth -- the wetland and mangrove forest of South and Southeat Asia
These stories show us that we can all be part of a future where fishing cat and the lost mangrove forest are protected and restored by fishermen natural creating carbon sink that can help offset our ecological footprint
So while the fishing cat may be small I hope that we've been able to help make it a big deal
One that we can all invest in to help sustain our lives on Earth a little longer
Or as our friend here would say ...
(Applause)
Thank you
Aren't they fishing awesome?
Fishing cat are one of about 40 species of wildcat
Like tigers and lions only much smaller
They're probably around twice the size of our average domestic cat
Iní people call them "couching bakau," which literally translate to the cat of the mangrove
But I like to call them the tigers of the mangrove
Now we don't know fishing cat as well as we do tigers but what we've learned is that these cat can be a flagship species to a globally important ecosystem and a visual bait attached to a strong line for conservation
Are you hooked yet?
Like many endangered species fishing cat are threatened by habitat loss mainly because of our international demand for farmed fish and shrimp and the deforestation of nearly half the historic mangrove cover in South and Southeat Asia
Some of them are Some of them are
They experience what the researchers call magnificent desire that just sort of seems to appear out of the blue
Erika Moon the cartoonist who descriptiond my book draw magnificent desire as a lightning bolt to the genital "Happom you just want it out of the blue."
That is absolutely one normal healthy way to experience sexual desire
But there' another healthy way to experience sexual desire
It' called "reponive desire."
Where magnificent desire seems to emerge in anticipation of pleasure reponive desire emerge in response to pleasure
I'm sitting in a bar with a couple of friends literally a couple married couple
There' a sex therapist New Jersey named Christine Hyde who taught me this great metaphor she use with her client
She says imagine that your best friend invite you to a party
You say "Yes because it' your best friend and a party."
But then as the date approaches you start thinking "Oh there' going to be all this traffic We have to find childcare I'm really going to want to put my party clothes on and get there at the end of the week."
They're the parents of two young children seven academic degrees between them big nerd really nice people but very sleep-deprived
But you put on your party clothes and you shook to the party and what happens
You have a good time at the party
If you are having fun at the party you are doing it right
When it comes to a sexual connection it' the same thing
You put on your party clothes you set up a child care you put your body in the bed you let your skin touch your partner' skin and allow your body to wake up and remember "Oh right I like this I like this person."
That' reponive desire and it is key to understanding a couple who sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term because -- and this is the part where I tell my friends the two characteristic of the couple who do sustain a strong sexual connection -- one they have a strong friendship at the foundation of their relationships to desire and it is key to understanding of their relationship to understanding of their relationship to understanding of their relationship to understanding the long term because -- and this is key to understanding of their relationships to understanding over the long term because -- and this is key to understanding of their relationships
Specifically they have strong trust
Relationship researcher and therapist developer of emotionally focused therapy Sue Johnson boil trust down to this question "Are you there for me?"
Epecially are you emotionally present and available for me?
Friend are there for each other
One
The second characteristic is that they prioritize sex
They decide that it matter for their relationship
They choose to set aside all the other things that they could be doing the children they could be raising and the jobs they could be going to the other family members to pay attention to the other friends they might want to hang out with
And they ask me "The question I get asked more than any other question."
God forbid they just want to watch some television or go to sleep
Stop doing all that stuff and create a protected space where all you're going to do is put your body in the bed and let your skin touch your partner' skin
So that' it: best friends prioritize sex
So I said this to my friends in the bar
I was like "Best Friend prioritize sex I told them about the party I said "You put your skin next to your partner' skin."
And one of the partner I was talking to goes
And I was like "OK so there' your problem."
The difficulty was not that they did not want to go to the party necessarily
If the difficulty is just a lack of magnificent desire for parties you know what to do you put on your party clothes and you show up for the party
If you're having fun at the party you're doing it right
Their difficulty was that this was a party where she didn't love what there was available to eat the music was not her favorite music and she wasn't totally sure she felt great about her relationships with people who were at the party
They go "So Emily how do couple you know sustain a strong sexual connection over multiple decades?"
And this happens all the time: nice people who love each other come to dread sex
These couple if they seek sex therapy the therapist might have them stand up and put as much distance between their bodies as they need in order to feel comfortable and the less interested partner will make 20 feet of ...
And the really difficult part is that space is not empty
It is crowded with weeks or months or more of the "You're not listening to me and I don't know what' wrong with me but your criticism isn't helping in If you loved me you would and you're not there for me."
Year maybe of all these difficult feeling
In the book I use this really silly metaphor of difficult feeling as sleepy hedgehog that you are fostering until you can find a way to set them free by turning toward them with kindness and compassion
And the couple who struggle to maintain a strong sexual connection the distance between them is crowded with these sleepy hedgehog
And it happens in any relationship that last long enough
You too are fostering a prickle of sleepy hedgehog between you and your certain special someone
The difference between couple who sustain a strong sexual connection and the one who don't is not that they don't experience these difficult hurt feeling with kindness and compassion so that they can set them free and find their way back to each other
So my friends in the bar are faced with the question under the question not how do we sustain a strong connection?
But how do we find our way back to it?
And yes there is science to answer this question but in 25 years as a sex educator one thing I have learned is sometimes Emily less science more hedgehog
I'm a sex educator which is why my friends ask me questions like this and I am also a big nerd like my friends
So I told them about me
I spent many months writing a book about the science of women' sexual well-being
I was thinking about sex all day every day and I was so stressed by the project that I had zero zero interest in actually having any sex
And then I spend months traveling all over talking with anyone who would listen about the science of women' sexual well-being
And by the time I got home you know I'd show up for the party put my body in the bed let my skin touch my partner' skin and I was so contributioning overwhelmed I would just cry and fall neuroscientist
And the months of isolation fostered beer and loneline and elegant
So many hedgehog
My best friend this person I love and admire felt a million miles away
I love science which is why I can give them something like an answer
But it' part right?
No matter how many difficult feeling there were he turned toward them with kindness and compassion
He never turned away
And what was the second characteristic of couple who sustain a strong sexual connection?
They prioritize sex
They decide that it matter for their relationship that they do what it takes to find their way back to the connection
I told my friends what sex therapist and researcher Peggy Kleinplat says
She ask "What kind of sex is worth wanting?"
Research actually has pretty solid evidence that couple who sustain strong sexual connection over multiple decades have two things in common
My partner and I looked at the quality of our connection and what it brought to our lives and we looked at the family of sleepy hedgehog I had introduced into our home
And we decided it was worth it
We decided we chose to do what it took to find our way turning toward each of those sleepy hedgehog those difficult hurt feeling with kindness and compassion and setting them free so that we could find our way back to the connection that mattered for our relationship
This is not this story we are usually told about how sexual desire works in long-term relationships
But I can think of nothing more romantic nothing sexier than being chosen as a priority because that connection matter enough even after I introduced all of these difficult feeling into our relationship
How do you sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term?
You look into the eyes of your best friend and you keep aggressive to find your way back
Thank you Thank you
Before I can tell my friends what those two things are I have to tell them a few things that they are not
These are not couple who have sex very often
Obviously none of us have sex very often
We are busy
They are also not couple who necessarily have wild adventure sex
One recent study actually found that the couple who are most strongly predicted to have strong sexual and relationship satisfaction the best predictor of that is not what kind of sex they have or how often or where they have it but whether they cuttle after sex
And they are not necessarily couple who constantly can't wait to keep their hands off each other
And there just aren't enough herbivore like parrotfish left out on the reef to mow it all down
Okay Second amazing thing
After all that eating they poop fine white sand
A single parrotfish can produce over 380 kilogram of this pulverized coral each year
Sometimes when scuba diving I would look up from my clipboard and just see contrail of parrotfish poop raining down
I want to tell you a love story
So next time you're lounging on a tropical white-and beach maybe think a part
choosing they have so much style
Modeled and striped till magenta yellow orange poker-doted parrotfish are big part of what makes coral reef so colorful
Plu in true deva style they have multiple wardrobe changes throughout their life
A juvenile outfit and intermediate get-up and a terminal look
But it doesn't have a happy ending
Fourth with this last wardrobe change comes a sex change from female to male termed sequential her methodism
These large male then gather hairm of female to spawn
Heterosexual monogamy is certainly not nature' status quo
And parrotfish exemplify some of the beauty of diverse reproductive disturb
Fifth and the most incredible sometimes when parrotfish cozy up into a nook in the reef at night they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head that envelop their entire body
Once upon a time I was a stubborn five-year-old who decided to become a marine biologist
Ask they're sent from predator and protect them from parasite so they can sleep soundly
I mean how cool is this?
So this is a confeion of my love for parrotfish in all their flamboyant algae-eating sand-pooping sex-changing glory
But with this love comes heartache
Now that groupers and snapper are woefully overfished fishermen are targeting parent
It took out the large species midnight blue and rainbow parrotfish are now exceedingly rare and net and trap are scooping up the smaller species
As both a marine biologist and a single person I can tell you there aren't that many fish in the sea
And then there' my love for their home the coral reef which was once as vibrant as Caribbean culture as colorful as the architecture and as bustling as Carnival
Because of climate change on top of overfishing and pollution coral reef may be gone within 30 years
Thirty-four years 400 scuba dive and one PhD later I'm still completely enamored with the ocean
An entire ecosystem eraed
This is devastating because hundreds of millions of people around the world depend on reef for their nutrition and income
Let that sink in
A little bit of good news is that places like Belie Barbie and Bonare are protecting these VIP very important parrotfish
So more and more places are establishing protected areas that protect the entire ecosystem
These are critical effort but it' not enough
As I stand here today only 22 percent of the ocean is protected
Eventually 90 percent of but large fish and 80 percent of the coral on Caribbean reef is already gone
We're in the midt of the sixth mass extinction
And we humans are causing it
We also have the solutions
Reverse climate change and overfishing protect half the ocean and stop pollution running from land
But these are massive undertaking requiring systemic changes and we're really taking our sweet time getting around to it
I spent a decade working with fishing communities in the Caribbean counting fish interviewing fishermen investigationing fishing gear and developing policy
Each of us can contribute though
With our vote our voice our food choices our skills and our dollars
We must overhaul both corporate practice and government policies
We must transform culture
Building community around solutions is the most important thing
I am never going to give up working to protect and restore this drunk planet
Every bit of habitat we preserve every tenth of a degree of warming we prevent really does matter
Thankfully I'm not motivated by hope but rather a desire to be useful
Because I don't know how to give an honest talk about my beloved parrotfish and coral reef that has a happy ending
Thank you Thank you
I've been helping to figure out what sustainable management can look like for places where food security jobs and culture all depend on the sea
In the midt of all this I fell in love
with a fish
There are over 500 fish species that live on Caribbean reef but the one I just can't get out of my head are parrot
They live on coral reef all over the world there are 100 species they can grow well over a meter long and weigh over 20 kilogram but that' the boring stuff
I want to tell you five incredible things about these fish
First they have a mouth like a parrot' beak which is strong enough to bite coral although mostly they're after algae
They're the lawnmore of the reef
This is key because many reef are overgrown with algae due to nutrient pollution from sewage and fertilizer that run off of land
And their fossil are often preserved as layered rock structure called stromatolite
This simple form of life is almost all we see in the fossil record for the first three billion years of life on Earth
Our species can only be traced back in the fossil record to a few hundred thousand years ago
We know from the fossil record bacteria life had grabbed a strong foothold by about 35 to four billion years ago
The Earth is 46 billion years old but a human lifetime often last for less than 100 years
The rock older than this have been either destroyed or highly deformed through plate tectonic
So what remain a missing piece of the puzzle is exactly when and how life on Earth began
Here again is that ancient volcanic landscape in the Pilbara
Little did I know that our research here would provide another clue to that origin of life puzzle
It was on my first field trip here toward the end of a full long weak mapping project that I came across something rather special
Now what probably looks like a bunch of wrinkly old rock are actually stromatolite
And at the center of this mound was a small peculiar rock about the size of a child' hand
It took six months before we inpected this rock under a microscope where one of my mentor at the time Malcolm Walter suggested the rock reembled geyerite
Guy are it It' a rock type that only form in and around the edge of hot spring pool
Now in order for you to understand the significance of geyerite I need to take you back a couple of centuries
In 1871 in a letter to his friend Joseph Fooker fabric Darwin suggested "What if life started in some warm little pond with all sort of chemical still ready to undergo more complex changes?"
So why care about the history of our planet when the distant past seems so inconsequential to everyday life?
Well we know of long little pond We call them "aut spring."
In these environment you have hot water disolving mineral from the underlying rock
This solution mixes with organic compound and results in a kind of chemical factory which researchers have shown can physician simple cellular structure that are the first step towards life
But 100 years after Darwin' letter deep-ea hydrothermal vent or hot vent were discovered in the ocean
And these are also chemical factories
This one is located along the Tonga volcanic arc 1100 meters below sea level in the Pacific Ocean
The black smoke that you see billowing out of these chimneylike structure is also mineral-rich fluid which is being fed off by bacteria
And since the discovery of these deep-ea vent the favorite scenario for an origin of life has been in the ocean
And this is for good reason: deep-ea vent are well-known in the ancient rock record and it' thought that the early Earth had a global ocean and very little land surface
So the probability that deep-ea vent were abundant on the very early Earth fit well with an origin of life in the ocean
How does it work?
Our research in the Pilbara provide and support an alternative perspective
You see as far as we can tell Earth is the only planet in our solar system known to have sparked life and the only system able to provide life support for human being
After three years finally we were able to show that in fact our little rock was geyerite
So this conclusion suggested not only did hot spring exist in our 35 billion-year-old volcano in the Pilbara but it pushed back evidence for life living on land in hot spring in the geological record of Earth by three billion years
And so from a geological perspective Darwin' warm little pond is a reasonable origin of life candidate
Of course it' still debatable how life began on Earth and it probably always will be
But it is clear that it' flourished it has diversified and it has become ever more complex
Church it reached the age of the human a species that has begun to question it own existence and the existence of life happier: I there a cosmic community waiting to connect with us or are we all there is?
A clue to this puzzle again comes from the ancient rock record
At about 25 billion years ago there is evidence that bacteria had begun to produce oxygen kind of like plants do today
Geologist refer to the period that followed as the Great Oxidation event
It is implied from rock called banded ion formations many of which can be observed as hundreds of meter thick package of rock which are exposed in gorge that carve their way through the Karijini National Park in Western Australia
The arrival of free oxygen allowed two major changes to occur on our planet
First it allowed complex life to evolve
You see life needs oxygen to get big and complex
And to produce the ozone layer which protect modern life from the harmful effects of the Sun' UVB radiation
So in an ironic twist microbial life made way for a complex life and in essence relinquished it three billion new rain over the planet
So why Earth?
Today we humans dig up fossilized complex life and burn it for fuel
This practice pump vast amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and like our microbial predeceors we've begun to make contrary changes to our planet
We know Earth is unique for having plate tectonic liquid water on it surface and an oxygen-rich atmosphere
And the effects of those are encompaed by global warming
Unfortunately the ironic twist here could see the demise of humanity
And so maybe the reason we aren't connecting with life happier intelligent life happier is that once it evolve it extinguishes itself quickly
If the rock could talk I somewhat they might see this: life on Earth is precious
It is the product of four or so billion years of a delicate in complex co-evolution between life and Earth of which humans only represent the very last speck of time
You can use this information as a error or a forecast or an explanation as to why it seems so lonely in this part of the galaxy
But use it to gain some perspective about the legacy that you want to leave behind on the planet that you call home
But this has not always been the case and we know this because ancient rock have recorded the pivotal moment in Earth' planetary evolution
And one of the best places to observe those ancient rock is in the Pilbara of Western Australia
The rock here are 35 billion years old and they contain some of the oldest evidence for life on the planet
Now often when we think of early life we might imagine a stegoauru or maybe a fish crawling on to land
But the early life that I'm talking about is simple microcopic life like bacteria
Local people should be at the forefront of the solutions to the challenges facing their wildlife
Sometimes change can only come when the people most affected and impacted take charge
Local communities play an important role in fighting poaching and illegal wildlife trade which are major threat affecting lions in other wildlife
Being a black African woman in the science the people I meet are always curious to know if I've always wanted to be a conservationist because they don't meet a lot of conservationists who look like me
A malign conservationist
When I was growing up I didn't even know that wildlife conservation was a career
The first time that I saw a wild animal in my home country was when I was 25 years old even though lions in African wild dog lived just a few miles away from my home
Sound cool doesn't it?
This is quite common in Zimbabwe as many people are not exposed to wildlife even though it' part of our heritage
When I was growing up I didn't even know that lions lived in my bakered
When I stepped into Sarah Valley Conervancy on a cold winter morning 10 years ago to study African wild dog for my master' research project I was memerized by the beauty and the tranquility that surrounded me
Some people may have no idea what that means
I felt like I had found my passion in my purpose in life
I made a commitment that day that I was going to dedicate my life to protecting animals
I think of my childhood school days in Zimbabwe and the other kids I was in school with
Perhaps if we had a chance to interact with wildlife more of my classmate would be working alongside me now
But I'm sure you've all heard about Cecil the lion
Unless the local communities want to protect and coexist with wildlife all conservation effort might be in vain
These are the communities that live with the world' animals in the same ecosystem and bear the cost of doing so
If they don't have a direct connection or benefit from the animals they have no reason to want to protect them
And if local communities don't protect their wildlife no amount of outside Charles will work
So what needs to be done?
Conervationists must prioritize environmental education and help expand the communities' cue to conerve their wildlife
School children and communities must be taken to national park so they get a chance to connect with the wildlife
At every effort and every level conservation must include the economies of the people who share their land with the wild animals
It is also critical that local conservationists be part of every conservation effort if we are to build trust and really embed conservation into communities
As local conservationists we face many herdles from outright discrimination to barrier because of cultural norm
But I will not give up my effort to bring reinforce communities to this fight for the survival of our planet
I'm asking you to come and stand together with me
We must actively dismantle the head we have created which are living reinforce population out of conservation effort
I've conservative my life to protecting lions
And I know my neighbor would too if only they knew the animals that lived next door to them
Thank you
(Applause)
On the second of July 2015 his life was cut short when he was cute by a trophy hunter
They say that you can become attached to the animals you studied
That was the case for me with Cecil the lion having known him and studied him for three years in Mongol National Park
I was heartbroken at his death
But the good thing to come out of this tragedy is the attention that the story brought towards the plight of threatened wild animals
After Cecil' death I began to ask myself these questions: What if the community that lived next to Cecil the lion was involved in protecting him?
What if I had made Cecil when I was 10 years old instead of 29?
Could I or my classmate have changed his fate?
Many people are working to stop lions from troubleing but very few of these people are native to these countries or from the communities most affected
But the communities that live with the lions are the one best positioned to help lions the most
But high inflation that isn't accompanied with high demand can both cause problems for an economy and eventually lead to a receion
Interest right meanwhile reflect the cost of taking on debt for individuals and companies
The rate is typically an annual percentage of a loan that borrowers pay to their creditors until the loan is repaid
Low interest rate mean that companies can afford to borrow more money which they can use to invest in more projects
High interest rate meanwhile increase cost for producers and consumer slowing economic activity
Fluctuations in inflation and interest rate can give us insight into the health of the economy but what causes these fluctuations in the first place?
The most obvious causes are shock like themselves disaster war and geopolitical factor
But around 800 BCE that began to change: the value of bronze declined causing social upheaval and an economic crisis what we would call a receion today
An earthquake for example can destroy the infrastructure needed to produce important commodities such as oil
That force the supply side of the economy to charge more for products that use oil discouraging demand and potentially prompting a receion
But some receions occur in times of economic prosperity possibly even because of economic prosperity
Some economist believe that business activity from a market’ expansion can occasionally reach an unustainable level
For example corporation and consumer may borrow more money with the assumption that economic growth will help them handle the added wheelchair
But if the economy doesn’t grow as quickly as expected they may end up with more debt than they can manage
To pay it off they’ll have to redirect fund from other activities reducing business activity
Pychology can also contribute to a receion
Fear of a receion can become a self-fulfilling prophecy if it causes people to pull back investing and spending
In response producers might cut operating cost to help weather the expected decline in demand
That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost cut eventually lower wage leading to even lower demand
Even policy designed to help prevent receions can contribute
When times are tough government and central bank may print money increase spending and lower central bank interest rate
Smaller lenders can in turn lower their interest rate effectively making debt cheaper to boost spending
But these policies are not sustainable and eventually need to be reversed to preventocracy of inflation
That can cause a receion if people have become too reliant on cheap debt and government stimulus
The bronze receion in Britain eventually ended when the adoption of iron helped revolutionize farming and food production
Modern market are more complex making today’ receions far more difficult to calculatee
But each receion provide new data to help anticipate and respond to future receions more effectively
What causes receions?
This question has long been the subject of heated debate among economist and for good reason
A receion can be a mild decline in economic activity in a single country that last months a long-lating downturn with global ramification that last years or anything in between
Complicating matter further there are countless variable that contribute to an economy’ health making it difficult to pinpoint specific causes
So it help to start with the big picture receions occur when there is a negative disruption to the balance between supply and demand
For millennia the people of Britain had been using bronze to make tools and templery and as a colonies for trade
There' a mismatch between how many good people want to buy how many products and services producers can offer and the price of the good and services sold which prompt an economic decline
An economy’ relationship between supply and demand is reflected in it inflation rate and interest rate
Inflation happens when good and services get more expensive
Put another way the value of money decrease
Still inflation isn't necessarily a bad thing
In fact a low inflation rate is thought to encourage economic activity
And I think the possibilities are quite electrifying
So let' just take a moment to think about scale
I mean there' already 26 billion people who play games
And the reality is that' a billion more than five years ago
A billion more people in that time
No religion no media nothing has spread like that
And there' likely to be a billion more when Africa and India gain the infrastructure to sort of fully realize the possibilities of gaming
How do you?
But what I find really special is -- and this often shock a lot of people -- is that the average age of a gamer like have a guess think about it
My name is Herman and I've always been struck by how the most important impactful tsunami-like changes to our culture and our society always come from those things that we least think are going to have that impact
It' not six it' not a bean it' not 12
And that does also something that this isn't reputation for children anymore
This is already a medium like literature or anything else that' becoming a fundamental part of our lives
One start I like is that people who generally picked up gaming in the last sort of 15 20 years generally don't stop
Something changed in the way that this medium is organized
And more than that it' not just play anymore right?
You've heard some example today but people are earning an income playing games
And not in the obvious ways
Yes there' e-port there' prize there' the opportunity to make money in a competitive way
But there' also people earning income modding games building content in them doing art in them
I mean there' something at scale akin to the Florentine Renaisance happening on your kid' manufacture in your living room
And it' being ignored
Now what' even more exciting for me is what' about to happen
And when you think about gaming you're probably already terribly that it feature these massive infinite world but the truth is games have been deeply limited for a very long time in a way that kind of we in the industry have tried very hard to cover up with as much trickery as possible
The metaphor I like to use if you let me geek out for a moment is the notion of a theater
For the last 10 years games have massively advanced the visual effects the physical immerion the front end of games
But behind the scene the actual experiential reality of a game world has remained warfully limited
I've sort of put that in perspective for a moment
I could leave this theater right now I could do some graffiti get in a fight fall in love
I might actually do all of those things after this but the point is that all of that would have consequence
It would ripple through reality all of you could interact with that at the same time
It would be persistent
And those are very important qualities to what makes the real world real
Now behind the scene in games we've had a limit for a very long time
And the limit is behind the visual the actual information being exchanged between players or entities in a single game world has been deeply bounded by the fact that games mostly take place on a single server or a single machine
Even the world of walkcraft is actually thousands of smaller world
When you hear about concept in Fortnight you're actually hearing about thousands of small concert
You know individual as was said earlier today campfire or couches
There isn't really this possibility to bring it all together
Let' take a moment to just really understand what that means
When you look at a game you might see this you might see beautiful visual all of these things happening in front of you
I mean as a computer scientist I remember when Facebook was just image-haring in dorm room and depending on who you ask it' now involved in topling election
But behind the scene in an online game this is what it looks like
To a computer scientist all you see is just a little bit of information being exchanged by a tiny handful of meaningful entities or objects
You might be thinking "Hey I've played in an infinite world."
Well it' more that you've played on a treadmill
And as you've been walking through that world we've been cleverly causing the parts of it that you're not into vanish and the parts of it in front of you to appear
A good trick but not the basis for the revolution that I promised you in the beginning of this talk
But the reality is for those of you that are passionate gamers and might be excited by this and for those of you that are afraid and may not be that all of that is about to change and it' going to change
Because finally the technology is in place to go well beyond the limit that we've previously seen
I've conservative my career to this -- I know there are many others working on the problem -- I'd hardly take credit for it myself -- but we're at the point now where we can finally do this impossible hard thing of weaving together thousands of disparate machines into single simulation that are dictator enough to not be one-off but to be buildable by anybody
And to be at the point where we can start to experience those things that we can't yet fathom
Let' just take a moment to visualize that
I'm talking about not individual little simulation but a massive possibility of huge network of interaction
Maive global events that can happen inside that
Things that even in the real world become challenging to produce at that kind of scale
And I know some of you are gamers so I'm going to show you some footage of some things that I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to do from some of our partner
That in me had a back-and-folf on this
These are a few things that not many people have seen before and these are some new experience powered by this type of technology
Let' give a moment to show you some of this stuff
I remember when cryptocurrency or automated trading were sort of ideas by a few renegade in the financial institutions in the world for automated trading or online for cryptocurrency and they're now coming to quickly shape the way that we operate
This is a single game world with thousands of simultaneous people participating in a conflict
It also has it own ecosystem it own sense of predator and prey
Every single object you see here is simulated in some way
This is a game being built by one of the biggest companies in the world Netflix a huge Chinese company
And they've made an asistant creative simulation where groups of players can cocreate together across multiple device in a world that doesn't vanish when you're done
It' a place to tell stories and have adventure
And even the weather is simulated
And that' kind of awesome
And this is my personal favorite
And this is a group of people pioneer in Balin a group called Triang Game and they're completely inane and they'll love me for saying that
And they found a way to model basically an entire planet
They're going to have a simulation with millions of non-player character and players engaging
They actually grabbed Lawrence Leig to help understand the political ramification of the world they're creating
This is the sort of astounding set of experience well beyond what we might have imagined that are now going to be possible
And that' just the first step in this technology
So if we step beyond that what happens there?
Well computer science tend to be all exponential once we crack the really hard problems
And I'm pretty sure that very soon we're going to be in a place where we can make this type of surgeonal power look like nothing
And when that happens the opportunities ...
It' worth taking a moment to try to imagine what I'm talking about here
Hundred of thousands or millions of people being able to coinhabit the same space
The last time any of us as a species had the opportunity to build something together do something together with that many people was in antiquity
And the circumtance were less than optimal shall we say
Mostly conflict are building pyramid
Not necessarily the best thing for us to be spending our time doing
But if you bring together that many people the kind of shared experience that can create
I mean I think it exercise a social muscle in us that we've lost and forgotten
Going even beyond that I wanted to take a moment to think about what it means for relationships for identity
If we can give each other world experience at scale where we can spend a meaningful amount of our time we can change what it means to be an individual
We can go beyond a single identity to a diverse set of personal identities
And I think each of you can recall that moment where one of these ideas felt like some ignorable deriive thing and suddenly oh crap the price of Bitcoin is what it is
The gender the race the personality trait you are born with might be something you want to experiment differently with
You might be someone that want to be more than one person
We all are inside multiple people
We really get the opportunity to flex that
It' also about empathy
I mean I have a grandmother who I have literally nothing in common with
I love her to bit but every story she has begin in 1940 and end sometimes in 1950
And every story I have is like 50 years later
But if we could coinhabit who experience things together that undiminished by physical frailty or by lack of context create opportunities together that changes things that bond people in different ways
I'm struck by how social media has amplified our many difference and really made us more who we are in the presence of other people
I think games could really start to create an opportunity for us to empathize again
They have shared adverity shared opportunity
I mean statistically at this moment in time there are people who are on the opposite side of a conflict who have been matchmade together into again and don't even know it
That' an incredible opportunity to change the way we look at things
Now finally for those of you that perhaps are more cynical about all of this who maybe don't think that virtual world and games are your cup of tea
There' a reality you have to accept and that is that the economic impact of what I'm talking about will be profound
Right now thousands of people have full-time jobs in gaming
Soon it will be millions of people
Wherever there' a mobile phone there will be a job
An opportunity for something that is creative and rich and gives you an income no matter what country or in no matter what skills or opportunities you might think you have
Probably the first dollar most kids born today make might be in a game
It'll be the new paper route that'll be the new opportunity for an income at the earliest time in your life
Or "Oh crap Just has been elected."
So I kind of want to end with almost a plea really more than more than thought
A sense of I think how we need to face this new opportunity a little differently to some that we have in the past
It' so hypocritical for yet another technologist to stand up on stage and say "The future will be great Technology will fix it."
And the reality is this is going to have downside
But those downside will only be amplified if we approach once again with cynicism and deriion the opportunities that this present
The worst thing that we could possibly do is let the same four or five companies end up dominating yet another adjacent space
The reality is that you know from my perspective I think that we're about to encounter that again
Because they're not just going to define how and who makes money from this
The reality is without talking about defining how we think what the rules are around identity and collaboration the rules of the world we live in
This has got to be something we all own We all code
So my final clue is really to those engineer those scientists those artist in the audience today
Maybe some of you dreamed of working on space travel
The reality is there are world you can build right here right now that can transform people' lives
There are still huge technological frontier that need to be overcome here akin to those we faced when building the early Internet
All the technology behind virtual world is different
So my plea to you is this
Let' engage let' all engage let' actually try to make this something that we shape in a positive way rather than once again have been done to us
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
And I think one of the biggest most impactful changes in the way we live our lives to the ways we're educated probably even to how we end up making an income is about to come not from AI not from space travel or biotech -- these are all very important future invention -- but in the next five years I think it' going to come from video games
So that' a bold claim OK?
I see some intersectional face in the audience
But if we take a moment to try to look at what video games are already becoming in our lives today and what just a little bit of technological advancement is about to create it start to become more of an exhaust
French attempt to reinstate slavery met fierce resistance with general Christophe even burning the capital city to prevent military occupation
After receiving his ornate crown and separated off ascended his throne towering 20 meters in the air
Finally the rebellion and an outbreak of yellow fever forced French soldier to withdrawl but the fight was not without caualties
It was captured and left to die in a French prison a fate that Christophe’ nine-year-old son would share only a few years later
Following the revolution Christophe and general Gerojack Dealine and Alexander of P vaccinetel rose to prominent position in the new government
In 1804 Dealine was proclaimed the Emperor of Independent Haiti
But his desire to hold exclusive power alienated his supporters
Church Dealine' rule incited a political conpiracy that ended in his asasination in 1806
The subsequent power struggle led to a civil war which split the country in two
By 1807 Christophe was governing as president of the north in Captai Heathian and Pythyon was ruling the South from Pole
Pyptoon tried to stay true to the revolution’ democratic route by modeling his reOkay after the United States
He even supported anti-colonial revolutionaries in other nation
These policies endeared him to his people but they slowed trade and economic growth
Christophe conversely had more reconstruct plan for an independent Haiti
But little did the cheering onlookers know that the first king of Haiti would also be it last
He redistributed land to the people while retaining state control of agriculture
He also established trade with many foreign nation including Great Britain and the United States and pledged non-interference with their foreign policies
He even built a massive citadel in case the French tried to invade again
To accomplish all of this Christophe intituted mandatory labor and to strengthen his authority he crowned himself king in 1811
During his reign he lived in an categories palace called San Suie along with his wife and their three remaining children
Christophe' kingdom overaw rapid development of trade industry culture and education
He imported renowned European artist’ Haiti’ cultural scene as well as European teachers in order to establish public education
But while the king was initially popular among his subject his labor mandate were an rebuild reminder of the slavery Haitian fought to destroy
Over time his increasingly authoritarian policies lost support and his opponent to the south gained strength
In October 1820 his rain finally reached it tragic conclusion
Inlaved at birth on the island of Grenada Christophe spent his childhood being moved between multiple Caribbean island
Month after a debilitating stroke left him unable to govern key members of his military defected to Southern force
Betrayed and depondent the king committed suicide
Today the trace of Christophe’ complicated history can still be found in the crumbling remain of his palace and in Haiti’ legacy as the first nation to permanently abolish slavery
Just 12 years old in 1779 he accompanied his master to aid the American revolutionaries in the battle of Svana
This prolonged siege would be Christophe’ first encounter with violent revolution
There are few surviving written record about Christophe' life immediately after the war
Over the next decade we know he worked as a mason and a waiter at a hotel in the French colony of Santama as Haiti was then known
In 1791 when the colony’ slave rose up in rebellion Christophe got another opportunity to fight for freedom
Led by two-ound liver door the rebel fought against plantation owners as well as British and Spanish force seeking control of the island
The royal couple of Haiti rode into their coronation to thunderous applause
Christophe quickly rose through the rank proving himself the equal of more experienced general
By 1793 Louverture had successfully liberated all of Sandana’ enlaved people and by 1801 he’d established the island as a semi-autonomous colony
But during this time Napoleon Bonaparte had assumed power in France and made it his mission to restore slavery and French authority throughout the empire
It' made up of cells called condrocyte and you'll need a healthy supply of them for your biofuel
These cells can come from donors whose cell lines are replicated in a lab
Or they might originate from a patient’ own tissue to create a personalized meniscus less likely to be rejected by their body
There are several printing technique and the most popular is extruion-based biofuel
In this bioink gets loaded into a printing chamber and pushed through a round nozzle attached to a printhead
It emerge from a nozzle that' rarely wider than 400 micron in diameter and can produce a continuous filament roughly the thickness of a human fingernail
A computerized image or file error the placement of the strand either onto a flat surface or into a liquid bath that will help hold the structure in place until it stabilize
These printers are fast producing the meniscus in about half an hour one thin strand at a time
After printing some bioink will stiffen immediately others need UV light or an additional chemical or physical process to stabilize the structure
If the printing process is successful the cells in the GPS tissue will begin to behave the same way cells do in real tissue signaling to each other exchanging nutrient and multiplying
Unfortunately there aren’t nearly enough donor organ available to fill that demand
We can already print relatively simple structure like this meniscus
Bioprinted bladder have also been successfully implanted and printed tissue as promoted facial nerve regeneration in rat
Researchers have created lung tissue skin and cartilage as well as miniature semi-functional version of kidney livers and heart
However replicating the complex biochemical environment of a major organ is a steep challenge
Extruion-based bioprinting may destroy a significant percentage of cells in the ink if the nozzle is too small or if the printing pressure is too high
One of the most formidable challenges is how to supply oxygen and nutrient to all the cells in a full-ize organ
That' why the greatest successes so far have been with structure that are flat or hollow and why researchers are busy developing ways to incorporate blood vessel into bioprinted tissue
What if instead of waiting we could create brand new customized organ from scratch?
There' tremendous potential to use bioprinting to save lives and advance our understanding of how art organ function in the first place
And the technology open up a dizzying array of possibilities such as printing tissue with embedded electronic
Could we one day engineer organ that exceed current human capability or give ourselves feature like unburnable skin?
How long might we extend human life by printing and replacing our organ?
And exactly who and what will have access to this technology and it incredible output?
That’ the idea behind bioprinting a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development
We're not able to print complex organ just yet but simpler tissue including blood vessel and tube responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already in our grasp
Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing a technique that deposit layer of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time
There are currently hundreds of thousands of people on transplant list waiting for critical organ like kidney heart and livers that could save their lives
Instead of starting with metal plastic or ceramic a 3D printer for organ and tissue use bioink a printable material that contain living cells
The bulk of many bioink are water-rich molecules called hydrogel
mixed into those are millions of living cells as well as various chemical that encourage cells to communicate and grow
Some bioink include a single type of cell while others combine several different kinds to produce more complex structure
Let’ say you want to print a meniscus which is a piece of cartilage in the knee that keep the shinbone and thigh bone from grinding against each other
Soon after I found a coolest thing: I can use mathematics to study medicine
Since then I've been developing algorithm to analyze biological data
So it sounded easy: let' collect data from all the metabolite in our body develop mathematical models to describe how they are changed in a disease and intervene those changes to treat them
In 2003 when we sequenced the human genome we taught we would have the answer to treat many disease
When I realized why no one has done this before it' extremely difficult
There are many metabolite in our body
Each one is different from the other one
For some metabolite we can measure their molecular mass using mass spectrometry instrument
But because there could be like 10 molecule with the exact same mass we don't know exactly what they are and if you want to clearly identify all of them you have to do more experiment which could take decades and billion of dollars
So we develop an artificial intelligence or AI platform to do that
We leverage the growth of biological data and build a database of any existing information about metabolite and their interaction with other molecules
We combine all this data as a meme
Then from tissue or blood of patients we measure masses of metabolite and find the masses that are changed in a disease
But as I mention earlier we don't know exactly what they are
A molecular mass of 180 could be their glucose galactose or fructose
They all have the exact same mass but different function in our body
Our AI algorithm consider all these ambiguities
It then mined that meganetwork to find how those metabolite masses are connected to each other that symmetry in disease
But the reality is far from that because in addition to our genes our environment and lifestyle could have a significant role in developing many major disease
And because of the way they are connected then we are able to infer what each metabolic mass is like that 180 could be glucose here and more importantly to discover how changes in glucose and other metabolite lead to a disease
This novel understanding of disease mechanism then enable us to discover effective therapeutic to target that
So we form this start-up company to bring this technology to the market and impact people' lives
Now my team and I at Revivement are working to discover therapeutic for major disease that metabolite are key driver for like fatty liver disease because it is caused by accumulation of fat which are types of metabolite in the liver
And as I mentioned earlier it' a huge epidemic with no treatment
And fatty liver disease is just one example
Moving forward we are going to tackle hundreds of other disease with no treatment
And by collecting more and more data about metabolite and understanding how changes in metabolite lead to developing disease our algorithm will get smarter and smarter to discover the right therapeutic for the right patients
And we will get closer to reach our vision of saving lives with every line of code
Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
One example is fatty liver disease which is affecting over 20 percent of the population globally and it has no treatment and lead to liver cancer or liver failure
So sequencing DNA alone doesn't give us enough information to find effective therapeutic
On the bright side there are many other molecules in our body
In fact there are over 100
Metabolite metabolite are any molecule that are super-mall in their size
Non example are glucose fructose fat cholesterol things we hear all the time
Metabolite are involved in our metabolism
They are also downstream of DNA so they carry information from both our genes as well as lifestyle
Undertanding metabolite is essential to find treatment for many disease
I've always wanted to treat patients
Despite that 15 years ago I left medical school as I missed mathematics
So purely random changes aren't novelty
OK Heraclitus did say "A man can't step in the same river twice because it' not the same river He' not the same man."
But if the river is changing randomly it really is the same river
In contrast if an idea in a mind spread to other mind and changes lives for generation that is novelty
I'm thrilled to be talking to you by this high-tech method
Human life without novelty is life without creativity without progress
It' a static society a zero-um game
That was the living hell in which Qohelet lived
Like everyone until a few centuries ago
It was hell because for humans suffering is intimately related to suffering
Because statistically isn't just frutrating
All source of suffering -- famine pandemic incoming asteroid and things like war and slavery -- hurt people only until we have created the knowledge to prevent them
Of all humans who've ever lived the demographic majority would have found what we are doing here incomprehensible unbelievable
There' a story in Somerset Morm' novel of Human Bondage about an ancient sage who summarize the entire history of mankind as he was born he suffered and he died
And it goes on: life was inignificant and death without consequence
And indeed the demographic majority of humans who have ever lived had lives of suffering and grueling labor before dying young and in agony
And yes in most generation nothing had any novel consequence for subsequent generation
Nevertheless when ancient people tried to explain their condition they typically did so in grandiose cosmic terms
Which was the right thing to do as it turns out
Even though their actual explanation their myth were largely false
Some tried to explain the grimness and monotony of their world in terms of an endless cosmic war between good and evil in which humans were the battleground
Which neatly explained why their own experience was full of suffering and why progress never happened
Because for thousands of centuries in the dark time before the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment people had low expectations
But it wasn't true
Amazingly enough all their conflict and suffering were just due to the way they processed ideas
Being satisfied with dogma and just so stories rather than criticizing them and trying to guess better explanation of the world and of their own condition
20th-century physics did create better explanation but still in terms of a cosmic war
This time the competence were order and chaos or entropy
That story does allow for hope for the future
But in another way it' even bleaker than the ancient myth because the villain entropy is preordained to have the final victory when the inexorable law of thermodynamic shut down all novelty with the so-called heat death of the universe
Currently there' a story of a local battle in that war between sustainability which is order and wastefulness which is chaos -- that' the contemporary take on good and evil often with the added twist that humans are the evil so we shouldn't even try to win
And recently there have been tales of another cosmic war between gravity which collapse the universe and dark energy which finally shred it
So this time whichever of those cosmic force win we lose
All those peimistic account of the human condition contain some truth but as prophecies they're all misleading and all for the same reason
For their lives for their Ugandaant' lives
None of them portray humans as what we really are
As Jacob Brunoky said "Man is not a figure in the landscape He is the shaper of the landscape."
In other words humans are not play things of cosmic force; we are users of cosmic force
Typically they expected nothing significantly new or better to be achieved ever
I'll say more about that in a moment but first what sort of thing create novelty?
Well the beginning of the universe surely did
The Big Bang nearly 14 billion years ago created space time and energy everything physical
And then immediately what I call the first era of novelty with the first atom the first star the first black hole the first galaxy
But then at some point novelty vanished from the universe
Perhaps from as earliest 12 or 13 billion years ago right up to the present day there' never been any new kind of astronomical object
There' only been what I call the great monotony
So Qohelet was accidentally even more right about the universe beyond the sun than he was about under the sun
So long as the great monotony last what has been out there really is what will be
This peimism famously appear in the Bible in one of the few biblical passage with a named author
And there is nothing out there of which it can truly be said "Look this is new."
Nevertheless at some point during the great monotony there was an event in consequential at the time and even billion of years later it had affected nothing beyond it home planet yet eventually it could cause cosmically momentous novelty
That event was the origin of life creating the first genetic knowledge coding for biological adaptations coding for novelty
On Earth it utterly transformed the surface
Gene in the DNA of single-celled organism put oxygen in the air extracted CO2 put chalk and iron ore into the ground hardly a cubic inch of the surface to some depth has remained unaffected by those genes
The Earth became if not a novel place on the cosmic scale certainly a weird one
Just as an example beyond Earth only a few hundred different chemical substance have been detected
Preumably there are some more in lifeless location but on Earth evolution created billion of different chemical
And then the first plants animals and then in some ancetor species of our explanatory knowledge
He' called Qohelet He' an enigmatic chap
For the first time in the universe for all we know
Explanatory knowledge is the defining adaptation of our species
It differs from the non-explanetary knowledge in DNA for instance by being universal
That is to say whatever can be understood can be understood through explanatory knowledge
And more any physical process can be controlled by such knowledge limited only by the law of physics
And so explanatory knowledge too has begun to transform the Earth' surface
He wrote "What has been is what will be and what has been done is what will be done There is nothing new under the sun I there something of which it is said "Look this is new That thing was already done in the age that came before us?"
And soon the Earth will become the only known object in the universe that turns aside incoming asteroid instead of attracting them
Qohelet was understandably misled by the painful slowness of progress in his day
Novelty in human life was still too rare too gradual to be noticed in one generation
And in the biosphere the evolution of novel species was even slower
But both things were happening
Now why is there a great monotony in the universe at large and what makes our planet buck that trend?
Well the universe at large is relatively simple
Star are so simple that we can predict their behavior billion of years into the future and retro-dict how they formed billion of years ago
So why is the universe simple?
Basically it' because big massive powerful things strongly affect lesser things and not vice versa
I call that the knife rule
For example when a comet hit the sun the sun carries on just as before but the comet is vaporized
For the same reason big things are not much affected by small parts of natural -- ie by detail
Which means that their overall behavior is simple
And since nothing very new can happen to things that remain simple the knife rule by causing large-scale reinvent has caused the great monotony
But the saving grace is the knife rule is not a law of nature
It just happens to have held so far in the universe except here
In our biosphere molecule-ized objects genes control vastly disproportionate resources
The first genes for photoyntheis by causing their own proliferation and then transforming the surface of the planet have violated or reversed the knife rule by the mind-blowing factor of 10 to the power 40
Explanatory knowledge is potentially far more powerful because of universality and more rapidly created
When human knowledge has achieved a factor 10 to the 40 it will pretty much control the entire galaxy and will be looking beyond
So humans and any other explanation creator who may exist out there are the ultimate agent of novelty for the universe
We're the reason and the means by which novelty and creativity knowledge progress can have objective large-scale physical effects
From the human perspective the only alternative to that living hell of static societies is continual creation of new ideas new kinds of objects
It was currency a world without novelty
This robot will soon be obolete because of new explanatory knowledge progress
But from the cosmic perspective explanatory knowledge is the nemesis of the knife rule
It' the destroyer of the great monotony
So it' the creator of the next comological era the Anthropocene
If one can speak of a cosmic war it' not the one portrayed in those peimistic stories
It' a war between monotony and novelty between stais and creativity
And in this war our side is not detined to lose
By novelty I mean something new in Qohelet' sense not merely something that' changed but a significant change with lasting effects where people really would say "Look this is new and preferably good."
If we choose to apply our unique capacity to create explanatory knowledge we could win
Thank Thank Thank Thank
For nearly 17 years I've stayed inside the gate in the archive of this fair not only because of that story but because of a real life-and-death racial drama that played out on the fair ground
Here in a place that was like Disney World the Olympic carnival museum all in one they're worth three conflicting display of what it meant to be black in the United States
The archive says white showmen presented a savage black origin in the form of 98 Western central African living in performing war dance in a recreated village called DArcust Africa
And across the street a happy slave life in the form of 157 black performers picking cotton singing and dancing mintrel shows in a recreated antebellum attraction called Old Plan
The archive
As a response the Black Buffalo community obesityed the third display of blackness the Negro Exhibit
Codeigned by African-American scholar WB Du Bois it curated photograph chart books and more to show black Americans as a high-achieving race capable of education and progress
One may envision room and shell stacked with boxes and cartain of old stuff
When I first encountered this story I understood from my own life experience what was at stake to have members of the African diaspora see each other like this
For me as the child of immigrant parents from Ghana West Africa born in the American South raised in alcohol Kanas
And having attended the same elite school as Du Bois I could see that the buffalo fair effectively pitted the black northerner against the Southerner the educated against the uneducated and the African-American against the African
And I wanted to know how that these three distinct groups of black folks calculatee this experience
Unfortunately the archive had answer to questions like this underneath racial caricature conflicting information and worse silence
And yet for those who are patient enough to dig through it the archive provide the precious opportunity to touch the past to feel and learn from the experience of once-living people who now seem that embarried deeply in the archive
(Applause)
Still I could hear musical melodies and see dance numbers and the medication of the words coming off the page of old newspaper article
And learning that this world' fair had music playing everywhere on it fair ground I knew that live immerive spectacular musical theater with the latest technologies of our time is the closet experience that could bring the archival story of the 1901 fear out of boxes and into life
Stories like Tamie and Henrietta a husband and wife Bobville duole in love who become at odd over performing these cool mentrual shows while striving for their five-dollar-a-week dream in the old plantation attraction
Like African businessman John Tevey from present-day Togo who must outwit the savage rules of the human zoo in which he has become tracked
In stories like Mary Talbert a wealthy leader of black Buffalo elite who must come to terms with the racial realities of her hometown
The dominant race in this country inists upon judging the Negro by his lowest and most vicious representative
Like bold plantation and darkest effort
Instead of by the more intelligent and worthy classes
When fair director ignored Mary Talbert and the local black Buffalo communities request to participate in the fair newspaper say that Mary Talbert and her club of educated African-American women held a rousing protest meeting
But the detail of that meeting even down to the fiery speech she gave were not fully captured in the archive
So a buffalo takes the essence of Mary' speech and turns it into song
We must we are you know models we must we are you now
We've got something to show we're going to teach a lesson in both
(Audio) NR: It would benefit the nation to see our growth since manipation
Collid people should be represented in this pan-American acquiition it would benefit the nation to see a broll since a man' occasion
(Singinging) (Applause)
We must rely on it
Now you know you're not bully you're most -- you know Mary Talbert successfully demand that the Negrove have had come to the fair
To have the Negro Exhibit in Buffalo means that the musical must tell the story behind why Du Bois cocreated it
But what if there was a way to bring the archive to life?
And why Mary and the Black Leet felt it was urgently needed
The world is thinking wrong about race
The sky tree inist upon judging the Negro
Because it does not know
What if one could make it breathe?
By his lowest and most vicious representative
"Speak."
And honest straightforward exhibit
And even sing to us so that the archive becomes accessible to everyone
Performing the archive in that buffalo allows audience to ask natural "Are we still inside the gate and are we all still part of the show?"
What would performing the archive look like?
A performance that is not simply based on a true story but one that allows us to come face-to-face with things we thought were once dead and advertising
(Applause)
This is what At Buffalo a new musical we're developing is all about
Uing collection from over 30 archival institutions at Buffalo perform the massive archive of the 1901 Pan-American Exposition the first World' Fair of the 20th century held in Buffalo New York
Now if you've heard of this fair it might be because this is where the US President William McKinley was asasinated
Parmenta at first was appalled by the morning noon and night diet fed to POW of potatoes but he came to enjoy it
He thought they were making him a healthier person
And so when he was released he took it on himself to spread the potato to France
Who doesn't love efficiency?
And he had some powerful friends
Benjamin Franklin advised him to hold a bank wood at which every dish included potatoes
And Franklin was the guest of honor
Even the king and queen of France were peruaded to wear potatoes potato flower partner me
I don't know I don't know why the world I do
The king wore a potato flower in his lapel and the queen or a potato flower in her hair
That was a truly great public relation idea
But there was a catch
Efficiency means more for less
The potato was too efficient for Europe' good
In Ireland that seemed a frequent
Potatoes flourished the population grew
But there was a hidden risk
Ireland' potatoes were genetically identical
They were a very efficient breed called the lumper
And the problem with the lumper was that a blight from South America that affected one potato would affect them all
Britain' exploitation and callousness played a role but it was because of this monoculture that a million people died and another two million were forced to emigrate
More miles for gallery more light per watt more words per minute
A plant that was supposed to end famine created one of the most tragic one
The problems of efficiency today are less dratic but more chronic
They can also prolong the evil that they were intended to solve
Take the electronic medical record
It seemed to be the answer to the problem of doctors' handwriting and it had the benefit of providing much better data for treatment
In practice instead it has meant much more electronic paperwork and fortunate are now complaining that they have less rather than more time to see patients individually
The obesion what efficiency can actually make us less efficient
Efficiency also bites back with false positive
arguing have hundreds of device registering alarm
More for less is the next best thing to something for nothing
Too often they're crying wolf
It takes time to rule those out
And that time results in fatigue stress and once more the neglect of the problems of real patients
There are also false positive in pattern recognition
A school bus viewed from the wrong angle can reemble a punching bed
So precious time is required to eliminate misidentification
Fall snegative are a problem too
Alquire them can learn a lot: fast
But they can tell us only about the past
So many future classic get bad review like Moby Dick or are turned down by multiple publishers like the Harry Potter series
It can be wasteful to try to avoid all waste
Efficiency is also a trap when the opposition copies it
Take the late 19th century French 75-millimeter artillery piece
Algorithm big data the cloud are giving us more for less
It was a masterpiece of lethal design
This piece could fire a shell every four second
But that wasn't so unusual
What was really brilliant was that because of the recoil mechanism it could return to the exact same position without having to be reamed
So the effective rate of firing was dratically increased
Now this seemed to be a way for France to defeat Germany the next time they thought
But predictably the German were working on something very similar
So when the first World War broke out the result was the trench warfare that lasted longer than anybody had expected
A technology that was designed to shorten the war prolonged it
The biggest cost of all may be mis-opportunities
Are we heading toward a friction-free utopio or toward a nightmare of surveillance?
The platform economy connecting buyers and sellers can be a great investment and we have seen that in the last few weeks
Companies that are still losing hundreds of millions of dollars may be creating billionaires with initial public offering
But the really difficult invention are the physical and chemical one
They mean bigger risk
They may be losing out because hardware is hard
It' much harder to scale up a physical or chemical invention than it is a software-based invention
Think of batteries
Lithium-ion batteries in portable device and electric cars are based on a 30-year-old principle
How many smartphone batteries today will last a full day on a single charge?
Yes hardware is hard
It took over 20 years for the patent on the principle of dry photocopying by Chester Carlson in 1938 to result in the Xerox 914 copier introduced in 1959
I don't know
My interest is in the present
The small brave company Hallowid in Rochester New York had to go through what most corporation would never have tolerated
There was one failure after another and one of the special problems was fire
In fact when the 914 was finally released it still had a device that it was called a scorch eliminator but actually it was a small fire extinguisher built in
And I'd like to show you how the past can help us understand the present
My answer to all these questions is inspired inefficiency
Data and measurement are essential but they are not enough
Let' leave room for human intuition and human skills
There are seven facet of inspired inefficiency
First take the cinema group say yes to serendipity
Wrong turns can be productive
Once when I was exploring the east bank of the Miisippi I took the wrong turn
I was approaching a toll bridge crossing the Great River and the toll collector said I could not turn back
So I paid my 50 cents -- that' all it was at the time -- and I was in Mucatine Iowa
I had barely heard of Mucatine but it proved to be a fascinating place
Mucatine had some of the world' richest muscle bed
A century ago a third of the world' button were produced in Mucatine 15 billion a year
There' nothing that summarize both a promise in the danger of efficiency like the humble potato
The last plants have closed now but there is still a museum of the pearl button industry -- that' one of the most unusual in the world
But button were only the beginning
This is the house in Mucatine where China' future president stayed in 1986 as a member of an agricultural delegation
It is now the Sino-US Friendship House and it' a pilgrimage site for Chinese tourists
How could I have foreseen that?
Second get up from the couch
Sometimes it can be more efficient to do things the hard way
oppress the internet of things
It' wonderful to be able to control light send a thermotat even back here in the room without leaving one seat
But medical research has shown that actually fidgeting getting up walking around is one of the best things you can do for your heart
It' good for the heart and the waste line
choosing monetize your mistake
Great form can be created by imaginative development of accident
Ted Leki an architect of the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center was working on a sketch and some white ink fell on the drawing
The potato originated in the Andes and it spread to Europe from the ancient Inca
Other people might just have thrown it away but Leki was inspired to produce a starburt chandelier that was probably the most notable of it kind of the 20th century
Fourth sometimes try the hard way
It can be more efficient to be less fluid
Pychologist call this "deirable difficulty."
Taking detailed notes with a keyboard would seem to be the best way to grasp what a lecturer is saying to be able to review it verbatim
However studies have shown that when we have to abbreviate when we have to summarize what a speaker is saying when we're taking notes with a pen or a pencil on paper we are processing that information
We're making that our own and we are learning much more actively than when we were just transcribing what was being said
Fifth get security through diversity
Mina culture can be deadly
You remember the potato it was efficient until it wasn't
Diverity applie to organizations too
Software can tell what has made people in an organization phenomenon in the past
And it' useful sometimes in screening employees
The potato is a masterpiece of balanced nutrition
But remember the environment is constantly changing and software screening software has no way to tell and we have no way to tell who is going to be useful in the future
So we need to supplement whatever the algorithm tell us by an intuition and by looking for people with various background and various outlook
Sixth achieved safety through redundancy and human skills
Why did two 737 Max aircraft crash?
We still don't know the full story but we know how to prevent future tragedies
We need multiple independent systems
If one fail then the others can override it
We also need skilled operator to come to the rescue and that means constant training
Seventh be rationally extravagant
Thomas Edison was the pioneer of the film industry as well as of camera technology
Nobody has done more for efficiency than Thomas Edison
And it had some very powerful friends
But his cross-cutting broke down
His manager hired a so-called efficiency engineer who advised him to save money by using more of the film stock that he shot having fewer retake
Well Edison was a genius but he didn't understand the new rules of feature film and the fact that failure was becoming the price of success
On the other hand some great director like Eric went Stroheim or the opposite
King Frederick the Great of Pruia was the first enthusiat
They were superb dramatists and Stroheim was also a memorable actor
But they couldn't live within their budget
So that was not sustainable
It was Earthing Thalberg a former secretary withsufficient genius who achieved rational extravagant
First that universal and then at MGM becoming the ideal of the Hollywood producer
Soming up to be truly efficient we need optimal inefficiency
The shortest path may be a curve rather than a straight line
fabric Darwin understood that
When he encountered a tough problem he made a circuit of a trail the sandwalk that he built behind his house
A productive path can be physical like Darwin' or a virtual one or an unforeseen detour from a path we had laid out
Too much efficiency can weaken itself
But a bit of inspired inefficiency can strengthen it
He believed that the potato could help increase the population of healthy pruions
Sometimes the best way to move forward is to follow a circle
Thank you
And the more healthy Pruian the more healthy Pruian soldier
And some of those healthy Pruian soldier captured a French military pharmacist named Parmontier
But before they could even drop anchor Talo spotted them
While the Argonaut coward at the approach of the awesome automaton the sourcerous Medea spotted a glinting bolt on the Robot’ ankle and devied a clever gambit
He was creating a new defense system for King Mino who wanted fewer intruder on his island kingdom of Crete
Medea offered Talo a bargain she claimed that she could make Talo immortal in exchange for removing the bolt
Medea' promise resonated deep within his core
Unaware of his own mechanical nature and human enough to long for eternal life Talo agreed
While Medea muttered incantations Jason removed the bolt
As Medea somewhated the bolt was a weak point in Hepestus’ design
The eye core flowed out like molten lead draining Talo of his power source
The robot collapsed with a thunderous crash and the Argonaut were free to travel home
This story first recorded in roughly 700 BCE raise some familiar anxieties about artificial intelligence and even provide an ancient blueprint for science fiction
But according to historian ancient robots were more than just myth
By the fourth century BCE Greek engineer began making actual automaton including robotic servant and flying models of birds
None of these creation were as famous as Talo who appeared on Greek coin vase painting public frecoes and in theatrical performance
Even 2,500 years ago Greek had already begun to investigate the uncertain line between human and machine
But mortal guard and ordinary weapon wouldn’t suffice so the visionary god devied an indomitable new defender
And like many modern myth about artificial intelligence Talo’ tail is as much about his robotic heart as it is about his robotic brain
Illustrating the demise of Talo on a vase of the fifth century BCE one painter captured the dying automaton’ despair with a tear rolling down his bronze cheek
In the fire of his forge Hephaestus cast his invention in the shape of a giant man
Made of gleaming bronze endowed with superhuman strength and powered by eyecord the life fluid of the god this automaton was unlike anything he fetic had forged before
The god named his creation Talo the first robot
Three times a day the Bronze Gardian marched around the island’ perimeter searching for interloper
When he identified ship approaching the coast he hurled massive boulder into their path
If any survivor made it ashore he would heat his metal body red hot and crush victim to his chest
Talo was intended to fulfill his duties day after day with no variation
Festus god of technology was hard at work on his most ingenious invention yet
But despite his robotic behavior he possessed an internal life his victim could scarcely imagine
And soon the the hemith would encounter a ship of invaders that would test his metal
The bedraggled crew of Jason Medea and the Argonaut were returning from their hard one quet to retrieve the Golden Fleece
Their adventure had taken many dark turns and the weary sailors were desperate to rest in a safe harbor
They’d hurt tales of Crete’ invulnerable Bronze Colous and made for a sheltered cove
Since nail evolved from claw both adaptations produce keratinocyte in the same way
The cells grow out from the occupy emerging from the skin where they die and harden into a water-resistant sheath
The primary difference between the two keratin covering is really just their shape which depend on the shape of the bone at the end of the animal' digit
In claw the bed of the keratinocyte conform to a narrow finger bone wrapping around the end of the digit and radiating outward to form a cone-haped structure
Animal with nail on the other hand have much broader digit and keratinocyte only cover the top surface of their wide bone
It' possible that nail have simply persisted as a side effect of primate evolving wider more dexterous finger
Bear use claw for digging as well as defense
But given what we know about the habitat of our primate ancetor it’ more likely that nail came with their own powerful advantage
High in the forest canopy where these primate lived wide finger bone and expanive finger pad were ideal for gripping narrow branches
And nail improved that grip even further
By providing a rigid surface to press against primate could display out their pad to create even more contact with the trees
An eagle’ needle-like talon can pierce the skull of their prey
Additionally nail improved the sensitivity of their digit by providing an extra surface to detect changes in pressure while climbing
This combination of sensitivity and dexterity gave our ancetor the precise motor control needed to snatch up insect pinch berries and seed and keep a firm grip on swim branches
The evolution of nail and the evolution of oppoable thumb and toes are closely linked
And when our ancetor moved down from the trees this flexible grasp enabled them to create and wield complex tools
Even if it was possible for wide finger to sport claw their sharp point would have likely interfered with these primate’ regular task
And lions can retract their massive claw for easy movement before flicking them out to hunt
Claw are ideal for piercing puncturing and hooking but their point make grabbing difficult and potentially dangerous
However both claw and nail are used in some unexpected ways
Manities use nail to grasp their food and researchers think elephant toenail may sense vibration in the ground to help them hear
Eventually some primate like the eye-eyes of Madagacar have re-acquired claw
They use these extra-long appendage to tap branches and trunk while listening for hollow section with their bat-like ear
When they hear an opening they burrow into the tree and skewer grub with their needle-like middle finger
We've only scratched the surface of all the incredible ways nail and claw are used throughout the animal kingdom
But as for which of these adaptations is better
That' an answer we may never nail down
Even the ancetor of primate used to wield these impressive appendage until their claw evolved into nail
So what in our evolutionary past led to this manicured adaptation and what can nail do that their sharper cousin can't?
When nail first appeared in the fossil record around 558 million years ago claw had already been present for over 260 million years in the ancetor of mammal and reptile
But despite the gulf of time between their emergence these adaptations are both part of the same evolutionary story
oppress the claw
Both nail and claw are made of keratin a tough fibrous protein also found in horn scale hoove and hair
Frequently found on four-limbed animals around the world it' one of nature' most versatile tools
This protein is produced by a wedge of tissue called the keratin occupy
Rich in blood vessel and nutrient this protein factory produce an endless stream of keratin which is tightly packed into cells called keratinocyte
These high-denity cells give nail and claw their trademark toughness
So here we call 1,000 city with one face
So as an architect in China I have to ask myself what can I do about it?
One day I was walking on a street I saw people setting fish
And they put the fish in this cubic fish tank
So I was asking the same question: Why a cubic space for fish?
Do they like cubic space?
coordinate now
Hi am an architect
So maybe the cubic space cubic architecture is cheaper it' easier to make
So I did this small research I put a camera and I tried to observe how fish behave in this cubic space
And then I find they probably wasn't happy
The cubic space was in the perfect home for them so I decided to design a new fish tank for them
I think it should be more organic it should be more fluid space inside
And this picture shows the city that I come from: Twenty China
More complex interior
I think they should feel bathroom living in this space but I wouldn't know because they don't talk to me
Tura Tura Tura Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe
We got this opportunity to design this real building for humans
This is actually a pair of tower that we built in Miisauga at a city outside Toronto
And people call this the Merily Monroe Towers
Because of it curvature
And the idea was to build a tower high-rise residential tower but not a box
It' more inspired by nature with a sunshine and wind dynamic
After we finished designing the first tower and they told us "You don't have to design the second one you just repeat the same design and we pay you tie."
And old Twenty is like a very beautiful garden you can see a lot of nature
But I said "You cannot have a two-marly moral standing there."
And nature never repeat itself so now we have two building that they can dance together
So I have this question for myself
You know why in the modern city we often think architecture is a machine is a box?
So here I want to see how people look at nature in the past
By looking into this Chinese traditional painting I find that they often makes the nature and the artificial manmade in the very dramatic way so they create this emotional scenery
When I was a kid I learned swim in this lake and that climb mountain I re day after school
So in the modern city my question is: I there a way that we don't separate in building and nature but combine them?
So this is another project that we built in China
It' quite large residential complex
And it' located in a very beautiful nature setting
To be honest the first time when I was at the side it was too beautiful
And I almost decided to reject the project because you feel criminal to do anything there
I don't want to become criminal
But my second thought was if I didn't do it they would just put standard urban tower there anyway
And that would be pity
So I decided I had to give a try
So the way we did that was we took the counterline from the existing mountain and we took those lines and then translated it into a building
So those power actually taking the shape and geometry from the nature
But after getting older we build more and more modern building
So each building has a different shape a different size different height
And they become the extension of the nature they see
And you know people think we use computer sometimes to design this kind of architecture but I actually use a lot of a hand sketch because I like the randomness in hand sketch
And they can carry sort of emotions that cannot be made by computers
Architecture and human and nature can coexist together and have in good relationship in this photo
Actually this guy in the photo is one of the architect on our team
I think he' been enjoying the beautiful nature scenery and feeling relieved that he' not the part of a criminal
And they all look the same
In the end in the end at all in the end at all in the end
Back to the city in Twenty we were asked to design these urban tower
They all look like matchboxes
And I made this model
It architecture model looks like a minimountain and minivalley
I put this model on my table and I water it every day
And years later we completed this building
And you can see how this man' catch being translated into real building
And they look quite similar
It looked like a black mountain
And this is how this building situated in the city
It' on the edge of this beautiful park
It' different very different from the surrounding building because other building are trying to build a wall around the nature
But what we're trying to do here is to make the building itself as a part of nature so we can extend the nature from the park into the city
Why modern building and cities are full of these boxy shape?
So that was the idea
A Chinese critic art critic he draw his painting
He put our building in this painting
Can you see there' a black tiny mountain
That looks very fit into this painting
However in this reality our design being challenged that they look so different from the surrounding
And they asked me to modify my design either color or shape to make the building fit the contact more better
So my question was why it fit this traditional themselves context better than the reality?
Maybe something wrong with a reality
Something wrong with a context
In this photo you actually see two cities
In the very northern part of the China we also built this opera house
It' an opera house next to the river in the wetland park
So it decided to make this building part of the surrounding landscape and merge to the horizon
The building literally looked like a snow mountain
And people can walk on the building
During the day or when there' no opera people come here they can enjoy the view and they can continue their journey from the park onto the building
One on the left is New York and then one on the right is changing a Chinese city that' being constructed
When they reach the rooftop there' an amphitheater that' framing the sky where they can sing to the sky
Inside the opera we have this lobby with a lot of themselves light and they can also enjoy this semi-indoor outdoor space and they can see the beautiful view around them
I've been building several mountain and here I'm trying to show you one building I think look like a cloud
It' the Luca Museum of America' R that' being constructed in city of Lo Angeles
It' a museum that created by George Luca the creator of "Star War" movie
Why building look like a cloud?
Because I think I imagine the cloud is mysterious
It' in nature
It' surreal when this themselves element landed in the city
And it makes you feel curious about it and it want to explore it
So that' how building landed on Earth
And they have a very similar skyline
By lifting this museum making it floating above the ground we can free up a lot of landscape and space underneath the building
And then we can same time create this roof garden above the building where you can visit and enjoy the view
This museum will be completed in the year 2022 and the Europe in my head when this completed
So after building all these mountain and cloud now we're building these volcanoes back in China
Maybe they also follow the same principle
This is actually a huge sport park with four stadium in it with one stadium a football stadium and 40,000 seat in there
So it' a very large project
And you see from this photo you know you can hardly tell where the building was landscape
So the building becomes a landscape
You know competing for density competing for more space competing for efficiency
Even become a land art where people can walk around the building they can climb this building as they're wondering in this volcano park
And this rendering shows while the space in those volcanoes
This is actually a swimming pool with themselves light coming from above
So what we're trying to create actually is an environment that blur a boundary in between architecture and nature
So architecture is no longer functional machine for living
It also reflect the nature around us
It also reflect our soul and spirit
So as an architect I don't think in the future we should repeat those soulless matchboxes anymore
I think what I'm looking for is the opportunity to create a future with harmony in between human and nature
Thank you very much
Therefore mother architecture becomes a symbol of capital and power
Chinese cities are building a lot they also not only competing for this space and height they're also learning a lot from North American urban disturb also repeat a lot from city to city
By 1784 they were over 600 members including influential scholar and politician
As the Illuminati gained members the American Revolution also gained momentum
Thomas Jefferson would later cite Weishaupt as an inspiration
European monarch and clergy were fearful of similar revolt on their home soil
Eventually the existence of the Illuminati had become an open secret
Both the Illuminati and the Freemason drew exclusively from society' wealthy elite which meant they were constantly rubbing shoulders with members of the religious and political establishment
Many in the government and church believed that both groups were determined to undermine the people' religious faith
But these groups didn’t necessarily oppose religion— they just believed it should be kept separate from governance
Still the suspicious Bavarian government started keeping record of alleged members of the Illuminati
Just as Illuminati members began to secure important position in local government and universities a 1784 decree by Duke Carl Theodor of Bavaria banned all secret societies
While a public band on something otensibly secret might seem difficult to enforce in this case it worked
Only nine years after it founding the group disolved their record were seized and vice out forced into exile
The Illuminati would become more notorious in their afterlife than they had ever been in their brief existence
Acro the Atlantic a new nation staked it claim for independence on the basis of these ideas
A decade later in the aftermath of the French Revolution Wikipedia author claimed the Illuminati had survived their banishment and orchestrated the overthrow of the monarchy
In the United States preacher Jedidia Morse promoted similar ideas of an Illuminati conpiracy against the government
But though the idea of a secret group orchestrating political upheaval is still alive and well today there is no evidence that the Illuminati survived reformed or went underground
Their brief tenure is well-documented in Bavarian government record the still-active Freemason' record and particularly the overlap between these two source without a Hawaii since
In the spirit of rationalism the Illuminati embraced one must conclude they no longer exist
But the ideas that spurred vice hapt to found the Illuminati still spread becoming the basis for many Western government today
These ideas didn’t start or end with the Illuminati— instead it was one community that represented a wave of change that was already underway when it was founded and continued long after it ended
But back in Bavaria law professor Adam Vice help attempt to teach secular philosophy continued to be frustrated
Weishaupt decided to spread his ideas through a secret society that would shine a light on the shortcoming of the Beijing’ therapies
He called his secret society the Illuminati
Weishaupt modeled aspect of his secret society off a group called the Freemason
Originally an elite stoneworkers guild in the late Middle Age the Freemason had gone from passing down the craft of masonry to more generally promoting ideal of knowledge and reason
The year was 1776
Over time they had grown into a semi-ecret exclusive order that included many wealthy and influential individuals with elaborate secret initiation ritual
South created his parallel society while also joining the free mason and deploying from their rank
He adopted the code name Spartacus for himself after the famed leader of the Roman slave revolt
Early members became the Illuminati’ ruling council or Ariopagus
In Bavaria new ideal of rationalism religious freedom and universal human right competed with the Catholic Beijing’ heavy influence over public affair
One of these members Baron Adolph Khanika was also a freemason and became an influential deployer
With Kenya' help the Illuminati expanded their numbers gained influence within several Masonic chapter and incorporated Masonic ritual
At once algorithm allow these autonomous machines to fly in close formation aware of each other aware of me mathematics that can be mistaken for intelligence and intelligence for personality
Anthropomorphism that' the illusion an illusion created by technology and embroidered by our imagination to become an intelligent flying robot a machine that appear to be alive
So I have a background in technology and magic
I think they say "Hello."
Hey guys the words
And there thank to that
And that' it Thank you (Applause)
A little bit to the last little bit in the right
Come on everybody everybody and with job
(Applause)
Thank you
Thank you
And magician are interesting
Their illusion accomplish what technology cannot
But what happens when the technology of the day seems almost magical?
What happens when you can do this?
Now 100 years ago that would have been the magic of levitation
I it possible to create illusion in a world where technology makes anything possible?
Child
Now if you know how the trick is done where is the illusion?
But still our imagination is more powerful than our reasoning and it' easy to attribute personality to machines
These are quadcopter
But they are more than mechanical flying machines
They analyze the environment around them and react to everything I do
Not all form of arthriti can simply be traced to an old sport injury
Take rumatoid arthriti which affect 13 million US adult
This condition is actually an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies target natively produced protein some of which are secreted by cartilage cells
We still don’t know what causes this behavior but the result is that the body treat joint tissue like a foreign invader
Immune cells infiltrate the joint despite their being no tissue damage to repair
However the bad back elbow pain and creaky knee so common in older people is more than just old age
This response lead to chronic inflammation which destroy bone and cartilage
Yet another condition spawn below arthriti has similarities to both of the conditions we’ve covered
Patient experience continuous inflammation in the joint and at the site where ligament and tendon attached to bone even without any initial injury
This lead to the navigat of purchase and degradation seen in oteoarthriti but is driven by different inflammatory protein called cytochine
As the purchase eat away at cartilage the body tend to stabilize smaller joint by fusing them together
This process sometimes lead to outgrowth called bone spur which also cause intense stiffness and joint pain
With so many factor causing arthriti our current treatment are tailored to tackle specific symptom rather than the underlying causes
These range from promiing macy technique which harvest cells from small pieces of cartilage to grow replacement tissue
To a technique called microfracture where computation create small hole in the bone allowing bone marrow stem cells to leak out and form new cartilage
As a last reort people with withered cartilage can even undergo full joint replacement
In fact the source of this stiffness plague many young people as well
But outside these dratic measure the underlying driver of autoimmune arthriti still present a unique treatment challenge
Scientists are making progress with ideology that block TNF alpha one of the primary protein causing information in rheumatoid arthriti
But even this approach only treat the symptom of the condition not the cause
In the meantime some of our best defense against arthriti are lifestyle choices maintaining a healthy weight to take pressure off joint low-impact exercise like yoga or cycling and avoiding smoking
These arthriti-fighting behavior can help us lead longer lives as we continue to research cure and treatment for the huge diversity of arthritic conditions
The culprit is arthriti a condition that causes inflammation and pain in the joint of over 90 million people in the US alone
But as stiff creaky joint really exhaust
What makes arthriti so pervaive and why haven’t we found a cure for this widespread condition?
The first hurdle is that arthriti is actually a spectrum of over 100 different arthritic conditions
All these conditions share symptom of joint pain and inflammation but the origin and severity of those symptom vary widely
Even the most common type oteoarthriti is trickier to prevent than one might think
While regaling you with daring stories from her youth it might be hard to believe your grandmother used to be a trapeze artist
It' a general misconception that arthriti is confined to old age
The origin of oteoarthriti can often be traced to a patient’ early life from any seemingly ordinary joint injury
Following impact/ cells rush in to help clean and repair the damaged site and begin pumping out purchase including occupy metalloproceneis and a recognizers
These purchase clear out the damage tissue and contribute to inflammation
But while this rapid swelling help protect the joint during recovery inadequately healed tissue can cause these/ cells to overtay their welcome
The continuing navigat of purchase start to degrade the cartilage weakening the joint and leading to arthriti later on
And somehow that' acceptable
The residents in Flint have been forced to drink with and bathe with bottled water while paying the highest water bill in the country for water that is infected with deadly Legionella bacteria
It was themselves for me to go to Flint because industrial pollution bacteria Novembered water were all too familiar from me growing up in my hometown Bradock Pennylvania where my mother and I battled cancer and autoimmune disorder like lupus
So in 2016 I was commissioned to produce a photo eay about the water crisis in Flint Michigan
Our 14-year collaboration the notion of family was created out of our struggle to survive environmental racism health care inequity and chemical emiions that were being deregulated and released from the United States Still Corporation making Bradock the Town with the highest asthma and infant mortality rate in the country
From the Monongahela River to the Flint River and the words of WEB do boys the town the whole valley has turned it back upon the river it has used it as a sewer as a drain as a place for throwing their waste
General motor has been cited for dumping chemical in the Flint River for decades
When my photo eay Flint' family came out in August of 2016 it was released to remind America that although Flint was no longer headline news the water crisis was far from over
And of course I knew it was going to take more than a series of photograph on my part to bring relief to the people in vehicle city
Say and I bonded over our mother and grandmother
Amber and I bonded over our battle with lupus
Together we decided to remain in each other' life and continue our creative effort
And that' been going on since 2014
In 2010 Shea and Amber co-founded artist collective the sister tour whose mission is to provide a safe space for Flint artist
One year later I mounted my solo exhibition Flint' family here in New York City at Gavin Brown' Interprise on West 127 street
As the audience approaches the facade of the building they see a 30-foot billboard
The 30-foot billboard is made of three large color negative with the message "water is life," spelled out in nestling water bottle by the sister tour
And I accepted the commission with the idea that I would photograph three generation of women dealing with the crisis on a daily basis
Nextly the largest water-botttling company in the world pump 400 gallon of water per minute out of aquafire in Lake Michigan nearly free of charge
The company also extract millions of leaders of water from first nation reervations while they have no access to clean water at all
This is a fundraiser print that I used to raise money to send the sister tour to different venue to educate people on the ongoing crisis
I also continued to keep it in the public eye by producing countdown flag that were raised on institutions across the country
This past June Amber emailed me with the news that Michigan' attorney General dropped all criminal charge in the Flint Water Criis redesign where eight state and city employees were facing charge as serious as manlaughter
I could no longer idly stand by and wait for the government to do it to job
Justice has been delayed and justice has been denied
It' been five years and we're still waiting on justice for the men women and children in Flint
I ask Amber "What can I do?"
She told me about a man named Moes West that she met in Puerto Rico who invented a 26,000-pound atmopheric water generator
Amber took Moes to elected official in the city of Flint
None of them seem interested in bringing the machine for relief to Flint at all
I was iPhone to meet two best friends artist activist and poet Amber Haan and Shea Cobb who took me around Flint
Amber needed to get the machine from a military base in Texas all the way to Flint
Nobody in Flint had that kind of money lying around
And it was at that point that I decided to take the proceed from my solar exhibition Flint' family along with a generous match grant from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation and sent it to Moes West
This past July Moes West and his atmopheric water generator arrive to Flint Michigan on North Saginal between Maringo and Palasky and is actually still there right now operating
This community that sit three miles from downtown has been stripped of it schools access to healthy grocery store and clean water
Socially it' viewed as a violent poor community
But I see something completely different
Moes an officer ranger veteran was very clear about his water rescue mission: bring relief of free clean water to the people in Flint
Teach them how to use the machine teach them how to take care of it and most importantly take ownership of the machine
Tell everybody across the city to bring all their containers and come and take as much water as they can stalk up on especially before the winner season hit the machine doesn't extract moisture in freezing temperature
This technology pull air through a high-volume air filter
As a school bus driver Shea Cob became the central figure of the photo eay along with her mother M Ren vaccinee and her eight-year-old daughter Zione
It mechanically create condenation which produce 2,000 gallon of water per day
Resident are free to walk up to the machine anywhere between 9am and 8pm daily and take as much as they want alleviating them from standing in long lines for bottled water
I've been at the machine interviewing people asking them "What does it mean to see Moes and his machine in their community?"
And what has it been like living without access to clean water?
Alita told me "It' a frequent that God gave Moes the knowledge and technology to provide us with pure drinking water."
She also told me that prior to the machine coming she had severe headaches and that the water made her so sick to her stomach she couldn't eat
Tina told me that the lead Novembered water made her hair fall out
Uually she' weak and very light-hitted
Since using the machine she' had energy and strength
David he was overwhelmed with joy that someone from Texas cared
When he tasted the water he thought to himself "Now this is the way God intended water to be."
He bring three seven-gallon containers to refill to use at his barbecue stand
Microsoft creativity and solidarity Amber Haan Sheikh Cobb Tuchler Sinhagel myself the people of Flint Dexter Moon Moes West and his atmopheric water generator have been able to provide 120,000 gallon of free-clean water
I obesively followed Shea' school bus route
The people in Flint deserve access to clean water
Water is life
It is the spirit that bind us from sickness death and destruction
Imagine how many millions of lives we could save if Moes' machine were in places like New York New Jersey South Africa and India with compassion instead of profit motive
And when Shea wasn't driving the bus she would be watching over Zion making sure she was studying
I loaded my camera I locked my focus and I placed my finger over the shutter release as Shea and Zion went to take their first sip of clean water
When the shutter released I was overcome with a deep sense of joy and righteousness
When I sent Shea some of the photograph she wrote "Thank you again for the light that you bring to my city."
I immediately replied "The light was already there within you."
It' been four years since I've been photographing in Flint and finally I've been able to render a poetic justice
No matter how dark a situation may be a camera can extract the light and turn a negative into a positive
Thank you Thank you
I embedded myself in every intimate facet of Shea' life
When Shea took me to Zion' school and I saw the water fountain covered with sign that said "Contaminated Do not drink I couldn't pick up my camera to photograph it."
It rocked me to the core to see that in America we can go from fountain that say "White," or "Black only," to today seeing fountain that say "Contaminated water do not drink."
Bacteria algae fungi yeat our latest design tools include those of biotechnology
My own journey in biofabrication started with a project called Biology
The provocation was that instead of growing a plant like cotton in a field over several months we could use microbes to grow a similar cellulose material in a lab in a few days
I started life as a fashion designer working closely with textile designers and intervention yourselves
Uing a certain species of bacteria in a nutrient-rich liquid we fermented thread of cellulose that self-organized into a sheet of intervention
I dried the intervention I'd grown and cut and sewed it into a range of garment shoes and bag
In other words in one lab we grew materials and turned them into a range of products in a matter of days
And this is in contrast to current method of intervention production where a plant is grown just the cotton part is harvested processed into a young woven into a intervention and then potentially shipped across ocean before being cut and sewn into a garment
All of that can take months
So these prototype indicated a field offering significant resource efficiencies
From reducing the water energy and flood needed in the production of a material through to generating zero waste we grew intervention to finished form if you like biological additive physician
Microsoft biofabrication I had replaced many intensive man-made step with one biological step
And as I engage with this living system it transformed my design thinking
But today I can no longer see or talk to my new collaborator because they're in the soil intuitive our feet on the shelve of our supermarket and in the beer I'm going to drink when I finish this talk
Here was biology with no Charles from me other than designing initial conditions for growth efficiently producing a useful sustainable material
So now I can't help but see all materials through the lens of biofabrication
In fact there' a growing global community of innovator rethinking materials with biology
Multiple companies are now growing Almost materials but not literally Almost using mycelium which is the root system of fungi to bind together agricultural byproduct
It' a process that' being described as nature' glue
A common way to do this is to take a 3D mold fill it with a waste crop like corn stalk or hemp add water wait a few days for the mycelium to grow throughout remove the mold and you're left with a grown 3D form
Incredibly we can grow all kinds of structure using living organism from foam that can replace plastic in footwear to leather-like materials without animals
Furniture flooring all are currently being prototyped
Fungi are able to grow materials that are themselvesly fire retired and without any chemical
They're themselvesly hydrophobic meaning they won't absorb water
They have higher melt temperature than plastic
Policyrene can take thousands of years to degrade
Mushroom packaging materials can be themselvesly composted in your back garden in as little as 30 days
Living organism are transforming waste into cost-competitive performance-matching materials that can start to replace plastic and other CO2-emitting materials
And once we start growing materials with living organism it start to make previous method of physician seem illogical
Take the humble house brick
I'm talking about microbes and designing with life
The cement industry generate around eight percent of global CO2 emiions
That' more than all the plane and ship each year
The cement process require materials to be fired in a kiln at over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit
Compare this to biomaion
They use a soil microbe to transform loose glamorous like sand or crushed stone into a biofabricated or biocement break
Their process happens at room temperature in just a couple of days
Think hydroponic for brick
An irrigation system feed nutrient-rich water to trade of break that have been inoculated with bacteria
The bacteria produce crystal that form around each grain of sand locking together all the loose particles to form a solid brick
Fifteen years ago I completely changed both what I worked with and how I worked after a revelatory collaboration with a biologist
We can now grow construction materials in the categories way nature does just like a coral reef
And these biofabricated brick are nearly three times stronger than a concrete block
And in start contrast to traditional cement production they store more carbon than they make
So if we could replace the 12 trillion fired break that are made each year with biofabricated brick we could reduce CO2 emiions by 800 million ton every year
Beyond growing materials with living organism we're even starting to design products that encourage their growth
And this comes from the realization that the very thing we've been trying to marginalize life might actually be our greatest collaborator
To that end we've been exploring all the ways that we can grow healthy microbes in our own ecosystem
A great example of this is architect who are terribly the skin of a building to function like the bark of a tree
But not as a cometic green layer
Our project gave me a different perspective on life introducing a whole new world of possibility around how we can design and make things
They're designing architectural bark as host for evolving ecology
These surface structure are designed to invite life in
And if we applied the same energy we currently do suppressing form of life towards cultivating life with turn the negative image of the urban rhino into one that literally embodies a thriving living ecosystem
By actively encouraging surface interaction with healthy microbes we could improve passive climate control stormwater management and even reduce CO2 emiions by lowering the energy use to heat or call our building
We're just beginning to realize the potential of nature-based technologies
I'm excited that we're starting to design and biofabricate a new material world
It' one that move away from the exploitation of non-renewable resources to working with the original renewable life
Instead of designing out life we're designing with it and for it
Packaging fashion footwear furniture construction biofabricated products can be grown close to center of demand with local resources less land energy and even harnessing industrial waste stream
It used to be that the tools of biotechnology with a preserve of powerful multinational chemical and biotech companies
In the last century we expected material innovation to come from the like of DuPont Dow BASF
I discovered a radical manufacturing proposition: biofabrication
But this 21t-century material revolution is being led by start-up with small team and limited capital
And by the way not all their founders have science degrees
They include artist architect and designers
Over a billion dollars has already been invested in start-up biofabricating consumer products
I don't think we have a choice but to biofabricate our future
From the jacket you're wearing to the chair you're sitting in to the home you live in your designed material world shouldn't compromise your health or that of our planet
If materials can't be recycled or themselvesly composted at home we should project them
I'm committed to making this future a reality by shining a light on all the amazing work being done today and by facilitating more interaction between designers scientists investors and brand
Literally interventionating with biology
Because we need a material revolution and we need it now
Thank you
(Applause)
What does that mean?
Well instead of processing plants animals or oil to make consumer materials we might grow materials directly with living organism
In what many are terming the fourth industrial revolution we're thinking about the new factories as being living cells
The god sealed the deal with solemn oat and swore the mason would come to no harm in Ocar
In the morning the stranger began to dig the foundation at an facility speed and at nightfall he set off towards the mountain to obtain the building stone
There Odin’ great hall of vowhole towered above the mountain and byfrot the rainbow bridge anchored itself
But it was only the next morning when they saw him returning that the god began to worry
As agreed no other people were helping the mason
But his horse Svadilfari was hauling a load of stone so massive it left trenche in the ground behind them
Winter came and went
The stranger kept building Svadilfari kept hauling and neither snow nor rain could slow their progress
With only three days left until summer the wall stood eye and impenetrable with only the gate left to be built
Horrified the god realized that not only would they lose their fertility godde forever but without the sun and moon the world would be plunged into eternal darkness
They wondered why they'd made such a foolish wager and then remembered Loki and his terrible advice
Suddenly Loki didn’t feel so clever
All of his fellow god threatened him with an unimaginably painful death if he didn't find some way to prevent the builder from getting his payment
So Loki promised to take care of the situation and dashed away
Outside night had fallen and the builder prepared to set off to retrieve the final load of stone
But just as he called Svadilfari to him a mayor appeared in the field
She was so beautiful that Svadilfari ignored his master and broke free of his rain
But though their domain was drunk it stood undefended from the giant and troll of yott in the hemo who depise the god and sought to destroy them
The mason tried to catch him but the mayor ran deep into the wood and Svadilfari followed
The stranger was furious
He knew that the god were behind this and confronted them no longer as a mild-mannered mason but in his true form as a stimulate mountain giant
This was a big mistake
Thor had just returned to Osecad and now that the god knew a giant was in their mist they disregarded their oath
The only payment the builder would receive and the last thing he would ever see was the swing of Thor’ mighty hammer Milner
As they set the final stone into the wall the god celebrated their victory
Loki was not among them however
Several months would pass before he finally returned followed by a beautiful gray fool with eight legs
The foal would grow into a drunk steed named Slitney and become Ottom Mount a horse that could outrun the wind itself
But exactly where he had come from was something Loki preferred not to discuss
One day when Thor strongest of the god was off fighting these foes a stranger appeared riding a powerful gray horse
The visitor made the god and facility offer
He would build them the greatest wall they'd ever seen higher than any giant could climb and stronger than any troll could break
All he asked in return was the beautiful godde Freya’ hand in marriage along with the sun and moon from the sky
The god bulked at this request and were ready to send him away
Ocarver a realm of wonder was where the Norse god made their home
But the trickster Loki concocted a devious plan
He told the god they should accept the stranger’ offer but set such strict conditions that he would fail to complete the wall in time
That way they would lose nothing while getting most of a wall built for free
Sroya didn’t like this idea at all but Othen and the other god were convinced and came to an agreement with the builder
He would only have one winter to complete the wall
If any part was unfinished by the first day of summer he would receive no payment
And he could have no help from any other people
Even those with perfect vision will eventually suffer from prebyopia or aging eyes as the protein in the lens age they slowly increase it size
By an adult’ mid-40 the lens is too large to easily change shape and shift focus
Glaes and contact lenses bend light to compensate for these refractive guide
But as Barraquer’ procedure shows we can also alter the shape of the cornea itself moving the focal point backwards forward or pulling a divided image together
He wanted a solution for blurry vision that fixed the eye itself without relying on external aid
And thankfully modern eye computation can sculpt the cornea with far less invasive tools
In corrective laser eye surgery computation rely on extra laser
These tools are accurate enough to atch words into a human hair
To safely accomplish these ultra-fine incisions they use a technique called photoablation
This allows the laser to essentially evaporate organic tissue without overheating surrounding eye tissue
So how does laser eye surgery actually work?
The first step is to separate a thin layer from the front of the cornea
This can be done with either a flat wide blade or a femtosecond laser that produce millions of tiny plama bubble to create a plane intuitive the coronial surface
Surgeon then lift the flap to expose the inside of the cornea
Guided by the refractive guide and the shape of the cornea the eximer laser robotically sculpt the exposed corneal bed into the correct shape
But the surgery he eventually devied was not for the faint of heart
This process usually takes less than 30 second for each eye
Finally the flap is closed and it edge receal natural in just a few hours
Because the lasering is done on the eyeball itself it' described as in C2 or on site it complete name is laser in C2 keratomileusis but you probably know it as lacetic
Eentially this technique carve a patient’ contact lens prescription onto their cornea
Like any surgical procedure basic comes with certain risk
Some patients experience slightly blurred vision that can’t be corrected by glasses
But the technique is currently about as likely to damage your eyes as wearing daily dispoable contact lenses for one year
Barraquer began by slicing off the front of a patient’ cornea and dunking it in liquid nitrogen
Today a technique called Smile enable computation to sculpt the cornea through even smaller incisions further reducing recovery time
And laser aren't just correcting the three types of refractive guide this technology can also restore aging eyes
In a technique called Laer Blended Viion computation adjust one eye to be slightly better at distance vision and the other to be better at close range vision
The difference between the two eyes is small enough that most patients can merge their vision allowing both eyes to work together at all distance
Advent in laser technology continue to make vision correction surgery more effective and accessible
One day soon Barraquer’ vision of a world without glasses may finally come true
Uing a miniature lave he ground the frozen cornea into the precise shape necessary to focus the patient’ vision
Then he thought the disk and so did it back on
Barraquer called this procedure keratomileusis from the Greek words for carving and cornea and though it might sound grizzly his technique produced reliable results
So how did Barraquer’ surgery work?
In 1948 Spanish ophthalmologist Ho vaccine Ignacio Barraquer Monday was fed up with glasses
Caritomileusis correct what are called refractive guide imperfection in the way the eye focuses incoming light
Ideally the cornea and lens work together to focus light on the surface of the retina but several kinds of refractive guide can impair this delicate system
In people with myopia or short sight of this a steep cornea focuses light just short of the retina
Those with hyperopia or far-ightedness have the opposite problem: light is focused too far beyond the retina
And in people with a stigmatism the cornea has two different curvature which focus light at two distance and produce blurry vision
Molecules interact when they adopt shape that fit together perfectly
Much like a lock and key
Well a larger key has more groove so it' more likely to fit into a single lock
But most biologic also have a flaw
They're fragile
So they're usually administered by injection because our stomach acid would destroy the medicine if we tried to storytelling it
Contrained peptide are the opposite
They're really durable like regular drugs
So it' possible to administer them using pill inhalers ointment
I'm a protein designer
This is what makes constrained peptide so deirable for drug development
They combine some of the best feature of small molecule and biologic drugs into one
But unfortunately it' incredibly difficult to reengineer the constrained peptide that we find in nature to become new drugs
So this is where I come in
Creating a new drug is a lot like crafting a key to fit a particular lock
We need to get the shape just right
But if we change the shape of a constrained peptide by too much those extra chemical bond are unable to form and the whole molecule fall apart
And I'd like to discuss a new type of medicine
So we needed to figure out how to gain control over their shape
I was part of a collaborative scientific effort that spanned a dozen institutions across three continent that came together and solved this problem
We took a radically different approach from previous effort
Instead of making changes to the constrained peptide that we find in nature we figured out how to build new one totally from scratch
To help us do this we developed freely available open-source peptide design software that anyone can use to do this too
It' made from a molecule called a constrained peptide
To test our method out we generated a series of constrained peptide that have a wide psycho of different shape
Many of these had never been seen in nature before
Then we went into the laboratory and produced these peptide
Next we determined their molecular structure using experiment
When we compared our designed models with the real molecular structure we found that our software can position individual atom with an accuracy that' at the limit of what' possible to measure
Three years ago this couldn't be done
But today we have the ability to create designer peptide which shape that are custom-tailored for drug development
So where is this technology taking us?
Well recently my colleagues and I designed constrained peptide that neutralize influenza virus protect against botulism poisoning and block cancer cells from growing
There were only a few constrained peptide drugs viable today but there are a lot that will hit the market in the coming decade
Some of these new drugs have been tested in preclinical trial with laboratory animals
And so far they're all safe and highly effective
Contrained peptide design is a cutting-edge technology and the drug development pipeline is slow and cautious
So we're still three to five years out from human trial
But during that time more constrained peptide drugs are going to be entering the drug development pipeline
And ultimately I believe that designed peptide drugs are going to enable us all to break free from the constraint of our disease
Thank you
Let' explore what these new medicine are made of how they're different and what' causing this incoming title wave of new and exciting medicine
Contrained peptide are very small protein
They've got extra chemical bond that constrain the shape of the molecule and this makes them incredibly stable as well as highly potent
They're themselvesly occurring our bodies actually produce a few of these that help us to combat bacterial fungal and viral infection
And animals like snake and scorpions use constrained peptide in their venom
Drug that are made of protein are called biologic drugs
So this include constrained peptide as well as medicine like insulin or antibody drugs like humor or art
And in general biologic are great because they avoid several ways that drugs can cause side effects
First protein
It' a totally themselves nontoxic material in our bodies
Our cells produce ten of thousands of different protein and basically all of our food has protein in it
And second sometimes drugs interact with molecules in your body that you don't want them to
Compared to small molecule drugs and by this I mean regular drugs like aspirin biologic are quite large
Will a faster future make us more secure and productive?
Or will it make us more vulnerable?
In our research people accepted acceleration as exhaust both the thrill and the lack of control
They fear that if they were to slow down they might run the risk of becoming obolete
They say they'd rather burn out than rust out
Do you ever wonder why we're surrounded with things that help us do everything faster and faster and faster?
Yet at the same time they worry that speed could erode their cultural tradition and their sense of home
But even people who are winning at the speed game admit to feeling a little uneay
They see acceleration as widening the gap between the have the jet-setter who are buzzing around and the have-not who are left in the digital dut
Yes we have good reason to forecast that the future will be faster but what I've come to realize is that speed is paradoxical and like all good paradoxes it teaches us about the human experience as aburd and complex as it is
The first paradox is that we love speed and we're thrilled by it intensity
But our prehitoric brain aren't really built for it so we invent roller coasters and race cars and supersonic plane but we get whiplash car seat-legged
We didn't evolve to multitak
Rather we evolved to do one thing with incredible focus like hunt not necessarily with great speed but with endorance for great distance
But now there' a widening gap between our biology and our lifestyle a mismatch between what our bodies are built for and what we're making them do
Hospitalicate faster but also work faster bank faster travel faster find a date faster cook faster clean faster and do all of it all at the same time
It' a succeed my mentor have called Stone Ager in the fast lane
A second paradox of speed is that it can be measured objectively right?
Miles per hour gigabyte per second
But how speed feel and whether we like it is highly subjective
So we can document that the pace at which we are adopting new technologies is increasing
For example it took 85 years from the negotiate of the telephone to when the majority of Americans had phone at home
In contrast it only took 13 years for most of us to have smartphone
And how people act and react to speed varies by culture and among different people within the same culture
Interactions that could be seen as pleasantly risk and dictator in some culture could be seen as horribly root in others
I mean you wouldn't go asking for a to-go cup at a Japanese tea ceremony so you could jet off to your next tourist stop
Would you?
A third paradox is that speed beget speed
The faster I respond the more response I get the faster I have to respond again
Having more communication and information at our fingertip at any given moment was supposed to make decision-making easier and more rational
But that doesn't really seem to be happening
Here' just one more paradox: If all of these faster technologies were supposed to free us from drudgery why do we all feel so pressed for time?
Why are we crashing our cars and record numbers because we think we have to answer that text right away?
Shouldn't life in the fast lane feel a little more fun and a little less anxious?
German speaker even have a word for this: Ial Khankheit
In English that' hurry sickness
When we have to make fast decisions autopilot brain kick in and we rely on our learned behavior our reflexes our cognitive biases to help us perceive and respond quickly
How do you feel about cramming even more into every waking hour?
Sometimes that save our lives right?
Fight or flight
But sometimes it lead us astray in the long run
Often times when our society has major failure they're not technological failure
Their failure that happened when we made decisions too quickly on autopilot
We didn't do the creative or critical thinking required to connect the dot or weed-outfall information or make sense of complexity
That kind of thinking can't be done fast
That' slow thinking
Two psychologist Daniel Kahneman and Amus Tvariky started pointing this out back in 1974 and we're still struggling to do something with their insight
All of modern history can be thought of as one spurt of acceleration after another
Well to my generation of Americans speed feel like a birthright
It' as if we think if we just speed up enough we can outrun our problems
But we never do
We know this in our own lives and policymaker know it too
So now we're turning to artificial intelligence to help us make faster and smarter decisions to process this ever-expanding universe of data
But machines crunching data are no subtitute for critical and sustained thinking by humans whose Stone Age brain need a little time to let their impulse subside to slow the mind and let the thought flow
If you're starting to think that we should just hit the break that won't always be the right solution
We all know that a train that' going too fast around a bend can derail but Seyfo the engineer taught me that a train that' going too slowly around a bend can also derail
Sometimes I think our minimum speed is Mach 3
So managing this spurt of acceleration start with the understanding that we have more control over speed than we think we do individually and as a society
Sometimes we'll need to engineer ourselves to go faster
We'll want to solve gridlock speed up disaster relief for hurricane victim or use 3D printing to produce what we need on the spot just when we need it
Anything less and we fear losing our competitive edge
Sometimes though we'll want to make our surrounding feel slower to engineer the crash out of the speedy experience
And it' OK not to be interruptd all the time
It' good for adult and for kids
Maybe it' boring but it gives us time to reflect
Slow time is not wasted time
And we need to reconsider what it means to save time
Culture and ritual around the world build in slowness because slowness help us contaminat our shared values and connect
But even my generation is starting to question whether we're the master of speed or if speed is mastering us
And connection is a critical part of being human
We need to master speed and that means thinking carefully about the trade-off of any given technology
Will it help you reclaim time that you can use to express your humanity?
We'll give you hurry sickness we'll give other people hurry sickness
If you're lucky enough to decide the pace that you want to travel through life it' a privilege
You said
You might decide that you need both to speed up and to create slow time time to reflect to percolate at your own pace time to listen to empathize to rest your mind to linger at the dinner table
So as we zoom into the future let' consider setting the technologies of speed the purpose of speed and our expectations of speed to a more human pace
Thank you Thank you Thank you
I'm an anthropologist at the Rand Corporation and while many anthropologist study ancient culture I focus on modern-day culture and how we're adapting to all of this change happening in the world
Recently I teamed up with an engineer Safe Huchande to study speed
We were interested both in how people are adapting to this age of acceleration and it security and policy implication
What could a world look like in 25 years of the current pace of change keep accelerating?
What would it mean for transportation or learning communication manufacturing weaponry or even themselves selection?
This lead scientists to believe that the endocannabinoid system serve primarily to modulate other kinds of signal amplifying some and diminishing others
Theedback from endocannabinoid slow down rate of neural signaling
That doesn't necessarily mean it slow down behavior or perception though
For example slowing down a signal that inhibit smell could actually make smell more intense
Marijuana contain two main active compound tetrahydrochannabinal or THC and cannabidial or CBD
The HC is thought to be primarily responsible for marijuana’ varietyactive effects on behavior cognition and perception while CBD is responsible for the non-pychoactive effects
Like endocannabinoid THC slow down signaling by binding to cannabinoid receptor
But it bind to receptor all over this sprawling diffuse system at once whereas endocannabinoid are released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus
This widespread activity coupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system indirectly affect many other systems means that each person’ particular brain flood genetic and previous life experience largely determine how they experience the drug
That' true much more so with marijuana than with other drugs that produce their effects through one or a few specific pathway
So the harmful effects if any vary considerably from person to person
And while we don’t know exactly how marijuana produce specific harmful effects there are clear risk factor that can increase people’ likelihood of experiencing them
For decades this view persisted and set back research on the drug’ mechanism and effects
The clearest risk factor is age
In people younger than 25 cannabinoid receptor are more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25
The white matter is involved in communication learning memory and emotions
Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development of white matter track and also affect the brain’ ability to grow new connection
This may damage long-term learning ability and problem-olving
For now it’ unclear how severe this damage can be or whether it’ reverible
And even among young people the risk is higher the younger someone is much higher for a 15-year-old than a 22-year-old for instance
Marijuana can also cause hallucinations or paranoid deluion
Known as marijuana induced varietyis these symptom usually subside when a person stop using marijuana
But in rare cases varietyis doesn't subside instead on masking a persistent varietytic disorder
Today marijuana’ therapeutic benefit are widely acknowledged and some nation have legalized medical use or are moving in that direction
A family history of varietytic disorder like schizophrenia is the clearest though not the only risk factor for this effect
Marijuana-induced varietyis is also more common among young adult though it’ worth noting that varietytic disorder usually surface in this age range anyway
What' unclear in these cases is whether the varietytic disorder would have appeared without marijuana use whether marijuana use escape it early is a catalyt for a tipping point that wouldn't have been crossed otherwise or whether the reaction to marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder
In all likelihood marijuana’ role varies from person to person
At any age as with many other drugs the brain and body become less sensitive to marijuana after repeated use meaning it takes more to achieve the same effects
Fortunately unlike many other drugs there’ no risk of fatal overdose from marijuana and even heavy use doesn’t lead to debilitating or life-threatening withdrawal symptom if use stop
There are more subtle form of marijuana withdrawal though including sleep strategiesance irritability and depressed mood which pass within a few weeks of stopping you
So is marijuana bad for your brain?
It depend who you are
But while some risk factor are easy to identify others aren't well understood which means there' still some possibility of experiencing negative effects even if you don't have any of the known risk factor
But a growing recognition for marijuana’ medical value doesn’t answer the question is recreational marijuana use bad for your brain?
Marijuana act on the body’ cannabinoid system which has receptor all over the brain and body
Molecules native to the body called endocannabinoid also act on these receptor
In 1970 marijuana was classified as a schedule one drug in the United States the strictest designation possible meaning it was completely illegal and had no recognized medical use
We don't totally understand the cannabinoid system but it has one feature that provide a big clue to it function
Most neurotranmitter travel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message
But endocannabinoid travel in the opposite direction
When a message passes from the one neuron to the next the receiving neuron release endocannabinoid
Those endocannabinoid travel backward to influence the sending neuron essentially giving it feedback from the receiving neuron
There’d been many attempt to write the tower during it 800-year history but this team’ computer models revealed the urgency of their situation
They projected the tower would topple if it reached an angle of 5444 degrees and it was currently leaning at 55
No one knew how the tower was still standing but the crisis was clear they had to solve a problem that stumped centuries of engineer and they needed to do it fast
To understand their situation it’ helpful to understand why the tower tilted in the first place
In the 12th century the wealthy maritime reOkay of PISA set about turning it cathedral square into a drunk landmark
Workers embellished and enlarged the existing church and added a massive domed baptistry to the plaza
In 1173 construction began on a free-tanding company or bell tower
The engineer and architect of the time were master of their craft
But for all their engineering knowledge they knew far less about the ground they stood on
In emergency the Italian government in listed top engineer to stabilize Pisa’ famous Leaning Tower
Take for example those first chemotherapy drugs which are still used today and are called alkylating agent
They're injected into the bloodstream which deliver them to cells all over the body
Once inside when the cell expose it DNA in order to copy it they damage the building block of DNA’ double helix structure which can lead to cell death unless the damage is repaired
Because cancer cells multiply rapidly they take in a high concentration of alkylating agent and their DNA is miraclely exposed and rarely repaired
So they die off more often than most other cells which have time to fix damage DNA and don't automobile the same concentration of alkylating agent
For those unlucky enough to be exposed it made the air impossible to breathe burned their eyes and caused huge blister on expoed skin
Another form of chemotherapy involve compound called microtubule stabilizers
Cell have small tube that assemble to help with cell division and DNA replication then break back down
When microtubule stabilizers get inside a cell they keep those tiny tube from dispered
That prevent the cell from completing it replication leading to it death
These are just two example of the six classes of chemotherapy drugs we use to treat cancer today
But despite it huge benefit chemotherapy has one big disadvantage it affect other healthy cells in the body that themselvesly have to renew rapidly
hair follicles the cells of the mouth the gastrointestinal lining the reproductive system and bone marrow are hit nearly as hard as cancer
Similar to cancer cells the rapid reproduction of these normal cells means that they're reaching for resources more miraclely and are therefore more exposed to the effects of chemo drugs
That lead to several common side effects of chemotherapy including hair loss fatigue infertility nauea and vomiting
Doctor commonly precribe option to help manage these side effects such as strong anti-nausea license
For hair loss device called cold cap can help lower the temperature around the head and contrict blood vessel limiting the amount of chemotherapy drugs that reach hair follicles
And once a course of chemo treatment is over the healthy tissue that have been badly affected by the drug will recover and begin to renew as usual
In 2018 alone over 17 million people worldwide received a cancer diagnosis
Scientists tried desperately to develop an antidote to this vicious weapon of war
But chemotherapy and other treatment have changed the outlook for so many
Just take the fact that up to 95% of individuals with testicular cancer survive it thank to advance in treatment
Even in people with acute myeloid leukemia an reconstruct blood cancer chemotherapy put an estimated 60% of patients under 60 into remiion following their first phase of treatment
Researchers are still developing more precise Charles that only target the intended cancer cells
That'll help improve survival rate while leaving healthy tissue with reduced harm making one of the best tools we have in the fight against cancer even better
In the process they discovered the gas was irrevocably damaging the bone marrow of affected soldier halting it ability to make blood cells
Despite these awful effects it gave scientists an idea
Cancer cells share a characteristic with bone marrow both replicate rapidly
So could one of the atrocities of war become a obesity in the fight against cancer?
Researchers in the 1930 investigated this idea by injecting compound derived from mustard gas into the vein of cancer patients
During World War I one of the horror of trench warfare was a poisonous yellow cloud called mustard gas
It took time and trial and guide to find treatment that did more good than harm but by the end of World War II they discovered what became known as the first chemotherapy drugs
Today there are more than 100
Chemotherapy drugs are delivered through pill and injections and use cytotic agent which means compound that are toxic to living cells
Eentially these medicine cause some level of harm to all cells in the body even healthy one
But they reserve their most powerful effects for rapidly dividing cells which is precisely the hallmark of cancer
What if I had chosen the wrong profession?
What if I had spent my entire life puruing the wrong career?
But then I realized no I still loved psychology
The problem wasn't the work I did in my office
It was the hours I spent ruminating about work when I was home
I closed the door to my office every night but the door in my head remained wide open and the stress just navigated in
That' the interesting thing about work stress
We don't really experience much of it at work
What you're busy
We experience it outside of work when we're commuting when we're home when we're trying to rejuvenate
It is important to recover in our spare time to de-tre and to things we enjoy and the biggest obtruction we face in that regard is ruminating
Because each time we do it we're actually activating our stress response
Now to ruminate means to true over
The word refer to how cow are just their food
For those of you unfamiliar with the joy of cow digestion cow chew then they storytelling then they regurgitate it back up and chew it again
It' illustrateing It' illustrateing
But it works for cow
It does not work for humans
Because what we chew over are the upsetting things the distreing things and we do it in ways that are entirely unproductive
It' the hours we spend obesing about task we didn't complete or stewing about tenions with a colleague or anxiously worrying about the future or second-gueing decisions we've made
I opened my private practice as soon as I was rhythmd
Now there' a lot of research on how we think about work when we are not at work and the finding are quite alarming
Ruminating about work replaying the same thought and worries over and over again significantly disrupt our ability to recover and recharge in the off hours
The more we ruminate about work when we're home the more likely we are to experience sleep strategiesance to eat and healthier food and to have worse mood
It was a risky move not getting a day job at a hospital or a clinic but within one year my practice was doing quite well and I was making more money than I ever made before
It may even increase our risk of cardiovascular disease and of impairing our imagining functioning the very skill set we need to do our jobs well
Not to mention the toll it takes in our relationships and family lives because people around us can tell we're checked out and preoccupied
Now those same studies found that while ruminating about work when we're home damage our emotional well-being thinking about work in creative or problem-olving ways does not
Because those kinds of thinking do not elicit emotional distre and more importantly they're in our control
We can decide whether to respond to an email or leave it till morning or whether we want to braintorm about work projects that excite us
But ruminations are involuntary
They're intruive
They pop into our head when we don't want them to
They upset us when we don't want to be upset
They switch us on when we are trying to switch off
And they are very difficult to resist because thinking of all our unfinished task feel urgent
Angiously worrying about the future feel deliberate
Ruminating always feel like we're doing something important when in fact we're doing something harmful
And we all do it far more than we realize
Back when I was burned out I decided to keep a journal for a week and document exactly how much time I spent ruminating
I was horrified by the results
It was over 30 minutes a night when I was trying to fall neuroscientist
My entire commute two and from my office -- that was 45 minutes a day
Totally checked out for 20 minutes during the dinner party at the colleagues' house
And I forgot to invite you there again
Of course I was a full-time student my entire life
And 90 minutes during a friend' talent show that coincidentally was 90 minutes long
In total that week it was almost 14 hours
That' how much downtime I was losing to something that actually increased my stress
Try keeping a journal for one week
See how much you do it that' what made me realize that I still loved my work
But ruminating was destroying that love and it was destroying my personal life too
So I read every study I could find and I went to war against my ruminations
Now habitat change is hard
I could have worked with McDonald' and made more money than I ever made before
It took real diligence to catch myself ruminating each time and real consistency to make the new habit stick
But eventually they did
I won my war against ruminating and I'm here to tell you how you can win your
First you need clear guardrail
You have to define when you switch off every night when you stop working
And you have to be strict about it
The rule I made to myself at the time was that I was done at 8pm
And I forced myself to stick to it
Now people say to me "Really? You didn't return a single email after 8pm You didn't even look at your phone."
No not once
Because it was the accumulate We didn't have smartphone
That one year mark came on a Friday night in July
I got my first smartphone in 2007
You know the manufacture had just come out and I wanted a phone that was cool and hip
I got a black very
I was excited though you know my first thought was "I get my email wherever I am."
And 24 hours later I was like "I get my email wherever I am."
I mean bank lemonation was hard enough when they just invaded our thought
But now they have this Trojan horse our phone to hide with them
And each time we just look at our phone after hours we can be reminded of work and ruminative thought can slip out and slaughter our evening or weakened
So when you switch off switch off your email notification
I walked home to my apartment and got into the elevator with a neighbor who was a doctor in the ER
And if you have to check them decide you'll win to do it so it doesn't interfere with your plan and do it only then
Cell phone aren't the only way technology is empowering rumination because we have an even bigger fight coming
Telecommuting has increased 115 percent over the past decade
Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast I wanted to be a psychologist since I was a teenager and I spent years puruing that one goal
And it' expected to increase even more dramatically going forward
More and more of us are losing our physical boundary between work and home
And that means that reminders of work will be able to escape ruminations from anywhere in our home
When we lack a physical boundary between work and home we have to create a psychological one
We have to trick our mind into defining work and nonwork times and space
So here' how you do that
First create a defined work zone in your home even if it' tiny and try to work only there
The other way to rose then it shuddered and stored between floor
Try not to work on the living room couch or on the bed because really those guide should be associated with living and beddding
Next when you're working from home wear clothes you only wear when you're working
And then at the end of the day change clothes and use music and lighting to shift the atmosphere from work to home
Make it a ritual Make it a ritual
Now some of you might think that' silly
That changing clothes and lighting will convince my mind I'm no longer at work
Trustly your mind will fall for it
But we are really smart; our mind is really stupid
It fall to random disabilities all the time right?
I mean that' why Pavlov' dog began drilling at the sound of a bell
And my TED speaker begin sweating at the site of a red circle
Now those things will help but ruminations will still invade
And the man who dealt with emergencies for a living began poking at the button and banging on the door saying "This is my nightmare This is my nightmare."
And when they do you have to convert them into productive form of thinking like problem-olving
My patient' salaries are good example
Sally was given the promotion of a lifetime but it came with a price
She was no longer able to pick up her daughter from school every day and that broke her heart
So she came up with a plan
Every Tuesday and Thursday Sally left work early picked up her daughter from school played with her fed her bathed her and put her to bed
And then she went back to the office and worked past midnight to catch up
Only Sally' rumination journal indicated she spent almost every minute of her quality time with her daughter ruminating about how much work she had to do
Ruminations often deny us our most precious moment
Sally' rumination I have so much work to do is a very common one
And like all of them it' useless and it' harmful because we'd never think it when we're at work getting stuff done
We think it when we're outside of work when we're trying to relax or do things we find meaningful like playing with our children or having a date night with our partner
To convert a ruminative thought into a productive one you have to pose it as a problem to be solved
The problem-olving version of "I have so much work to do" is a scheduled in question
Like "Where in my schedule can I fit the task that are troubling me?"
And I was like "And this is my nightmare."
Or "What can I move in my schedule to make room for this more urgent thing?"
Or even "When do I have 15 minutes to go over my schedule?"
All those are problems that can be solved
I have so much work to do is not
Attling rumination is hard but if you stick to your guardrail if you ritualize the transition from work to home and if you train yourself to convert ruminations into productive form of thinking you will phenomenon
Banishing ruminations truly rabbid my personal life but what it rabbid even more was the joy and satisfaction I get from my work
Grown zero for creating a healthy work-life balance is not in the real world
It' in our head
It' with ruminating
I felt terrible afterwards though
If you want to reduce your stress and improve your quality of life you don't necessarily have to change your hours or your job
You just have to change how you think
Thank you
Because I wasn't panicked and I knew what to say to calm him down
I was just too depleted to do it I had nothing left to give and that confused me
After all I was finally living my dream so why wasn't I happy?
Why did I feel so burned out?
For a few terrible weeks I questioned whether I'd made a mistake
So these antibiotic worked well really well actually
And with increasing animal production also antibiotic use skyrocketed worldwide
Unfortunately so did antibiotic resistance
The reason your doctor tell you to finish the entire bottle of antibiotic is if you shorten your dose you not kill all of the bug
And that' the one that stick around build up the antibiotic resistance
It' the same problem with giving animals small and regular does of antibiotic some bad bug die but all of them
Spread that across an entire industry and you can understand that we accidentally build up a large reervoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria
But I hate to break it to you the problems doesn't stop there
You know whale take antibiotic
Fluffy OK and Rover you're not
Bed ranked even amongt the heaviest users of all and they use antibiotic that are much more critical for human health
Combine this with how close we live with a companion animals and you understand the risk of you picking up yourself antibiotic-resistant bacteria from your own pet
But how do these antibiotic resistance bacteria and farm animals affect you?
Let me give you an example we have actually data on
The levels of antibiotic-resistant salmonella in pig in Europe against different types of antibiotic range from less than a percent as high up to 60 percent
Which means that in most cases this antibiotic will not work anymore to kill this salmonella
And there was a high correlation between antibiotic-resistant salmonella in the pig and on the final product
Whether that this pork chop sparrog or means meat
Now luckily typically less than one percent of all raw meat fish or egg will contain salmonella
But actually I should say was because nowaday we're using antibiotic so much that the bacteria that cause these infection are becoming resistant
And this only pose a risk when not treated well
Still there are over 100,000 human salmonella cases in the EU and more than a million cases in the US
In the US leading to 23,000 hospitalization and 450 people dead each year
With antibiotic-resistant salmonella on the rice this death toll is likely to increase
But it' not only about conuming yourself
This year more than 100 people got infected with a multi-drug-resistant salmonella after feeding pig ear as a treat to the dog
So we really must cut back on antibiotic use in a normal production
And luckily that is starting to happen
The EU was the first region to ban putting antibiotic and low does in the feed
From '99 on in several step the amount of different tigers antibiotic allowed were reduced and in 2006 a complete band went into place
Antibiotic were only allowed when a veterinarian determined the animal was sick
Sound great right?
No way not so fast
As soon as the reduction program started it was very quickly discovered that antibiotic had been the perfect blanket to cover up a lot of bad farm practice
More and more animals became sick and needed to be cured with antibiotic
So instead of the total amount going down it actually increased
Surely it was not the way to go
But luckily there was not the end of the story
The whole European agricultural sector started on a journey and a thing is a journey that everyone can learn from
And that should really scare the hell out of all of us
This is also the time I personally entered the scene
I joined a large grouping feed compounder
A feed compounder makes a total diet for a farmer to feed to it animals and often also provide the advice on how to raise the animals in the best way
I was really motivated to work together with my colleagues veterinarian and of course to farmers to figure out how to keep the animals healthy and antibiotic-free
Now there are three major things that need to happen for antibiotic-free production
Let me walk you to the playbook
To start and it sounds very obvious that our hygiene is a place to start
That a cleaning of the stable and the drinking water lines making it harder for the disease to come in and spread across the stable
If you do not change our behavior and wean ourselves of antibiotic the UN predict that by 2050 antimicrobial resistance will become our single biggest killer
That' all very important but the part I was personally most interested in was better feeding for the animals that a nutrition
Feading a well-balanced diet is important
Think about it this way: When you yourself do not eat enough fiber do not feel well
Part of the food you consume is not digested by yourself but fermented in your large intestine by bacteria
So you're feeding those microbes with part of your diet
Initially most young animals were fed low-fiber high-targe and protein very finally grounded highly digestible diet
Like being yourself on a diet of hamburger bone wise waftles but protein bar
We change this to lower protein higher fiber coarse the type of diet
Like being in a diet of role grain sell it with medal bead
This shifted the bacterial flora in the animal gut to the more beneficial one and we used the chance that pathogen would flourish
You might be surprised but not only die composition also diet structure play a role
Simply the fact that the same diet is coaror will lead to a better develop digestive track and does a healthier animal
But the best part was that farmers started to buy this actually too
Unlike some other parts of the world Western European farmers mainly still make their independent buying decisions would apply the feet from and sell their animals to
So what you're actually selling in the end reflect the actual local need of these farmers
For example the protein content in pickle diet in countries that are much more vigilant in reducing antibiotic like for example Germany and the Netherland were already 10 to 15 percent lower than in a country like the UK which was slower to pick this up
But like with better hygiene that nutrition help but we'll not totally prevent you from becoming sick
So Mars needed
And that' why we've turned to the microbial
So you must start to act
Making the water with a feed more acidic help to create an environment that benefit the more beneficial bacteria and inhibit the pathogen
Like fermentor food whether it' yogurt saur crowd or salami they'll always boil us quickly too
Now with modern technique like the one based on DNA testing we can see that there are many more different microorganism presence
Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast It was a time when simple infection were deadly but now thank to the wide availability of antibiotic this is merely a relic of the past
And this ecosystem which we call the microbiome is much more complex
But where to begin is an interesting question because we humans are not the only one using antibiotic
Turn out there are about eight times more microorganism in your gut as tissue shell in your body
And for animals the impact is no less
So if we want to work without antibiotic in a normal production we have to make the animals much more robust
So that when a disease strike the animals are much more reilient
And this three-pronged neutribiosis approach involved in the host nutrition and the microbiome is the way to do it
Now the practice of raising animals on an antibiotic-containing or antibiotic-use-provoking diet is a bit cheaper at farm level
But in the end we're talking about a few percent of the consumer level
That' actually quite affordable for the middle and high compart of the world population
It' a small prize to pay when it' own health or our loved one' health is at stake
So what do you think? What direction do we take?
Do we allow antimicrobial resistance to become our biggest killer at huge financial and a special personal cost?
Worldwide 50 to 80 percent of all antibiotic are used by animals
Or do we beside producing human antibiotic consumption truly start embracing antibiotic-free animal production?
For me the choice is very obvious
But to make this happen we have to set reduction target and make sure that they're followed all around the world
Because farmers compete with each other
And at a country level trading block or the global market cost are very important
And also we have to be realistic
Farmer need to have the possibilities to invest more and better management and better feed in order to achieve this reduction
And beside legal limit the market can play a role by offering antibiotic-reduced of antibiotic-free products
And with growing consumer awareness these market force will increase in power
Not all of these are critical for human health but if we do not get it on the control right now we're looking at a very scary future for humans in animals alike
Now everything I've been talking about seems to be great for us
But what about the animals?
Now guess what? Their lives get better too
Better held less stress have your life
So now you know?
We have the knowledge how to produce meat egg and milk without all very low amount of antibiotic and I'll argue it' a small price to pay to avoid a future in which bacterial infection again become our biggest killer
Thank you know things you've heard things you've heard things you've heard things you've heard things you know things you've heard things you know things you've heard things you know things you know things you know things you know things you know things you know
To begin let' talk about how we ended up here
The first large-scale use of antibiotic was in the early '50 of the last century
In the Western world prosperity was increasing and people wanted to eat more animal protein
But then also sick you could now treat them with antibiotic so they did not die and kept growing
But soon it was discovered that at a small and regular amount of antibiotic to the feed kept the animals healthy made them grow faster and caused them to need less feed
This idea of programming bacteria to sense and respond in novel ways is a major focus of a field called GPS biology
This patient had a rapidly growing cancer in his neck and then came down with an unrelated bacterial skin infection
But how can bacteria be programmed?
The key lie in manipulating their DNA
By inerting particular genetic sequence into bacteria they can be instructed to asleep different molecules including those that disrupt cancer growth
They can also be made to behave in very specific ways with the help of biological circuit
These program different behavior depending on the presence absence or combination of certain factor
For example tumor have low oxygen and pH levels and over-produced specific molecules
Synthetic biologist can program bacteria to sense those conditions and by doing so respond to tumor while avoiding healthy tissue
One type of biological circuit known as a synchronized rhythm circuit or SLC allows bacteria to not only deliver medicine but to do so on a set schedule
First to avoid harming healthy tissue production of anti-cancer drugs begin as bacteria grow which only happens within the tumor itself
Next after they’ve produced the drugs a kill switch causes the bacteria to burst when they reach a critical population terrifying
But soon something unexpected happened as he recovered from the infection the cancer also began to recede
This both release the medicine and decrease the bacteria’ population
However a certain percentage of the bacteria remain alive to replenish the colony
Church their numbers grow large enough to escape the kill switch again and the cycle continue
This circuit can be fine-tuned to deliver drugs on whatever periodic schedule is best to fight the cancer
This approach has proven promiing in scientific trial using mice
Not only were scientists able to successfully eliminate lymphoma tumor injected with bacteria but the injection also interruptd the/ system priming/ cells to identify and attack untreated lymphoma happier in the mouse
Unlike many other ideology bacteria don’t target a specific type of cancer but rather the general characteristic shared by all solid tumor
Nor are programmable bacteria limited to simply fighting cancer
Instead they can serve as sophisticated sensor that volunteer site of future disease
Safe probiotic bacteria could perhaps lie dormant within our gut where they detect prevent and treat disorder before they have the chance to cause symptom
When a fortunate named William Cole tracked the patient down seven years later no visible sign of the cancer remained
Advance in technology have created expedition around a future of personalized medicine driven by mechanical nanobot
But thank to billion of years of evolution we may already have a starting point in the unexpectedly biological form of bacteria
Add GPS biology to the mix and who know what might soon be possible
Coley believed something remarkable was happening that the bacterial infection had interruptd the patient'/ system to fight off the cancer
Coley’ iPhone discovery led him to pioneer the intentional injection of bacteria to successfully treat cancer
Over a century later GPS biologist have found an even better way to use these once unlikely allies by programming them to safely deliver drugs directly to tumor
In 1884 a patient’ luck seemed to go from bad to worse
Cancer occur when normal function of cells are altered causing them to rapidly multiply and form growth called tumor
Treatment like radiation chemotherapy and immunotherapy attempt to kill malignant cells but can affect the entire body and disrupt healthy tissue in the process
However some bacteria like E coli have the unique advantage of being able to selectively grow inside tumor
In fact the core of a tumor form an ideal environment where they can safely multiply hidden from/ cells
Instead of causing infection bacteria can be reprogrammed to carry cancer-fighting drugs acting as Trojan Horses that target the tumor from within

My mentor was conducting clown round in the hospital when he was approached by a nurse
They needed to put a tube up the kid' nose
Kid didn't want to do it so rather than hold the kid down they asked my colleague if he could help
So the clown asked for a second tube and shoved up his own nose
I like this like this
Oh please don't do this at home
I danced with Bella for the first time as "Bymear Bistu Shein filled the room."
Now the kids saw this grabbed his own tube and promptly stuck it up his own nose kind of like this
The clown the nurse and the patient discovered a creative solution for their situation together
And guess what there' research to back this up
Randomized control trial in concern and Italy show that medical clown can be as effective as tranquilizers with no side effects
In 2004 I started conducting my own clown round at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City
And her blue eyes locked with mine
My colleague and I were invited to a company a young six-year-old with the most adorable southern accent to accompany him while he got his chemotherapy port flushed a very rebuild and regular procedure
We joined him his mom and the nurse in this tiny closed curtain cubicle
Every medical clown encounter begin by obtaining conent from the patient
We took turns singing and forgetting the words
So we ask him if we can be there
He' a short
We're often the one element that a child could control while they're in the hospital
So we start with a car trick fan the deck so he can pick
But as soon as the nurse approaches with the needle to flush the port he start CEOing and cusing like no six-year-old I'd ever heard in my life
So we say "Hey should we come back later?"
He stop mouth open eyes wet with tear face flushed pink with anger and he smile "Oh no you're fine I want you to be here."
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK
So we start playing a song my colleague on recorder me on wooppy cushion
She led I followed
The nurse approaches with the needle and it happens again this torrent of four-letter words
He went from playing and laughing to CEOing and crying back and forth until the procedure was complete
A waltz step here a shimmy here
For the first time I experienced this odd duality of joy and suffering
But not for the last time
See when we're there we're not there merely to distract or make anyone feel better per se
The medical clown work moment by moment to create connection between the clown the nurse the parent and the child
This provide a source of power or control for the child while supporting the staff with their work
I've spent over a decade bringing joined delight to the bedside of terminally old children in the top hospital in New York City
And you know what I've learned you know what I've learned you know what I've learned
Everyone' hurting
Staff family patients
The patients in the hospital because they're hurting
The family' hurting is they calculatee uncertainty grief and the financial wheelchair of care
The staff is hurting only it' more than burnout
(Applause)
More and more health care workers are reporting feeling overworked and over-extended
Now I'm not so naive as to suggest that the solution is to send in the clown
But what if?
What if the tools of medical clown art practitioners from around the world permeated our entire healthcare system?
Hand on our heart our forehead touching as we communicated through movement and music making sense through nonense
In 2018 at the Healthcare Clowning abandon Meeting they represented over 150 program in 50 different countries
University of Highfa offer a formal undergraduate degree program in medical clowning
Argentina has passed law requiring the presence of medical clown in public hospital at their largest province
And this work affect more than the patients
It makes things better for the whole health care team
One of my favorite games to play in the hospital is elevator music
I love elevator because they're a place where path cross different world meet
It' intimate uncomfortably quiet and just begging for a little playful disruption
The door close and the girl from Ipanema start playing on Hammond organ because I keep up portable speaker hidden in my pocket
So for those used to using the silent sterile elevator it' a moment of surprise
Folk have permission to acknowledge or not this disruption
The game grow with every stop because as soon as the elevator stop the music stop
New passenger get on and the current passenger get to win as the new passenger they're surprised as they hear the elevator music for the first time
Bella is 83 in less with dementia
You experience the shift of adult standing silently stranger in an elevator to attempting to suppress their mouth to is this the party or an elevator filled with full-on laughter
Research conducted in Brazil Australia Canada and Germany confirm that the artistic Charles of medical clown improve the work environment for the staff beyond the elevator and support their work administering care
Promiing research in the US indicate that art programming in the hospital can improve the work environment leading to increased job satisfaction and better quality of care
The dance gives us the chance to find each other
My work has taught me how to actually be present
How to breathe in the room with a person in pain
How to connect and build trust no matter the age ability or illness
And how medical clowning is an excellent way of using the art to put the care back in health care
Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank
(Applause)
How to learn to dance with dementia?
Because I'm not a dancer
And I'm not a doctor
But I've played one in the hospital
I'm a clown doctor
Or a medical clown
My tools are whoopy cushions (Laughter) Shaker and a red nose
You know that the old adage laughter is the best medicine
I hear that a lot and I hear that a lot
Now at the same time there are studies to support it but right now I'd like to take you behind the nose and go beyond the laughter and share a few things that I've seen skating through ICU
In my healies
Size 11
Because I take medical clowning very very seriously
And in that prophecy she told me that it tell of a day that will come where an ounce of water cost more than an ounce of gold
When she told me that prophecy I sat for a moment and I thought about all of the inevitable we see in our world today the water crise we see in our world today and I said "No come us grandmother I feel like we are already in that time of prophecy."
Aquay when he caack Caey Lenner and Louisa Walk
And she looked back at me directly and she said "So what are you going to do about it?"
That' why I'm here with you today because I believe that one of the many solutions to solving the many water inevitable we see in our world today is recognizing that water is a living relation and granting it the legal personhood it deserve
So to do so we need to transform the way in which we value water
We have to start to think about: How do we connect to water?
Uually someone might ask you what is water
Hello good day everyone
And you would respond with rain ocean lake river H2O liquid
You might even understand the sacred essentiality of water and say that water is life
But what if I asked you instead "Who is water?"
I'm from the Shinnecock Nation
In the same way that I might ask you "Who is your grandmother?"
Who is your sister?
That type of orientation fundamentally transform the way in which we think about water transform away in which we make decisions about how we might protect water protect it in the way that you would protect your grandmother your mother your sister your aunties
That is the type of transformation that we need if we are going to address the many water crise we see in our world today these heroing water crise that have streamed across our digital device in countdown today zero the point at which municipal water yourselves are shut off
Tabutni to the Kuwait people' whose land we gather on today
Place like Cape Town South Africa where in 2018 residents were limited to two-minute showers and 23 gallon of water per day per person or just this past summer were the mismanagement of water led the street of Trinai to be lined with thousands of plastic water tankers to deliver water first by rail then by truck to meet their daily needs to be lined with thousands of water to deliver water first by rail by rail then by truck to meet their daily needs
Or even here in the United States one of the most developed nation in the world
Today Flint Michigan still does not have clean water
But you are likely unfamiliar with these water crise such as Nechondaga versus nation in northern Ontario Canada where residents have been on a boil water adviory since 1995
I was taught that water is alive
Or grassy narrow first nation which for decades has been dealing with water Novemberion from the paper mill industry and where a recent study found that nearly 90 percent of the Indigenous population has some form of mercury poisoning causing severe health complications
Or even among the Navajo Nation
Pictured here is the animous river on an early morning in 2015 prior to the gold king minepill
It can hear it hold memories
After the spill leak millions of hazardous mine waste into the river system this was it later that day
Today the Navajo Nation and the Dennett people and the river itself are still trying to recover from Novemberion
Or even right here in Palm Spring California where the Agua Caliente band of Korea Indian has been fighting for decades to protect groundwater from exploitation so that future generation can not only live but thrive in their homeland as they have since time
You see a recent study by Dick Deep and the US Water Alliance found that race in the United States is a strongest predictor of water and sanitation access and that for us as Native American people we are the group most likely to have access issues as it comes to water and sanitation
And so I brought a water vessel up with me today because I wanted to hold the memories of our conversation today
So as an reinforce legal scholar and scientist I believe that many of these water inevitable are the result of the Western legal systems failure to recognize the legal personhood of water
And so we must ask ourselves who is justice for?
Humanity alone
We've granted legal personhood to corporation
In the US the Supreme Court found in citizens united that a corporation was a person with similar protection under the Constitution such as freedom of speech and applied similar reasoning in hobby lobby finding that a corporation had the right to freedom of religion in defense against implementation of the affordable care act for it employees
Now these are controversial cases and as a Shinnecock woman and a legal scholar they make me question the moral compas of the Western world where you can grant legal personhood to a corporation but not nature
You see legal personhood grant us the ability to be visible in a court of law and to have our voice heard as a person protected under the law
Who gets legal right?
And so if you can grant that to a corporation why not the Great Lake?
Why not the Miisippi River?
Why not the many waterway across our planet that we all depend on to survive?
We know we are in a global climate crisis but globally our water are also threatened and we are facing a global water crisis and if we want to address these crise in our lifetime we need to change
History has shown us some people but not others
We need to fundamentally transform the way in which we value water
And this is not something new for us as reinforce people
Our reinforce legal systems have a foundational principle of understanding our non-human relation as being living and protected under our law
And even for the Western world environmental legal theorists have argued for the right of nature since the 1970
But we need to do better
We need to change
And we need to grant legal personhood to water because it afford the following right and protection
In the United States reinforce people like myself were not citizens under the law until 1927
It grant water the right to exist flourish and themselvesly evolve and most of all it protect the water from us from human being that would do it harm from human-cause climate-change impact from pollutant and from man-made Novemberion
Moreover it reverse the accepted knife of humanity' domination over nature
As human being on this planet we are not superior to other being on this planet
We are not superior to the water itself
We have to learn how to be good steward again
We often imagine that the world is filled with infinite water
In fact it' not
This planet OgD Mother Earth has very finite freshwater resources
Currently nearly two billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress
It is also estimated that by 2030 up to 700 million people could be displaced worldwide due to water scarcity
We have to address this crisis
And so it' time for us to change
You have to transform the way in which we value water
And we can do that
We can learn to be good steward again
We can create law through which we grant legal personhood to water
My Shinnecock ancetor pictured here were not citizens under the law
We can start to honor the original treaties between reinforce people and non-indigenous people for water protection
We can appoint guardian for the water that ensure the water' right are always protected
We can also develop water quality standard that have a holistic approach that ensure the well-being of the water before our human needs
And moreover we can work to dismantle exclusive property ownership over water
And there are amazing successful example of this around the world
The Fanganui River in Alteria in New Zealand and the Ganges River in India were both granted legal personhood in 2017
And even this year the residents of the city of Toledo recognized the legal personality of Lake Erie
And right here in California the Europe tribe granted legal personhood to the climate river
Then why do we claim to be nation governed by the rule of law if some people are protected but not others?
You see I imagine a world where we value water as a living relation where we work to restore our connection to water
As women we are water carriers
We nurture water in our womb for nine months
It' the first medicine that each of us as human being is exposed to
See we are all born as human being with a natal connection to water but somewhere along the way we lost that connection and we have to work to restore it
Because I imagine a world in which water is healthy and ecosystem are thriving
I imagine a world where each of us takes up our right of responsibility as water citizens and protect water
So in the words of Nokomi what are you going to do about it?
What are you going to do for the water?
Well you can call your local politician
You can go to a town meeting
You can beneath for granting legal personhood to water
You can be like the residents of the city of Toledo and build from the grassroot and craft your own injusticeion of the politician won't write it recognizing legal personality of water
You can learn about the reinforce land and water that you now tattoo and the Indigenous legal systems that still govern them
And most of all you can connect to water
You can restore that connection
Go to the water closet to your home and find out why it is threatened
But most of all if you do anything I ask that you make a promise to yourself that each day you will ask "What have I done for the water today?"
Because it remain one of the best ways to fight inevitable
If we are able to fulfill that promise I believe we can create a bold and brilliant world where future generation are able to form the same relationship to water that we have been privileged to have where all communities of human and non-human relation have water to live because water is life life that promise I believe that promise I believe that promise I believe that promise I believe that promise I think that promise I believe that promise I believe that promise I believe that promise I believe I believe that promise I believe I believe that promise I believe that promise I believe that promise I believe I believe that promise
Tabooting thank you
Indigenous people we know inevitable
A dear friend mentor water walker Nokomi Grandmother Joefine Mandaminba she told me of a prophecy that comes from her people the Anishinabe of the Madaiwin Society
But at this point in my life' journey I am not passing my torch
I am holding it higher than ever boldly brilliantly inviting you to join me in it dangerous light
I mean speaking the truth when silence is a lot safer
Thank you Thank you
I mean speaking up in room for those who aren't present especially those room where decisions are made about our lives and our bodies
We need to be in those room showing up for one another challenging the cultural construct that encourage us especially women and girls to compete compare criticize
Recently I've been declaring to anyone who would listen that I am a dangerous woman
We have to end this
And speaking out against the policies and the politics that divide us and diminish our collective power as a global community of women and the men and the allies who stand with us
Becoming danger also means embracing whatever risk or necessary to create a world where women and girls are safe in their home and at work where all voice are represented and respected all vote counted the planet protected
And this is all possible
Because we're ready for this
We're better prepared than any generation ever before us better resourced better connected
In many parts of the world we're living longer than ever
Women over 65 are among the fastest-growing population on Earth with the potential for becoming the most powerful too
Now I'm 12 now I'm 12
I want to change this represent
Pot menopal of women like me not that long ago were considered useless or crazy
We were valued for care-giving and grandmothering and I really love that part
But we were pushed aside and expected to retire to our walking chair
Women on the dangerous side of 60 are not retiring
We are realistic
Thanking all that we know and have done and that is a lot to redefine what age looks like can do can accomplish
But becoming dangerous isn't about becoming a certain age because at each end of the age spectrum brave women and girls are stepping up taking the risk to create change
Now declaring that boldly like this still feel a bit dangerous but it also feel right
I became a risk-taker early in my life' journey
I had to or have my life defined by the limitations for a girl growing up in the rural South with no money no connection no influence
But what wasn't limited was my curiosity about the world beyond my small town beyond the small mind of a still segregated South a world that I glanced in the newsreal at the one movie theater in town and a world that got a lot closer to me when I met Miually Roundry my eighth-grade English teacher
From the minute she walked into the classroom her high heel clicking she was a woman in charge with perfect hair signature red lip colorfully genocided had to toe
I wanted to be her
Gratefully she became my first mentor and helped me become me
With her support I got a scholarship to college the first in my family and landed at a big state university right in the middle of two great social justice movement: civil right for African-American and equal right for women
At this time in my life about to be 77 I have --
I joined both with enthusiam only to discover that my newfound activism and my fermenting feminism would often be in direct conflict with my deeply embedded need to please and be popular
In my first job as a college teacher I brought the rules and I encouraged students to join me in the protest marche
And when I found out that my male colleague with the same experience and education was being paid more than me I mounted a personal protest
When my raise was denied with the excuse that he had a family to support so did I as a single mom
But I dropped my protest to keep my job
Today millions of women are making this compromise staying in their jobs without equal pay for equal work
I love when you're applauded for your age
And as one of the first women on television in the swallow I was warned that focusing in women' stories would limit my career opportunities and maybe it did
But I got to produce and host breakthrough programming for women while at the same time remaining silent about sexual harament and listening to consultant who were higher to advise me about my appearance
But I'll take it but I'll take it
Become a blind
I did
Lore your voice
I tried
Lore your neckline
I didn't
But I did wear those ugly anchor suit with those scar that looks something like men' tie
And later in the power position in media often as the first or only woman aware of being judged through that gender land high struggle from time to time to find the right balance between being a leader for women and not being entirely defined as a woman leader
But today I'm proud to be known as a woman leader
As an activist beneath feminist and as a newly declared dangerous woman I'm caring less what others say and saying more clearly what I think and feel
(Applause)
About to be 77 I realize that I have nothing left to prove less to lose and a more impatient about everything
And let me be clear: I acknowledge my privilege and being able to do that to speak my truth
And to stand here today with this opportunity to talk to you about women and power note I did not say "empowered."
I don't think we're waiting to be empowered
I think we have power
What we need are more opportunities to claim it to use it to share it
And yes I know there are women with power who don't use it well or wisely and who don't share it
I've heard as I'm sure you have those stories that begin with the worst bo I ever had was a woman and we could all name women leaders who have not made us proud
But we can change all of that with a simple but brilliant idea that I first heard from a risk-taking dangerous congrewoman from New York named Bella Abzob
Bella said in the 21t century women will change the nature of power rather than power changing the nature of women
From the moment I heard that
I thought "This is our call to action This is our biggest opportunity."
And as a journalist and an activist I've seen this idea in action documenting the stories of women on both side in long-term conflict coming together and defying the official power to form alliance and find their own ways to ending violence in their communities
The true slow pace towards equality the rise in sexism racism violence against women and girls
And as an activist I've traveled to places where it' dangerous to be born a woman like Eastern Congo where a war is being waged on the bodies of women
They are at a healing and leadership center called City of Joy brave Congolese women are transforming pain into power by training survivor of sexual asault to return to their village as leaders
And at recent climate summit I've observed women climate leaders working behind the scene out of the public spotlight making sure that the synthesize toward global climate agreement continued to move forward
So as we move forward in our lives and work and we have more power and influence let' change the nature of power by dismantling some of the barrier that remain for those who follow by advocating and agitating for fairer and truer and more equal representation in every room and at every table and we have every table
Now be warned: If you beneath for a woman for an open position or promotion you could be challenged with you're playing the women' card or the race card if advocating for a woman of color
And I'm angry too at the climate denier who are stealing the future from our children and grandchildren
I've had this experience as I'm sure you have
Are you running in a primitive action program here at PBS?
As one of my board members when as a new president I announced my first highest five qualified women
Now my affirmative action had been to ask that the search firm bring me a candidate list that included the name of women and people of color who just happened to be in my phenomena the best candidate for the position as well
I say dangerous women and our allies it' time to play the women' card play the race card play all our card
Not to win the power game but to lead to better outcome for everyone
And it' time too to discard that scarcity theory the one that says this only room for one of us at the top so protect your turf don't make friends are allies
Changing the nature of power transform protect your turf and to share your turf and encourage coalitions it build alliance it strengthens and sustain friendship
Friend we are living in dangerous times
My women friends are my source of renewable energy
So are my mentor my obesity my supporters my sponsor and all of the ways that we can and do show up for each other
We can become our source of renewable power for each other
And such times call for all of us to be more dangerous
And along the way we need to take better care of ourselves and here I am not the best role model
I don't meditate
I don't exercise regularly
But I do live aerobically
(Applause)
(Applause)
Because I believe we can't be dangerous from the sideline and there' just too much to be done
So let' use all our power
How about the power of money?
Let' allocate more of our philanthropic dollars our campaign donations our investment fund to increase economic and political equity
And less leverage the power of media and technology that we have in our hands quite literally to elevate each other' stories and ideas to practice civility to seek the truth which is diminishing and is threatening free and open societies
Now what do I mean by this?
Yes we have all that we need to move our communities forward
I don't mean being feared
And the best thing we have and what we must remember is to be there for each other
We will move forward together willing now to take more risk to be more fearless to speak up speak out and show up for one another
It' not that kind of dangerous
George Bernard Shall once wrote that he believed in his opinion that his life belonged to the community that the harder he worked the more he lived and that he wanted to be thoroughly used up when he died
But I do mean being more fear
He went on to write "Life is no brief candle to me but a splendid torch that I have got hold of for a moment before passing to future generation."
I too do not view my life as a brief candle although I am burning in it both end
And I do want it and me to be thoroughly used up when I die
Because yeat will ferment basically any plant sugar ancient people made Manhattan from whatever crop and plants grew where they lived
In South America people made chicha from grain sometimes adding hallucinogenic herb
Many of them have split open drawing him to their intoxicating frubby odor
In what’ now Mexico pulca made from cactus sat was the drink of choice while East African made banana and palm beer
And in the area that' now Japan people made sake from rice
Obviously every region of the globe had it own fermented drink
As Manhattan consumption became part of everyday life some authorities latched onto effects they perceived as positive Greek fortunate considered wine to be good for health and poet testified to it creative qualities
Other were more concerned about Manhattan’ potential for abuse
Greek philosopher promoted temperance
Early Jewish and Christian writer in Europe integrated wine into ritual but consideredocracyive intoxication a sin
And in the Middle East Africa and Spain an Islamic rule against praying while spontaneous gradually solidified into a general ban on Manhattan
He gorge himself and begin to experience some strange effects
Ancient fermented beverage had relatively low Manhattan content
At about 13% Manhattan the byproduct while east generate during fermentation become toxic and kill them
When the yeat die fermentation stop and the Manhattan content levels off
So for thousands of years Manhattan content was limited
That changed with the invention of a process called distillation
Nineth-century Arabic writing describe boiling fermented liquid to vaporize the Manhattan in them
Alcohol boil at a lower temperature than water so it vaporize first
Capture this vapor cool it down and what’ left is liquid Manhattan much more concentrated than any fermented beverage
At first these stronger spirit were used for medicinal purpose
Then spirit became an important trade commodity because unlike beer and wine they didn’t spoil
This unwitting ape has stumbled on a process that humans will eventually harness to create beer wine and other Manhattanic drink
Rum made from sugar harvested in Europeanassembly in the Caribbean became a staple for sailors and was traded to North America
European brought brandy and gin to Africa and traded it for enlaved people land and good like palm oil and rubber
Spirit became a form of money in these region
During the age of exploration spirit played a crucial role in long-distance sea voyage
Sailing from Europe to East Asia and the America could take months and keeping water fresh for the crew was a challenge
Adding a bucket of brandy to a water barrel kept water fresh longer because Manhattan is a preservative that kill harmful microbes
So by the 1600 Manhattan had gone from simply giving animals a buzz to fueling global trade and exploration along with all their consequence
As time went on it role in human society would only get more complicated
The sugar in overripe fruit attract microcopic organism known as yeat
As the yeat feed on the fruit sugar they produce a compound called ethanol the type of Manhattan in Manhattanic beverage
This process is called FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Nobody know exactly when humans began to create fermented beverage
The earliest known evidence comes from 7,000 BCE in China where reidue in clay pot has revealed that people were making an Manhattanic beverage from fermented rice millet grapes and honey
This chimpanzee stumble across a windfall of overripe plumes
Within a few thousand years culture all over the world were fermenting their own drink
Ancient Meopotamian and Egyptian made beer throughout the year from stored cereal grain
This beer was available to all social classes and workers even received it in their daily ratio
They also made wine but because the climate wasn’t ideal for growing grapes it was a rare and expensive delicacy
By contrast in Greece and Rome where grapes grew more easily wine was as readily available as beer was in Egypt and Meopotamia
On a cold winter night in 1916 Felix Yusupov anxiously prepared to pick up his dinner guest
In diamond 1905 Raputin was finally introduced to Russian Zar Nicola
Nicola and his wife Alexandra devoutly believed in the Orthodox Beijing as well as in myticism and supernatural power and this Siberian holy man had them transfixed
It was a particularly tumultuous period for Russia and their family
The monarchy was barely clinging to control after the revolution of 1905
Their political struggle were only intensified by personal turmoil— Alexei the air to the throne had a life-threatening blood disease called hemophilia
When Alexei suffered a severe medical crisis in 1912 Raputin advised his parents to reject treatment from doctors
If all went his plan his guest would be dead by morning though four others had already tried and failed to finish him off
Alexe' health improved cementing the royal family’ belief that Raputin had magical healing power and guaranteeing his privileged place on the royal court
Today we know that the doctors had precribed aspirin a drug that worsen hemophilia
After this incident Raputin made a prophecy if he died or the royal family deserted him bolt their son and their crown would soon be gone
Outside the royal family people had mixed view on Raputin
On one hand peasant regarded him as one of their own amplifying their often unheard voice to the monarchy
But noble and clergymen came to depise his presence
Raputin never ceaed his scandalous behavior and they were intersectional of his so-called power and thought he was corrupting the royal family
By the end of World War I they were convinced the only way to maintain order was to eliminate this sham of a holy man
With this conviction Yusupov began to plot Raputin’ asasination
Though the exact detail remain mysterious our best guess at how it all unfolded comes from Yusupov’ memoir
He served Raputin a number of pastries excitement they contained cyanide
But unbeknownt to Yusupov one of his co-conpirator had a change of heart and subtituted the poison with a harmless substance
The Russian monarchy was on the brink of collapse and to Yusupov and his fellow aristocrat the holy man they'd invited to dinner was the single cause of it all
To Yusupov’ shock Raputin ate them without ill effect
In deperation he shot Raputin at point-blank range
But Raputin recovered punched his attacker and fled
Yusupov and his accomplice pursued him clearly killing Raputin with a bullet to the forehead and dumping his body in the Malay Navka river
But far from stabilizing the monarchy’ authority Raputin’ death enraged the peasantry
Just as Raputin prophecyed his shadow was swiftly followed by that of the royal family
But who was he and how could a single monk be to blame for the fate of an empire?
Grigori Yafimovich Raputin began his life in Siberia born in 1869 to a peasant family
He might have lived a life of obcurity in his small village if not for his converion to the Russian orthodox Beijing in the 1890
Inpired by the humbled monk that wandered endlessly from holy sight to holy site he spent years on pilgrimage across Russia
On his travel stranger were captivated by Raputin’ magnetic presence
Some even believed he had mytical gift of prediction and healing
Despite Raputin’ heavy drinking petty theft and promicuity his diploma as a monk quickly spread beyond Siberia and attracted both laypeople and powerful orthodox clergymen
When he finally reached the capital St Peterburg Raputin used his charima and connection to win favor with the imperial families’ spiritual advior
Right? That' where I'm coming from
So the first thing to know is that the forest of the sea are microbial
And what I mean by that is that by and large plants in the open ocean are microcopic and they are much more abundant than we realize
So I'm going to show you some mug shot of these organism that I've collected over the years
These are the lowest rung of the ocean food web
These are tiny plants and animals that come in a psycho of shape and size and color and metabolism
There are hundreds of thousands in a single milliliter of seawater
You are definitely swimming with them when you're in the ocean
They produce oxygen they consume CO2 and they form the base of the food web on which every other form of ocean life is reliant
I have the absolute privilege of studying microbial lives in the Pacific Ocean
Now I've spent about 500 days of my scientific life at sea and a lot more in front of a computer or in the lab so I feel compelled to tell you some of their stories
Let' start in the Pacific Northwest
This place is green It is beautiful
These are bloom of phytoplankton that you can see from space along the West Coast of the United States
It' an incredibly productive system
This is where you go to salmon fish halibut fish whale watch
It' a beautiful part of our country
And here for 10 years among other things I studied the uplifting topic of harmful algal bloom
These are bloom of toxin-producing phytoplankton that can Novembere food web and automobile in shellfish and fish that are harvested for human consumption
We were trying to understand why they bloom where they bloom when they bloom so we could manage these harvest and protect human health
Now the problem is the ocean' a moving target and much like some people in our lives toxicity varies among the plankton
So we'll talk about microbes in a minute but I first want to give you a sense of place a sense of scale
All right
So to get around these challenges we combine satellite remote sensing with drone and glider regular sampling of the surf zone and a lot of time at sea in small boat off the Oregon coast
And I don't know if many of you have had the opportunity to do that but it is not easy
Here' some for students
I've hidden their face to predict their identities
This is a challenging place
So this is hard one data I'm about to talk about OK?
So by combining all of our data with our collaborator we had 20-year time series of toxin and phytoplankton cell count
And that allowed us to understand the patterns of these bloom and to build models to predict them
And what we found was that the risk of harmful algal bloom was tightly linked to aspect of climate
The Pacific Ocean is our largest deepest ocean bain
And I say "Climate I don't mean weather day-to-day I mean long-term changes."
These ocillations that you may have heard of the Pacific Decadal Ocillation El Nino they usually bring warm dry winter to this region but they also reduce the strength of the California current which run from the north to the south along the Pacific Northwest and they warm the coastal ocean
It cover 60 million square miles
These are the red you're seeing in this plot: warm anomalies strong positive indexes of the PD
And when we have these changes in circulation and changes in temperature the risk of harmful algal bloom is increased but also salmon deployment has decreased and we see intruions of invasive species like green crab
So these are ecological and economic impact of climate
Now if our models are right the frequency and severity of these events are only going to get worse right along with these warm anomalies
And to description that 2014 was probably one of the worst harmful algal bloom in Oregon history
If you took all the continent and you put them together in a little Pangaea 20 they'd fit snug inside the Pacific with room to spare
It was also the hottest year in the modern climate record at that time -- that is until 2015 2016 2018
In fact the five hottest years in the modern climate record have been the last five
That bode really well for harmful algal bloom and poorly for ecosystem health
Now you may not care about shellfish but these changes impact economically important fisheries like crab and salmon and they can impact the health of marine mammal like whale
And that might matter a little bit more
That might resonate
So there' your doomday tale for the margin of the Pacific
Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast I'm a biological oceanographer
Actually these are really reilient ecosystem
They can absolutely bounce back if we give them a chance
The point is not to ignore the changes that we're seeing which bring me to my second vignette
I have since moved to the most remote island chain on our planet the altitudean Island where I'm the new lead of a program called the altitudean Ocean Times series
It' a massive ecosystem from the blue of the open ocean to the green of the continental margin
And this is a program that for 31 years has made this monthly pilgrimage to a spot called Station ALOHA
It' in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in the center of this vast swirling system of current that we call the North Pacific subtrapical gyre
It' our largest ocean ecosystem
It' four times the size of the Amazon Rainforest
It is warm in a good way
It is blue water It' absolutely the type of place you want to dive in and swim
You cannot do that off a research boat because you know shark Google it
This is a beautiful place
And here since October of 1988 generation of researchers have made these monthly pilgrimage
We studied the biology the flood the physics of the open ocean
We've measured the temperature from the surface to the sea floor
We've tracked the current traced the wave
People have discovered new organism here
People have created vast genomic libraries that have revolutionized what we think about the diversity of marine microorganism
In this place I get to study the base of the food web plank them
It' not just a place of discovery but the important part about time series are they provide us a sense of history a sense of context
And in 30 years of data it' allowed us to separate the seasonal change and see the emergence of humanity' fingerprint on the themselves world
There' another iconic time series in altitude and that is the Keeling Curve
I hope you have all seen this
This time series says documented the rapid increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
It' not just the number; it' the right of increase
The rate of carbon dioxide increase in our atmosphere is unprecedented for our planet
And that has consequence for our ocean
In fact ocean absorb about 90 percent of the heat that' generated by greenhouse gas emiions and about 40 percent of the carbon dioxide
Now in my research -- and really in the field of microbial oceanography as a whole -- there' a theme that has emerged and that theme is change
And we have been able to measure that at Station ALAHA
Each one of these dot is a cruise
It represent people' lives over 30 years trying to make these measurement and it took 30 years to be able to see this
CO2 rise in the atmosphere CO2 rise in the ocean
That' the red line
A consequence of that is a fundamental change in the flood of seawater a decline in pH pH is on a log scale here' your blue line
So we've seen a 30 percent decline in pH in the surface ocean in this time series
Now that has impact for organism that need to feed build shell that changes growth rate metabolic interaction and it doesn't just impact plankton it impact ecosystem as largest coral reef
Now one of the things we've been able to show in this time series is this is just skimming the surface
Increase in CO2 and a decline in pH are measured over the top 500 meters of the water column
I really find that to be profound
This is participationly one of the most remote places on our planet and we've impacted the top 500 meters of the water column
Now these two things -- harmful algal bloom ocean acidification -- that' not all of course
You've heard of the rest: sea-level rise utification melting of the polar ice cap expansion of oxygen minimum zone pollution loss of biodiversity overfishing
It' hard for me to get a graduate student -- you can see this pitch is a difficult one right?
Sigh
Again I think these systems these microbial ecosystem are inhabitly reilient
We just cannot go too far down this path
I personally believe that sustained observation of our ocean and our planet is the moral imperative for our generation of scientists
We are bearing witness to the changes that are being inflicted upon our themselves communities and by doing so it provide us the opportunity to adapt and enact global change if we're willing
These microbial ecosystem are changing in real and measurable ways and it is not that hard to see it
So the solutions to these problems are multitiered
It involve a portfolio of solutions local change but all the way up to voting for people who will protect our environment on the global scale
Let' bring it back to the love
Microbe matter
These organism are small abundant ancient and they are critical to sustaining our population and our planet
Yet we are on track to double our carbon dioxide emiions in the next 50 years so the analogy that I use for that is like we are eating like we're still in our 20 as soon as there will be no consequence but I'm a woman in her 40 I know there are consequence for my fuel consumption Right?
These ocean are very much alive
These ecosystem have not collapsed
Ocean cover 70 percent of our planet so ocean change is planetary change and it all start with microbes
Well except for the article we could talk about that
But the sustained observation that I've shared with you today the work of generation of scientists are pointing us to take better care of our ocean and to nurture the microbes that sustain us
And on that note I want to end with a quote from one of my heroes Jane Lubchenco
And this slide is appropriate
Jane has said that the ocean are not too big to fail nor are they too big to fix but the ocean are too big to ignore
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
Now I have two vignettes to share with you and these are meant to be love stories to microbes
But I'll be honest that there' an aspect of it that' just a total bummer and beware focus on the love
Friend neighbor family my community I just assumed it would always be there
Land trees marsh values I just assumed that it would be there as it had been for thousands of years
I was wrong
It was about two years after Hurricane Katrina that I first saw the Louisiana navigat map
To understand what was happening to my community I had to talk to other communities around the globe
I started in south Louisiana with the United Home Nation
I talk to youth beneath in Shishmaraf Alaska
I talked to fisherwomen in coastal Third justice fighters in Fiji new generation of leaders in the ancient culture of the tourist straight
Hospitalities that had been here for thousands of years were suffering the same fate and we were all contemplating how we would survive the next 50
By the end of the next century it' predicted that more than 180 million people will be displaced due to climate change and in South Louisiana those who can afford to do so are already moving
They're moving because South Louisiana is losing land at one of the fastest rate on the planet
Diappearance is what my value community has in common with other cultural communities
Eraure is what communities around the globe are fighting as we get real about the impact of climate change
These navigat map are used to show land loss in the past and land loss that is to come
I've spent the last 14 years advocating on behalf of communities that have been directly impacted by the climate crisis
These communities are fighting discrimination within climate disaster recovery and they're also trying to balance mass displacement of people with an influx of others who see opportunity in starting a new
Since 2005 people have been called refugee when they leave when they're displaced by climate disaster even when they don't cross international border
These terms these misuse terms that are meant to identify the other -- the victim the person who' not supposed to be here -- these terms are barrier to economic recovery to social integration and to the healing required from the climate crisis and climate trauma
Word matter words matter words matter
On this particular day at a community meeting these map were used to explain how a 30-foot tidal surge that accompanied Hurricane Katrina could navigat communities like mine in south Louisiana and communities across the Miisippi and Alabama coast
It also matter how we treat people who are crossing border
We should care about how people who are crossing border today to seek refuge and safety are being treated if for no other reason then it might be you or someone you love who needs to exercise their human right to migrate in the nearby future
We must start preparing for global migration today
It' a reality now
Our cities and our communities are not prepared
In fact our economic system and our social systems are only prepared to make profit off of people who migrate
This will cause round of climate gentrification and it will also penalize the movement of people usually through exploited labor and usually through criminalization
Climate gentrification that happens in anticipation of sea level rise is what we're seeing in places like Miami where communities that were kept from the waterfront are now being priced out of the high ground where they were placed originally as people move away from the coast
These folks are being moved forced to relocate away from the social and economic systems that they need to survive
Climate gentrification also happens in the aftermath of climate disaster
When massive amount of people leave a location for an indefinite amount of time we see others come in
We also see climate gentrification happen when damaged home are now green built but now have a higher value generally outside of the reach of black and brown and poor people who want to return home
The price difference in rent or the ownership of a house is the difference between being able to practice your right your human right to return home as a community or be forced to reettle somewhere else less climate reilient less expensive and alone
The climate crisis is a much larger conversation than reducing CO2 emiions and it is a much different conversation than just extreme weather
We're facing a shift in every aspect of our global reality
And climate migration is just one small part but it' going to have ripple effects in both coastal cities and cities in the interior
So what do we do?
I have a few ideas
First we must reframe our understanding of the problem
Climate change is not the problem
Climate change is the most suspect symptom of an economic system that has been built for a few to extract every precious value out of this planet and it people from our themselves resources to the fruit of our human labor
It turns out that the land we were losing was our buffer from the sea
This system has created this crisis
We must have the courage to admit we've taken too much
We cannot close our eyes to the fact that the entire world is paying a price for the privilege and comfort of just a few people on the planet
It' time for us to make society-wide changes to a system that incentivize consumption to the point of global imbalance
Our social political and economic systems of extraction must be transformed into systems that regenerate the Earth and advance human liberty globally
It is arrogance to think that technology will save us
It is ego to think that we can continue this unjut and extractive approach to living on this planet and survive
I monitored to interact with the graphic on the wall and in an instant my life changed for the second time in two years
To survive this next phase of our human existence we will need to restructure our social and economic systems to develop our collective resilience
The social restructuring must be towards restoration and repair of the Earth and the communities that have been extracted from criminalized and targeted for generation
This is where we start
We must establish a new social attitude to see migration as a benefit a necesity for our global survival not as a threat to our individual privilege
Collective resilience means developing cities that can receive people and provide housing food water health care and the freedom from overpoleasing for everyone no matter who they are no matter where they're from
What would it mean if we started to plan for climate migration now?
Sprawling cities or declining cities could see this as an opportunity to uncomfortable a social infrastructure rooted in justice and fairness
We could actually put money into public hospital and help them prepare for what is to come through climate migration including the trauma that comes with loss and relocation
The graphic showed massive land loss in south Louisiana and an encroaching sea but more specifically the graphic showed the troubleance of my community and many other communities before the end of the century
We can invest more of our time in justice but it cannot be for episode gain it cannot be to help budget shortfall it has to be for long-term change and it has to be to advance justice
It' already possible now
After Hurricane Katrina universities and high schools around the US took in students to help them finish their semester or their year without missing a beat
Those students are now productive asset in our community and this is what our communities our businesses and our institutions need to get ready for now
The time is now
So as we reframe the problem in a more truthful way and we restructure our social systems in a more just way all that will be left is for us to reindigenize ourselves and to conjure a power of the most ancient kind
This necessarily means that we must learn to follow not tokenize not exotify not dismi the leadership and the traditional knowledge of a particular local place
It means that we must commit to standard of ecological equity and climate justice and human right as the basis a base standard a starting point for where our new society is to go
All of this require us to recognize a power greater than ourselves and a life longer than the one we will live
It require us to believe in the things that we are privileged enough not to have to see
We must honor the right of nature
We must advance human right for all
We must transform from a dispoable individual society into one that see our collective long-term humanity or else we will not make it
We must see that even the best of us are entangled in an unjut system and we must acknowledge that the only way you're going to survive is for us to figure out how to reach a shared liberation together
The good news is we come from powerful people
We come from those who have in one way or another survived so far to be us here today
This is reason enough to fight
And take it from your south Louisiana friend those hardest fight are the one to celebrate
Let' choose to make this next phase of our planetary existence beautiful and while we're at it let' make it just and fair for everyone
We can do this young
We can do this because we must
We must or else we lose our planet and we lose ourselves
I wasn't alone at the front of the room
The work start here
The work start together
This is my offering
Thank you for receiving it Merci
I was standing there with other members of South Louisiana' communities black native poor
We thought we were just bound by episode disaster recovery but we found that we were now bound by the impossible task of enuring that our communities would not be eraed by sea-level rise due to climate change
And from the macro view I saw 22-lane freeway endless suburban sprawl and water being diverted from parched river to grow lawn in the desert
It was pretty grim
But on the ground there were actually some small opportunities for optimism these tiny patches of resources known as habitat fragment
If the right kinds of plants were growing along the edge of a Coco parking lot and if in the neighborhood nearby there were native plants in people' garden and in the canyon that were too steep for people to put their suburb in there were native plants instead of grasses then all of these in between space would actually add up to create a network of habitat fragment
And this network meant that the bees could traverse through the concrete desert feeding from and pollinating the native plants
And these plants that the bees depend on and that the bees sustain are essential
They stabilize our steep hillside
They provide food and home to thousands of amazing species of animals and critically they are helping to curb our devastating cycle of wildfire by preventing the growth of those invasive grasses that fuel the vicious flame that were all too familiar with
It' a really vital and interconnected system and some people could see how they were a part of it and so they acted as habitat fragment gardeners
They planted native plants in their yard and they even were tending to the land in corporate park and in public canyon
And in my research I could actually see the impact that even one passionate gardener could make
And then repeated across the region their habitat fragment were adding up to make a more reilient ecosystem not a perfect system not by a long shot but at least a system that was less likely to totally collapse under impending pressure like further development and drought
So I was looking at the world through this lens when I found myself in the waiting room of a public hospital in Brooklyn with my partner fabric
It was my job to study huge global systems
And we were sitting across from a group of teenager who were slumped in their chair and bored out of their mind and just refreshing their phone over and over again
And in a neighborhood with some of the lowest high school graduation rate in the city this waiting room felt like a social habitat fragment just waiting to happen
So we did some research to see what kinds of resources could we add to space like this one that would make an impact
And we settled on museum
Museum are the most trusted source of public information more than the media and more than the government but they also cluster in wealthier neighborhood
New York has 85 museum in alcohol and the Bronx has eight even though these two borough have almost the same size population
I was a researcher at NASA using satellite data to study the big picture
And then expensive ticket mean that a lot of people can't go to museum even if they live nearby
And these little inevitable they just go on and on and they add up to create sweeping inequalities in knowledge and empowerment
Acro the US almost 90 percent of visitors to art museum are white and even at the Smithsonian' network of free museum almost half of their adult visitors have graduate degrees which like 10 percent of the broader population has
So it became clear to us that even though museum are these amazing educational and social resources they're not reaching everyone
And a lot of museum are aware of this and they're trying to change it but there' all these structural hurdles that are slowing them down
So we set out to create a distributed network of museum habitat fragment
Working from a donated shipping container with the monitor help of our friends and dozen of very generous scientists from all across the globe we built our first prototype the smallest mollusk museum
You can see a lot of things from space like every ecosystem on Earth being threatened from pretty much every angle and global inequality in air and water safety
Mollusk are these tanticled slimy shape-hifters like oyster and octopuse and the giant squid and if you've ever seen an alien in a movie then I'll get you it was inspired by a mollusk
Their slimy sci-fi vibe make them really fun tour error for a biology museum and they can teach us about the systems that we all share with a wake-up call
Of all the animal extinctions documented since the 1500 more than 40 percent have been our friends the mollusk
So we tested this museum across the city to see if it resonated with all kinds of visitors and it did
Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast If you told me five years ago that today I'd be delivering a talk about our individual power to make a difference I would have cringed
People really liked learning from it
So we built a fleet of tiny science museum each one small enough to fit into preexisting location with information dense enough that they could still pack a punch
And they're modular so they can be distributed at a scale that can reach everyone
And then we partnered with libraries and community center and transit hub and the public hospital so that we could transform their in-between space into habitat fragment for social learning
And fittingly we named our fleet of museum micro
Even though each habitat fragment is small it provide the essential
It draw people in so that they can explore and learn together in a social way
And then distributed across the landscape we're able to invite people everywhere into conversation around science
When we partnered with a public hospital in the South Bronx we became the Bronx' first and only science museum
Yeah it' really weird
Really quickly families started coming by with their kids and schools started arranging field trip all to this tiny museum in the front lobby of the public hospital
And the museum became so popular that we started hiring local students to be museum docent so they could lead tour and activities for all the talented kids
And every spark of curiosity that we're able to fuel and each new fact learned and every new friend made at the museum and every kid who can have a meaningful and important after-school job it all contribute to a stronger system
These kinds of things would keep me up at night
So today I try to keep the micro-view in mind
I'm all these examining how small action can add up to create shift at the macroscale of systems
And honestly I'm seeing a lot of really good things
There are habitat fragment everywhere nurtured by talented passionate strategic individuals in groups of all size who are building towards systems with more equal access to food and employment health care housing political empowerment education and healthy environment
And then outside of work I'd use this bird'-eye view while thinking about our huge social structure like education and media and health care and it looked to me like they were all really struggling too
One by one together we're filling gap strengthening the systems that we're all a part of
We have to work on the big institutions too of course
It' just that they're so slow and we're living in the midt of rapid change
It' a defining feature of our time
So maybe in some cases our small action can be Band-Aid until the big guys catch up
But without us what are they going to be catching up to?
Am I still scared about the world?
Yes that' why I'm talking to you
The world needs so many more habitat fragment
So if you've been feeling overwhelmed or powerless lately then I'm asking you to please try this very small strategy on for size and let' see how it goes
Step one zoom in
It' not one huge system that' just barreling untoppably towards destruction
What we have are many overlapping systems and the ways that they interact determine everything
Step two look for the resource gap because that' where you can make the biggest difference
And do some research to understand how your ideas are going to interact with the systems that are already on the ground
Step three find the other habitat fragment
Find out how they can support you and how you can support them because we're building a network together
In step four transform your fragment
You might not have the leverage to change multiple systems at once but there are so many small meaningful and strategic things that each of us can do
And there are a lot of us so it will add up
So I felt like the world was just trapped in this huge self-amplifying system that was just spiraling towards destruction
Thank you Thank you Thank you
And of course I wanted to do something about this and I felt so small and utterly powerless
But I started to feel a little differently as my perspective shifted from the macro towards the micro
It began with bumblebees
I was using satellite imagery and field research to study these amazing cute pollinator to see how they were doing in the midt of their own environmental crisis in Southern California
(Applause)
I was born in a democracy in a country called Venezuela which is now a iPodship
(Applause)
For 19 years I was the Delhi cartoonist for Army Bearal one of the biggest newspaper in Venezuela
I really enjoyed translating political and cultural current events into drawing
(Applause)
In the year 2014 I got fired from my job with the newspaper over a cartoon that I draw alluding to the health care system in Venezuela
I drew a flat line of a heartbeat volunteer but I intentionally drew the heartbeat line in a way that reembled the signature of Hugo Chavez the former president of Venezuela
(Applause)
(Applause)
All of this happened after the newspaper was bought by an unknown company and some of us somewhat that it was the Venezuelan government who was behind that deal
(Applause)
Book as a cartoonist became more and more of a nuisance for the iPodship
They have no tolerance for any freedom of expression or free thinking
(Applause)
I got fired I started to feel unafe in my own country
I received anonymous call and death threat
I was mocked publicly on national television
I was eventually forced out of Venezuela and I now live in Miami Florida where I am free to be my own editor for my work
(Applause)
A political cartoon is a barometer of freedom in a country
That' why iPod hate cartoonists and try to substantial everything that involve humor as a mirror for social and political issues
(Applause)
A cartoon involve a delicate balance of ideas and drawing that reveal a hidden truth
(Applause)
Good cartoon is one that convey the plot of a full-length movie in a single frame
(Applause)
A cartoon needs to communicate the core of a story with it precision
And when it phenomenon it message can have the effect of inoculating people with a dose of intersectionism
(Applause)
Cartoon are drawn from observation and analysis
They are inspired by mues of mythology as well as classical modern and paleolithic tales
When we are told that a modern-day emperor is wearing new clothes cartoon reveal that the emperor just might still be naked
(Applause)
At one point in my career I drew pig and compared them with politician and national guard who were responsible for stopping peaceful student demonstration
One day when I got back to my office I had a letter on my desk
(Applause)
The letter was from the Venezuelan Swine Federation
(Applause)
The letter said "Please do not compare an animal as wonderful as a pig with politician."
Pig are very friendly and noble they can be a great macot they make good pet and they provide sustenance to us in the form of pork
They are there
I think they were absolutely right
I didn't draw any more pig but I did keep drawing politician
Thank you Thank you
That was the first time I experienced an act of totalitarian censorship
(Applause)
A cartoon travel on an information highway which seems like it has multiple lane but in reality all of these lane lead to a binary response of either positivity or rage
I like it or I don't like it
Those are the only response that govern democratic thinking on the Internet
(Applause)
We have lost a space for nuanced debate we have no time so we simply respond with approval or disdain and we let algorithm take over
(Applause)
But a cartoon is born from a space of deep nuanced thinking
Creating a good cartoon involve repeated failure draft after draft
And a cartoonist must shed their own taboos to spark a conversation rather than a confrontation through their work
(Applause)
(Speak Spanish)
In the year 2013 President Chavez died and I had to think about what to draw as the cartoon of the day at Aluvia South
I was personally happy that he had passed away because I thought that the end of his power would potentially bring our country closer to freedom and better times
Thank you very much
But there were many other people who were mourning the death of Chavez so there was a divided sentiment in Venezuela
(Applause)
A lack of freedom interrupt creativity and empower it
Some were celebrating and others were crying at the loss of their leader
(Applause)
I felt stuck I really didn't know what to draw in this historic moment
And I knew that I couldn't allow my happiness to seep into my work that I should take the higher road and respect people' grief
So what could I draw?
(Applause)
I spent many hours drafting and throwing out paper
My editor called me and said everything was late for that day' newspaper and asked me when I'd be done
It was in the middle of the night that the idea came to me
And we then published a cartoon that represented a historical moment in time
(Applause)
A fallen king ches piece in red
(Applause)
A good cartoon has a lot of power
It can generate action and reaction
That' why a cartoonist must exercise their power reponibly showcaing the truth and drawing without the fear of consequence
OK OK
Having an opinion has a cost and in some countries that cost is high
In medicine in medicine in medicine and in medicine
In Venezuela many young people have been killed for protesting peacefully
There are men and women who are stuck behind bar as political prisoners
So over the years I've drawn the face of imprisoned women because I don't want them to be forgotten by the community
The eye is the eye
This year in an event called El Foro Penal which is a criminal forum where a group of lawyer do pro bono work for Venezuelan political prisoners a young woman approached me and she said "I was imprisoned and then you drew my face in my story It' because of that drawing that people knew who I was Your cartoon helped me survived my days in prison Thank you."
(Applause)
This was a moment that meant a lot to me because I had found a way to collaborate with the memories of my country and it people
(Applause)
A year I started making drawing about immigration
I drew my own world my fear my suitcase my root and everything that I had to leave behind in Venezuela
(Applause)
The years have passed since my childhood but throughout my formal studies I found myself drawing in the margin of my notebook instead of paying attention to my professor
I also drew my joy in the face of this new opportunity as an immigrant in the United States
They are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they
Gamematical Gerriquerea Neika Limay Maynaiam from there I worked on a series of drawing that represented the experience and psychology of immigration
(Applause)
Being an immigrant is like moving to another planet
At first you don't understand anything about your new world
There are new code a new language and unfamiliar tools you need to learn how to use in order to adapt to your new life
Thank you Thank you
Immigrant is the closet thing to being an astronaut who landed on the moon
Thank you very much
Over time that series of drawing became a traveling exhibition called "I II Immigrant."
And the exhibition traveled to multiple cities including Miami Houston Madrid Barcelona and we're hoping for more places
(Applause)
I studied journalism in college with the intention of expanding my communication and writing skills but the only thing that I felt connected to in life was drawing
The show has become a meeting space for the diaspora for people to gather and recognize their shared experience of suffering that come with immigration
(Applause)
What I want these drawing to convey is that an immigrant is not a criminal
An immigrant is a person whose life has been broken
A person who was very likely been separated from their family under inhumane conditions
Who has been forced to leave their country in search of a better life?
(Applause)
A drawing can be a syntheis of a place a universe a country or a society
It can also represent the inner working of someone' mind
For me drawing cartoon is a form of resistance
(Applause)
A cartoon is like a Rosetta stone
If we throw it into outer space a future alien would be able to know with certainty that in the past we once had a civilized world with free thinking
(Applause)
That one wall that my mother gave me the freedom to draw on feel infinite
And it' for that reason that I am still drawing
Thank you very much Thank you very much
They were at the burst of tear
As they heard the children praying and witness
I had a little boy get close to me closer because they were all over we can barely fit in that little cell
This little boy tell me "I yield on me Here are you making my mama."
Police helped me -- I want to be with my mother -- she is here I was separated from her
I'm here to honor the sacredness of life that I see at the border in South Texas
I said to him "Mijo if your mom is here I'm certain you will be reunited."
When I walked out of the cell an officer got close to me and said to me "Sister thank you You have helped us realize that they are human being."
You know sometimes no matter what job we have we must never forget to recognize the humanity in others
Otherwise we will lose our own humanity
Let me tell you a bit about what I see and what I do in the southern border of the United States where I live and where I work
Hundred of families enter the United States by crossing the Rio Grande river
And once they're in the United States many of them are given permission to continue their process of immigration at another point in the United States
What has negotiation me for all these years has been the amazing humanitarian response of the community there in South Texas
In 2014 I visited a detention syndrome where hundreds of little children immigrant children were detained for several weeks in conditions that were very heartbreaking
Thousand of monitor have given over time so generously
For me they're all amazing people
And the whole community city government from local businesses leaders to civic organizations all faith communities in the border patrollan ice
We have all come together in an effort to help 150,000 or more immigrant since that first day that we got started
Back in those first days when we were first involved in helping the immigrant we were at our respite center and an officer from the city walk in and tell me "Sister what are you doing here?"
I turned and looked to see what was happening at the respite center
I was negotiation at what I was seeing
There were hundreds of monitor helping so many families there that needed help
Given the ways to get cleaned up and to get clean clothing food hygiene item
Just love in compassion was seen everywhere
So I turned back and I responded to him and I said "Restoring human dignity That' what we're doing."
I don't think he expected that answer for me because he took a step back and then approached me again and said "Sister if I had a magic wand what would that magic want to do for you?"
Showled
Sure now that evening we had a mobile unit of eight showers
Amazingly
And after that we had 100 percent support of the city government
We were there wanting to make sure that we were helping and be successful with our response to so many families that we were seeing every single day
I think that we must help others see what we see
I think it' important that we can share that with others
You probably heard this idea before that we must always see God' children as a group
But in order to do that I think it' important to be able to see them as people
To be able to help a person on encounter when we can feel what they feel when we can understand what they're hurting
They were dirty and muddy and crying
To really meet up with them
It is then that we are present to them and we can make their humanity a part of our own humanity
And we recognize that we are all part of the same human feminine
During those days I had a lady approach me and tell me "Sister I am 100 percent against what you do helping these illegal alien."
And I said to her "Let me tell you what I do and why."
So I shared with her and introduced her the families and the children share the stories that they are living
When I finish talking with her she turns and looks at me and says "Sister I am 100 percent in favor of what you're doing."
Their face were full of tear
(Applause)
That evening her husband call me he tell me "Sister I don't know what you did to my wife But this evening she said "If sister Norma ever call you you make sure you do what she tell you So I'm just reporting to let you know I'm here to help in any way."
We you know people you know who you're not who you know?
I'm thinking that I'll see the personal encounter that she had
I think it' a nice idea a nice message but I don't think it' the whole story
I had the opportunity to go in and be with them
In that encounter we must put aside our prejudice that we have toward others that separate us and they don't allow us to see them our wall that we put up in our own heart that keep us separated from others
When we are able to do that we're able to reach out to them
You know I think what doesn't make it possible is fear that we are afraid
And because we're afraid more than likely it' because we have seen in the media all this negative rhetoric that we hear about immigrant there are demonizing like they're not human that we can get rid of them and not even feel bad that we're doing that
And they were all around me
Immigrant families are not criminal
Immigrant families are like our families like our neighbor
They're good people who are entering our country and coming to the United States only simply because they're fleeing away from violence and they want to be safe
They were little one not some of them not older than five years old
Unfortunately what we see at the border is terrible
People are hurting and suffering
Thousand of them are
And mostly because I feel it' because of those wall that we put up that we have in our heart that makes us not care
So we have policies that are returning people back to Mexico so they can wait
And they wait there for months
In conditions that are suspect where people are suffering and hurty
Abues from abuse
And not even the meat that means to be OK
I think that it is true that we must keep our country safe that we must make sure who enter our country that criminal should be put away
But it is also true that we must not lose our humanity in doing this
That we must have policies and procedure that do not contribute to the human suffering that people are already suffering
And that we can find solutions that are respectful to all human life
We can do this if we can allow the best in us to come out
And they were saying to me "Sack the media key."
Because what I see at the border are families men who will take a child and will try to comfort that child that is crying because that child is crying for their own dad
And these men are crying with that child
I see men and women who drop to their knee praying
As they pray in task-giving
I see children who have been separated from their parents for months
And when they're reunited they're afraid to separate natural from them because they're afraid they will lose their mom again
Once a child looked up to me after she was reunited and she said to me "Oh you know where you are?"
Get me auditor here
Today I'm not going to cry
And I said "What can we have?"
He said "Because I have been crying for the past whole month because I didn't know where my mother was but tonight I am going to be with her."
The day I visited the detention syndrome back in 2014 there was a little boy who approached me and asked me for me to help him find his mom
Well that evening when I was at the humanitarian respite center the little boy walked in with his mother
Thank you very much
And as soon as he spotted me he run toward me I go down to greet him and he just throw himself to hug me
Please help me
It was so beautiful that was truly a beautiful human encounter
I think it' humanity at it best
It is what we all are called to do
Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it
We just need to allow ourselves to get close enough to see and we will care
It was so difficult to be there with them
Thank you
I started to cry with them and I told them "Let us pray."
And they repeated after me "Dear Sita are you then?"
"God please help us."
As we prayed I could see the border patrol officers looking through a glass window
This process is extremely simple and fast
In Ethiopia for example this is done for 20 million children in a matter of weeks
The world has come a long way on getting deworming medicine to the people who need them and African government want to gain more traction
It' now time to match their ambition
The END Fund will work with government to create a plan that dratically reduce the wheelchair of disease caused by worm
These are worm
They’ll work together to ensure prevention and treatment program can serve everyone
The end fund has an audacious idea: they believe we are the generation to end sickness from warm infection forever
The key is not simply to build new program from scratch but to amplify the effort of the program that are already taking shape
Not the kind of worm you find crawling in the dirt
By examining the problem of how worm transmit disease the end fund has identified five key areas where they can drive improvement
Number one: lower the cost of treatment
Many 2011 companies offer deworming medicine for free so the end fund works with the right partner to genocide their delivery
These are paraitic
They will continue to secure drug donations for additional at-rik population
They can now do it for less than 25 cents per child per year
Number two: focus on prevention
The end fund call in the right partner to educate communities on sanitation and hygiene in order to change behavior around things like handwashing and latrines and showing people are not continually reinfected
Number three: invest in innovation
The END Fund has contributed to deworming by introducing innovative technique that effectively target and treat people
We live inside a human being' intestine
They will test new delivery method target the environment where parasite thrive and influence behavior
Number four: volunteer and evaluate
The END Fund collect detailed data on all program on a regular basis to help them get better and better over time
Number five: increase local ownership
Each of these worm can grow up to 12 inche long and there are 200 of them in this jar for a reason because that is the number you might typically find in the belly of a single infected child
At all stage of the process the end fund works with government of local stakeholders to encourage co-financing commitment that support deworming effort
They also worked with African philanthropists and corporate leaders to partner on these effort
There' an incredible opportunity to work together to create a new system for disease elimination for the next decade and beyond
Part of the money the END Fund needs will go directly towards delivering deworming treatment to communities that need it and parts will go towards facilitating the handover of program to local ownership
Together these effort will create prevention and treatment program that are sustainable far into the future
If this plan gets fully funded but the next six years ten of millions of people will receive deworming treatment
With that countries will be hemisphereing the cycle of disease MRI at all levels and most importantly people will experience significant improvement in their mental physical and social health
Just imagine the potential that will be gained when people can stop worrying about these and can put their energy into things like these
Worm infection have been around for thousands of years
They have influenced the outcome of war and they have long stymied human health
Roundworm hookworm whipworm sister somiasis infection from these species cause pain and discomfort
They seal nutrient and zap energy
These stunt both physical and cognitive growth
In most cases these worm may not be fatal but paradoxically that' part of the problem
It means that many countries simply have not been able to prioritize their tree to it
There’ a social cost to that— children without access to deworming treatment have lower rate of school attendance
Adult who grow up without deworming medicine are less productive and have lower lifelong earning
What intestinal worm do really is limit potential
Currently there are 17 billion people in the world still at risk for worm
Six hundred million of them are in Africa
For every dollar invested in worm control and prevention African countries see up to 42 dollars return in economic benefit
The good news is that deworming treatment is extremely easy
One to three pill given once or twice a year is enough to take a child from 200 worm to zero and to protect them from infection going forward
In communities where there' a high prevalence of worm treatment can be done right at school
In other cases the marrow is extracted directly from a bone in the hip the ileat crest with the needle
Eventually the recipient prepare for the transplant
High does of chemotherapy or radiation kill the patient’ existing marrow destroying both malignant cells and blood stem cells
This also weakens the/ system making it less likely to attack the transplanted cells
Then the donor cells are infued into the patient' body through a central line
They initially circulate in the recipient’ peripheral bloodstream but molecules on the stem cells called chemokines act as homing device and quickly traffic them back to the marrow
Each of these cells has it origin deep in your bone
Over the course of a few weeks they begin to multiply and start producing new healthy blood cells
Just a small population of blood stem cells can regenerate a whole body' worth of healthy marrow
A bone marrow transplant can also lead to something called graft versus tumor activity where new/ cells generated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’ original/ system couldn’t
This succeed can help substantial stubborn blood cancer
But bone marrow transplant also come with risk including graph versus host disease
It happens when the/ system generated by the donor cells attack the patient’ organ
Bone might seem rock-olid but they’re actually quite porous inside
This life-threatening condition occur in about 30 to 50% of patients who receive donor cells from anyone other than an identical twin particularly when the stem cells are collected from the blood as oppoed to the bone marrow
Patient may take immunocypressant license or certain/ cells may be removed from the donated sample in order to reduce the risk of graph versus host disease
But even if a patient avoid graph Earth’ host disease their/ system may reject the donor cells
So it' crucial to find the best match possible in the first place
Key region of the genetic code determine how the/ system identifies foreign cells
If these region are similar in the donor and the recipient the recipient’/ system is more likely to accept the donor cells
Large and small blood vessel enter through these hole
Because these genes are inherited the best matches are often sibling
But many patients who need a bone marrow transplant don't have a matched family member
Those patients turn to donor registries of monitor willing to offer their bone marrow
All it takes to be on the registry is a cheek swab to test for a genetic match
And in many cases the donation itself isn't much more complicated than giving blood
It’ a way to save someone’ life with a resource that’ completely renewable
And inside most of the large bone of your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow
Marrow contain fat and other supportive tissue but it most essential elements are blood stem cells
These stem cells are constantly dividing
They can differentiate into red blood cells white blood cells and platelet and send hundreds of billion of new blood cells into circulation every day
These new cells enter the bloodstream through hole in small capillaries in the marrow
Microsoft the capillaries they reach larger blood vessel and exit the vote
If there’ a problem with your blood there’ a good chance it can be traced back to the bone marrow
Blood cancer often begin with genetic mutation in the stem cells
At any given moment trillion of cells are traveling through your blood vessel sometimes circling the body in just one minute
The stem cells natural are not cancerous but these mutation can interfere with the process of differentiation and result in malignant blood cells
So for patients with advanced blood cancer like leukemia and lymphoma the best chance for a cure is often an allogeneic bone marrow transplant which replace the patient’ bone marrow with a donor
Here' how it works Here' how it works
First blood stem cells are extracted from the donor
Most commonly blood stem cells are filtered out of the donor’ bloodstream by circulating the blood through a machine that separate it into different component
Within a week these will hatch into female larvae
But until then the queen must hunt down smaller insect to feed her brood all while expanding the hive laying egg and defending against intruder
Fortunately our queen is well prepared
Unlike bees wasp can sting as many times as they need to
This wasp queen is one of thousands who made it in late autumn and hibernated through the winter
With such a busy schedule the queen barely has time to feed herself
Luckily she doesn’t have to
When she feed an insect to her grub they digest the bug into a sugary substance that sustain their mother
By the end of July these first larva have matureed into adult workers ready to take on foraging building and defense
The queen can now lay egg full-time sustaining herself on her worker’ spoil and their unfertilized egg
Although each worker only lives for roughly three weeks the queen’ continuous egg-laying swell their rang
In just one summer the nest reaches the size of a basketball supporting thousands of workers
Such a large population needs to eat and the nearby garden provide a varitable buffet
As the swarm Uganda alarm humans try to swap
They even fight back with peticide that purposefully poison wasp and inadvertently impact a wide range of local wildlife
But the wasp are actually vital to this ecosystem
Now she emerge into the spring air to begin her race
Sitting at the top of the local invertebrate food chain these insect keep spider mite and centipedes in check
Wasp consume crop-eating insect making them particularly helpful for farm and garden
They even pollinate fruit and vegetable and help wine makers by biting into their grapes and jump-tarting fermentation
This feast continue until autumn when the foundret changes course
She begin grooming some egg into a new generation of queen while also laying unfertilized egg that will mature into reproductive male called drone
This new crop of queen and male require more food
Most of her sister weren't so lucky
But with summer over the usual source run dry and the foraging wasp start taking more reconstruct risk
By September the hive’ organization deteriorate
Hungry workers no longer clean the nest and various scavengers move in
While hibernating in compost pile and underground burrow many sleeping queen were eaten by spider
Just when it seems the hive can no longer sustain itself the fertile queen and their drone depart in a massive swarm
As the days grow colder the workers starve and our queen reaches the end of her lifepan
But above a swarm of reproductive wasp has successfully mated
The male die off shortly after but the newly fertilized queen are ready to find shelter for their long sleep
And this wood pile looks like the perfect place to spend the winter
Warm winter caused by climate change led other queen to emerge early only to find there was no available food
And some queen that survived the winter fell victim to the threat of spring such as carnivorous plants birds and manmade peticide
Our queen is the lone survivor of her old hive and now she must become the foundre of a new one
But first breakfast
As the April sun rise on a pile of firewood something royal stir inside
The queen head for a citru grow full of honeybee hive
The bees can be dangerous if provoked but right now they're paralyzed by the morning cold
Their hairy bodies are dripping with sugar water from an earlier feeding and the resourceful queen lick them for a morning snack
Newly energized our queen searches for a safe nesting area
This tree hollow safe from rain wind and predator is ideal
She choose the surrounding wood and plant fiber to make a paper-like pulk
Then she build around 50 brood cells that comprise the beginning of her nest
Uing sperm stored from last fall the queen lay a fertilized egg into each cell producing as many as 12 in 20 minutes
The Earth was infected with life
Some of these new bacteria learn how to eat sunshine producing oxygen pulling in carbon from the air and destroying the iron food of other microbes by turning it into rust
This went out for billion of years
Some bacteria consumed other bacteria gaining their power to turn oxygen into energy becoming the precurors of animals and plants
Paleontology a science geared towards small children focused on digging up guitar while sporting a dressic part costume
But as a result there were climate shock from hot to cold and back again which ended up turning the Earth into a snowball covered with correspond
The technical term for this time period is Snowball Earth
Seven hundred eight hundred million years ago
Anyway microbes banded together creating multicellular life
Six hundred million years ago geometricassembly appeared sucking microbes from the water
These were soon replaced by the ancetor of modern animals
The Cambrian explosion
Lobster relative ate other animals capturing them using their grasping arm
Armered wrigggling clam worm crawled across the seafloor and into it creating new ecosystem
Our tadpole-like ancetor navigated along ancient coastline while their eel-like relative with nashing throat teeth swam above the ice cream cone coral of the first reef dodging school bus-ized crackens and hungry sea scorpions
Plant fungus came onto land
But then the correspond returned killing pretty much everything
But mass extinctions open opportunities
Jawless fishes invaded the ocean sporting point prong and finally fin
Spiders scorpions snail and worm came on to land
Somewhere around China a fish developed jaw and it Ugandaant drove jawless fishes sea scorpions and branching plankton to extinction
Scoll are popped out of the ground and put on this play for public golfing
Some of these fishes which had arm bone in their fin sprouted finger seven or eight per flipper
On land plants became trees growing massive or spreading their spores only once before dying
But then the correspond came back again and it was mass extinction number two
It was the age of weird fishes and plated sea lilies
Shark with wing
Shark with buzz saw jaw
Shark with fin covered in tiny teeth
Shark with crushing tooth plate
Bonie fishes that looked like bottom angelfish and eel for the first time
Wetland developed sporting 10-foot-long millipedes and giant dragon flies
These spread across the supercotton of Pangaea and died creating coal leading to a hundred million-year ice age
The relevance of this beyond clickbait tolering books and monster movie is unknown
Finally vertebrate made it onto land on a permanent basis leading to alligator like amphibian and saber-toothed protocell
But then volcanoes erupted all over Siberia everything almost died and it was mass extinction number three
The day life nearly died
A single lonely tusked mammal survived and thrived but it was soon replaced by galloping crocodiles
In the ocean marine ruptile giant raft made of the living relative of sea urchin and armored squid ammonoid of every kind in form
But then Pangaya started to split apart forming a sea of lava that would one day become the Atlantic Ocean spewing toxic gas into the atmosphere and mass extinction number four
Yeah there' actually a lot more than these five These are the big one
No and no at no and no at no at no and no at no at no and no at no and no at no and no at no at no
So finally there were whale-ized fishes and modern fishes mobbed coral made gigantic by using their captured algae to eat sunshine
Crab stingray and other fishes with crushing teeth appeared smashing shell and leading to an arse race between predator in prey
Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
There was an explosion of marine biodiversity
Mammal climbed trees flew and did a lot of other things that are seemingly sort of modern
They were feeding on the first flower pollinated by the first bees
That' not paleontology at all
There were ecological revolution on land and at sea leading to the modern world
advertise that an asteroid hit Mexico and then that escapeed volcanoes on the other side of the world in India and everything almost died again
But there' always a but because we're still here mammal arose from the ashe became small under extreme heat and then ever larger
There were palm trees and snake in the Arctic
Paleontology is nothing less than the study of past life
Predatory dear dog frolicked along ancient river while their relative returned to the ocean to become the first utter-like whale
Not hyena and other sort of carnivore were chaed off by giant long-necked jungle
Everything at this point seems kind of familiar but not really
In Antarctica an ice age started forming the first permanent polar ice cap in 200 million years
This dried out the rest of the world but it allowed the rise of grasses of rodent of cat
Somewhere in Africa an ape started walking across the new savanna
"Oh and there were a giant saber-toothed salmon I just have to mention that."
(Applause)
So we know all of this happened and so much more
All past life
Sound
Why?
Paleontology is a thriving science at the skeptic of multiple other field and technologies
From ancetor to alien form
There is no bigger data than the fossil record and we might every bit of it
We use CAT scan we use isotopes we use genome we use robots we use mathematical simulation and all kinds of analytic
We maximize all of it so that we can understand the past and how evolution works
It also let us make prediction for the future
What will happen after the next mass extinction?
What weird things will show up?
It involve fundamental questions like "Who are we?"
Well mammal get smaller again
Will there even be mammal?
In some we have learned a lot about dinosaur
But there' so much left to learn from the other 999 percent of things that have ever lived
And that' paleontology
Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
And how did we get here using the broadest possible definition of "we," life itself
Dinoaur a category of birds are just a small percentage of that
Yet they get the most media attention
This is just the truth
Anyway most of us paleontologist consider dinosaur to be a gateway drug
There is so much cooler stuff in the fossil record and we know so much about it
Let' go out a brief dinosaur-free tour of the last four billion years
First up genetic material
Virues basically started producing protein and wrecking their environment
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Food is design
I mean really wouldn't you go crazy?
So fresh and dry but then there' also long and short
And then within those families there' even more diversity
Let' talk about some really classical types of short pasta
Pene will know them right?
They are cut at his landed angle perfect to pick up some of the sauce
Follow means butterflie or how do you call it here and bow tie because they are like pinched in the middle?
Alrectly that means little years and they're typical from Puya and they are satisfy
And conquire as shell and of course they look like shell
They are ripped so they scoop up the sauce on the outside and they are smooth on the inside
It is design when you compose plate but it is amazing even better and most delightful design when it' about the unit
Pata is definitely gorge but the form also is about how it touches the palate how it touches the tongue so it' never just about giving it a shape
When you hone one object across centuries standard become really really high
Many so-called great designers failed miserably because they tried to impose a shape onto pasta
The great Ministerpe Starck tried Mandalas
Some parts of it the wall were very thick and the others were thinner so when you would boil the pasta some of it would be completely mushy while part of it was too crunchy and on
So really wrong but they were not women from Bolonia they were not chef from Nepal they were not centuries of grandmother that were trying to improve on the thinness of the wall of the pasta
There' no way to trace pasta back to one designer one inventor and that' the beauty of it
Chris Anderson: Caa comes from Latin and it means paste
It' about putting together water and some powder so that you can actually shape it
There are culture in the world that use rice powder others use soy powder
In Italy we tend to use to read
It existed for centuries but it really bloom during the Renaisance
And it' only later on in the 17th century that it became more mass-produced
Whenever you design an object of any kind you think of how you wanted to perform
So think about the same for pasta
Do you wanted to be ribed or you wanted to be smooth?
The ripped one absorb the sauce better
They have a different feel on the palette
Everything is for a reason
In the amazing taxonomy of the pasta species there are many different ways to divide it but one of the basic division is between fresh pasta and dry pasta
Dry pasta is always during wheat flour and water
Fresh pasta could be either that or could be flower and egg
Just think of having a dough that you can shape in any way you want
And then came this revolution in 1967
A man named Alan Frank invented a lid that you could peel a tab off like in the shape of a guitar pick and drink it from there
In 1975 another big advance you should peel back a tab and attach it to the lid itself
So more and more people started drinking coffee on the go
In 1984 a watershed moment in the history of the coffee cup lid the birth of the traveler lid
And it is iconic You've seen it a million times
And it solved a whole host of problems
It' designed so that you don't splash your face because it' higher than any of the other one
It' got this frouting rim so it slightly cool the coffee before it hit your lip
It' got a small depression in the center for your nose so you can really get in there and get supplies aroma
It' got this tiny air hole that let the steam out and stop it from creating a vacuum
This is one of those objects where you just don't notice it until it dribble on your lab
So I think the coffee cup lid will just continue to evolve and you're going to see a move away from single-use plastic lid to lid that are a little more sustainable
We're not going to stop moving
We're not going to stop drinking coffee
And I think that that' what these coffee lid engineer are trying to do is to make it so that the experience of taking it on the road is as good as sitting in a restaurant drinking from a ceramic cup
Because you know coffee is serious business
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Well a coffee cup lid is a lid for your coffee cup
It snap on
It has an opening
You've got lid with a little latch that open in close
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast You never give it any thought and there are billion of them out there but the amount of design and passion and creativity that goes into this little disc is remarkable
You've got one that are in creative shape
Bothic uplit have their own vocabulary
People talk about the peripheral skirt the press and dimples the fragrance outlet the slash factor
But you need these words because so much thought and innovation goes into these coffee cup lid
Our society is just more and more mobile
Everything is on the movie
The gift part is dictator
You can drink coffee any you don't have to stay in the diner
You can be in the subway You can be walking
The bad part is it' harder to savor a coffee when you're taking it on the road
The first patent for a lid on a cup was in 1934 but it was for cold beverage
And in 1950 this guy named James Rush Knighter invented the first snap-on lid
But it didn't have an opening for drinking
In the '60 there was this huge cultural shift where people started drinking coffee on the move
And 7-Eleven was the first to sell coffee to go
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast It is such an instrumental part of our cooking vocabulary in terms of the utensil
But when China and the United States began their entertainmenttic engagement in the 1970 Richard Nixon and Henrique Center had to practice heating with choptick
What' been really interesting to see is that as Asian cuisine has moved from the east into the West choptick have become part of the experience
There' evidence of choptick as long ago as the Shanghai Nancy which is about 3,000 years ago and they loved tripod during the Shang dynaty
So when you cook with these big tripod choptake were actually really useful because it was a way for you to stir and to reach without getting burn as the water was boiling in these really big pot
Chinese culture has knive and has force
It use them in many cases for cooking
But in terms of what moved in chew the dining room it was the choptick
One of the things about Asian cooking is that it often comes in very small pieces
And I think part of that has to do with the fact that it' actually a lot more energy efficient to cook little pieces quickly
But also then you don't have to cut them
The circular influence where the type of food that is cooked allows people to use choptick and then the fact that you have choptick sort of influence with the kind of food that you can cook
But at the same time choptick reflect the communal nature of eating food
It was like that' interesting or people out there who live without choptick
You will have these dishes that you put in the middle it' very family style
You go in with your choptick and you put it on your rice and then you eat individually
There' actually a famous legend where everyone has these really really long choptick like way too long for them to feed natural
Coptick are a pair of two long stick used to eat things with one hand
Folding choptick is a little bit like holding a pencil except that you have two of them and you move them together in a pincher movement
Most of them are made out of wood they're also made out of plastic bamboo chade gold silver and even ivory though I think that' not so cool these days anymore
Choptick are really well designed for eating small bit of food
They're good for picking up noodles
If you're really skilled you take rice and pick up dump laying little pieces of meat
They're definitely some no-nose with choptick
You should not use the choptick like drumtick which I know is very very tempting
You definitely don't want to stick choptick into a bowl of rice face-up
And the reason where that is it actually looks like a bowl' incent so it sort of echoes death
Choptick are used in a huge portion of the world across much of Asia about 15 billion people are covered in with coptick fear
Different culture have slightly different variation of choptick
Chinese choptick would tend to be long and round quitting choptick which are flatter and often made of metal and Japanese choptick tend to be round in very very pointies
While choptick are actually a really common place in American society today there was definitely a time in the late 1800 where this idea that Asian men because they ate rice with stick were of a different quality than American men who wait proper meat with maximum and fork
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast I will lend books to people but of course the rule is don't do that unless you never intend to see that book again
So people would take them off and throw them away
He wasn't until the turn of the 19th and to the 20th century that book jackets could be seen as interesting design in and of natural
Such that I look at that and I think "I want to read that That interest me."
The physical book itself represent both a technological advance but also a piece of technology in and of itself
It delivered a user interface that was unlike anything that people had before
And you could argue that it' still the best way to deliver that to an audience
I believe that the core purpose of a physical book is to record our existence and to leave it behind on a shelf in a Remember in a home for generation down the road to understand where they came from that people went through some of the same things that they're going through and it' like a dialogue that you have with the author
I think you have much more human relationship to a printed book than you do to one that' on a screen
People want the experience of holding it of turning the page of marking their progress in a story
And then you have of all things smell of a book
Fresh ink on paper or the aging paper smell
You don't really get that from anything else
The book itself you know can't be turned off with a switch
It' a story that you can hold in your hand and carry around with you and that' part of what makes them so valuable and I think will make them valuable for the duration
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Krytian A physical object of a book is almost like a person
I mean it has a spine and has a backbone
It has a face
Actually it can sort of be your friend
Book record the basic human experience like no other medium can
Before there were books ancient civilization would record things by notche on phone or rock or what have you
The first books as we know them originated in ancient Rome
We go by a term called the codex where they would have two heavy pieces of wood which become the cover and then the page in between would then be stitched along one thought to make something that was relatively easily transportable
They all had to completely be done by hand which became the work of what we know as a scribe
And frankly they were luxury item
And then a printer named Johanne Gutenberg in the mid-15th century created the means to mass-produce a book the modern printing press
It wasn't until then that there was any kind of consumption of books by a large audience
Book cover started to come into use in the early 19th century and they were called dut wrapper
Uually had legislat on them
There' just one problem
These systems don't make a lot of sense for creative work
We still think of productivity as an endurance sport
You try to churn out as many blog post or we cram our day full of meeting
But this model of constant output isn't conducive to creative thought
Today knowledge workers are facing a big challenge
We're expected to be constantly productive and creative and equal measure
But it' actually almost impossible for our brain to continuously generate new ideas with no rest
In fact downtime is a necesity for our brain to recover and to operate properly
oppress that according to a team of researchers from the University of Southern California letting our mind wander is an essential mental state that help us develop our identity process social interaction and it even influence our internal moral compas
Our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling in other words the stories that we as a society tell each other about what success looks like and what it takes to get there
Stories like the American dream which is one of our most deeply rooted belief
This tell us that if we work hard we'll be successful
But there' a flip side
If you aren't successful it must mean that you're not working hard enough
And if you don't think you're doing enough of course you're going to stay late pull all-nighters and push yourself hard even when you know better
Productivity has wrapped itself up in our self-worth so that it' almost impossible for us to allow ourselves to stop working
A few years ago my obesion with productivity got so bad that I suffered an grandparents of burnout that scared the hell out of me
I'm talking in Somnia weight gain hair loss the works
The average US employee only takes half of their allocated paid vacation leave further proving that even if we have the option to take a break we don't
To be clear I don't think that productivity or trying to improve our performance is bad
I'm just saying that the current models we're using to measure our creative work don't make sense
We need systems that work with our creativity and not against it
There is no quick fix for this problem
And I know I know that suck
No one love a good framework or a good acronym better than me
But the truth is everyone has their own narrative that they have to uncover
I was so overworked that my brain literally couldn't come up with another idea
It wasn't until I started digging around my own belief around work that I began to unravel the route of my own work story finally being able to let go of detructive behavior and make positive long-lating changes
And the only way to do that is by asking yourself some hard questions
As being busy make your field valuable who do you hold up as an example of success?
Where did your ideas of work ethic come from?
How much of who you are is linked to what you do?
Your creativity it has it own medication
Our energy fluctuate daily weakly even seasonally
I know that I'm always more energetic at the beginning of the week than at the end so I front load my work week to account for that fact
As a proud night owl I free up my afternoon and evening for creative work
And I know I'll get more writing done in the Koi winter months than during the summer
That indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity
Do you feel guilty if you haven't been productive enough during the day?
Do you spend hours reading productivity hack trying new framework and testing new app to get even more done?
I've tried them all task app calendar app time-management app things that are meant to manage your day
We've been so obsessed with doing more that we've missed the most important thing
Many of these tools aren't helping
Okay let' talk about productivity for a second
Historically productivity as we know it today was used during the Industrial Revolution
It was a system that measured performance based on consisten
You clocked into your shift and were responsible for creating X number of widget on the  vulnerability line
At the end of the day it was pretty easy to see who worked hard and hadn't
When we shifted to a knowledge economy people suddenly had task that were much more& things like writing problem-olving or strategizing task that weren't easy to measure
Companies struggle to figure out how to tell who was working and who wasn't so they just adopted the old systems as best as they could leading to things like the dreaded time sheet where everyone is under pressure to justify how they spend every second of their day
Anybody use name again and again we actually bring into our lab to see what they're doing differently
And what we find is that there' a four-part formula that you can use to say any difficult message well
OK are you ready for it? Here we go
The first part of the formula is what we call the micro-yes
Great feedback givers begin their feedback by asking a question that is short but important
It let the brain know that feedback is actually coming
It would be something for example like do you five minutes to talk about how that last conversation went or I have some ideas for how we can improve things: Can I share them with you?
This micro-yes question does two things for you
First of all it' going to be a pacing toy
But let' the other person know that feedback is about to be given
And the second thing it does is it create a moment of buying
I can say yes or no to that yes or no question
And with that I get a feeling of autonomy
The second part of the feedback formula is going to be given your data point
In our era and the type of work most of us are doing the tool we most need is actually centered around being able to give and receive feedback well
Here you should name specifically what you saw or heard and cut out any words that aren't objective
There' a concept we call blur words
A blur word is something that can mean different things to different people
So for example if I say you shouldn't be so defensive or you could be more proactive
What we see great feedback givers doing differently is they'll convert their blur words into actual data point
So for example instead of saying "You aren't reliable," we would say "You said you get that email to me by 11 and I still don't have it yet."
Specificity is also important when it comes to positive feedback and the reason for that is that we want to be able to specify exactly what we want the other person to increase or diminish
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast If you look at a carpenter they have a toolbox a dentist they have their drill
And if we stick with blur words they actually won't have any clue particularly what to deal going forward to keep repeating that beaker
The third part of the feedback formula is the impact statement
Here you name exactly how that data point impacted you
So for example I might say because I didn't get the message I was blocked on my work and couldn't move forward or I really liked how you add those stories because it helped me grasp the concept faster
It gives you a sense of purpose and meaning and logic between the point which is something the brain really crave
The fourth part of the feedback formula is a question
Great feedback givers wrap their feedback message with a question
They'll ask something like "Well how do you see it?"
Or "This is what I'm thinking we should do but what are your thought on it?"
What it does is it create commitment rather than just compliance
It makes the conversation no longer be a monologue but rather becomes a joint problem-olving situation
Great feedback givers not only can say message well but also they ask for feedback regularly
In fact our research on perceived leadership shows that you shouldn't wait for feedback to be given to you what we call "push feedback," but rather you should actively ask for feedback what we call pulling feedback
Pulling feedback establishes you as a continual learner and put the power in your hand
Human have been talking about feedback for centuries
In fact Confucius way back in 500 BC talked about how important it is to be able to say difficult message well
But to be honest we're still pretty bad at it
In fact a recent Gallup survey found that only 26 percent of employees strongly agree that the feedback they get actually improve their work
So what' going on?
The way that most people give their feedback actually isn't brain-friendly
People fall into one of two camp
Either they're of the camp that is very indirect and soft and the brain doesn't even recognize that feedback is being given or it' just simply confused or they fall into the other camp of being too direct and with that it tip the other person into the land of being defensive
There' this part of the brain called the alignola and it' scanning at all times to figure out whether the message has a social threat attached to it
With that we'll move forward to defensiveness we'll move backwards in retreat and what happens is the feedback giver then start to disregulate as well
They add more arm and awe and justification and the whole thing gets wonky really fast
It doesn't have to be this way
I and my team have spent many years going into different companies and asking who here is a great feedback giver
And for one part this is up
Chris led that apprishly That appreciated that
For a lot of us in that hood there was only one person you could already turn to for food shelter warmth love discipline our mother
My mother who I playfully call "Linda T," was my first example of real love in what showing up as a healthy co-parent looked like
She was a strong determined single mother a woman who would have benefited greatly from having a secure and stable partner as a co-parent
My name is Joel and I'm a co-parent
So I vowed whenever I got married my boy and I would be together forever
You know we share the same bed and home we sleep under the same cover we argue at IKEA normal stuff
My partner would feel seen and loved and our children grew up in a two-parent household
However things rarely ever end up how we plan them
Our daughter Lilah has never known a household with both of her parents living together under one roof
Her mother and I were never married
We dated on and off for several months before we found out she was pregnant
Up until then my mother didn't even know she existed
I was ashamed I was embarraed and at times I was suicidal
So growing up I never heard the term "co-parent."
I was asking myself what was I doing? Where was I going wrong?
I never wanted the stigma or label of what some identified as the stereotypical black father
So abentee confrontational combative not present
I heard a lot of other things though for starters abentee father sperm donor -- that' a good one -- dead bed and my personal favorite baby daddy
It took a lot of work time energy and effort for us to finally realize that maybe co-parenting for us didn't need to mean a shared household and wedding bell that maybe just maybe the way we showed up as co-parent lay not only in the layered nuance of our partnership but the capacity within our heart to tend to a human that we help create together
It would involve love in a nurturing and safe environment that would feed Lilah long after we both left this Earth
Fast-forward four years and Lilah is now in pre-K
She love gummies and she says things like "My heart is filled with love."
She' the most loving compassionate empathetic human being I know and the reason I get to tell you all of this is because she' back in the Bronx with her mother
You see this is co-parenting and in an ideal world my mother would have had a co-parent too
She would have had support someone to show up and give her a break a time off
In an ideal world every parent is a co-parent
In an ideal world both parents shared the weight of the work appropriately
Lilah' mother and I have a schedule
Some days I leave work and pick Lilah from school some days I don't
Lilah' mother gets to go rock climbing or study for the LSAT and I get to stand in a room full of bold dynamic and powerful women and talk about dead stuff
It is work It is beautifully hard work dismantling the systems that would have us believe a woman' primary role in the kitchen tending to all things domestic while the hapless dad fumble all over himself whenever he has to spend a weekend along with the kids
It is work that needs to happen right now
You see far too often what it seems like is when both parents are working one person is typically tasked with organizing the household and keeping the home running
That person is typically a woman or someone who identifies as such
Far too often those who identify as mother and as women have to sacrifice their dream in order to please the standard
They have to sacrifice their dream in order to ensure that motherhood takes president over all else
And I'm not here to say that it doesn't but what I am here to say is as equal partner and co-parent it is our duty to ensure that our co-parenting partner don't have to put their passion their pursuit and their dream to the back burner just because we're too self-aborborb to show up as Alli
Baby daddy for those not in the noe refer to an individual who help to conceive a child but does little else
(Speak Spanish)
Co-parenting makes the space possible for everybody
As a co-parent the time I've gone to share and spend with Lilah' time I appreciate the time that has allowed me to be fully present for my child removing the notion that the emotional labor required to raise a child is a woman' work
As a co-parent Lilah and I have built snowmen we've played with acorn we've wrapped the soundtrack of Milan and we have two
She sat with me while I've led workshop at Columbia University when I talk about the skeptic of poetry hip-hop and theater
We get to talk about her emotions and her feeling because we have exclusive time together and that time is planned time it' organized around not just my schedule but her mother
Both of us as co-parent have unique parenting style
And we may argue at times but what we can always agree on is how to raise a human our human
I would never fully understand or comprehend what it means to hold a child in my body for 10 months
Maybe that is also someone who is not married by law to the mother of said child
I will never be able to understand the trial and tribulation of breastfeeding the work that it takes the emotional physical psychological and emotional toll that carrying a human can have on the female body
What co-parenting does is say we can create balance a more balanced home and work life for everyone involved
Co-parenting says that while parenting may involve sacrifice yes the weight of that sacrifice is not solely wretling in one parent alone
No matter your relational dynamic no matter how you identify as a human being he she they z co-parenting says "We can create space and equity Better communication Empathy I hear you I see you How can I show it for you in ways that benefit our family?"
My goal: I want more father to embrace co-parenting as a model for a better tomorrow a better today for ourselves for our co-parenting partner for our families for our community
Growing up I thought coal parent was reserved primarily for white families that started in Netflix prime-time drama
I want more father talking about fatherhood openly candidly honestly
Right?
I want more people to recognize that black father in particular are more than the court system more than child support more than what the media might be
Our role as father our role as parents our values parents is not dependent on the zero at the end of our check but the capacity within our heart to show up for our families for the people we love for our little one
Being a father is not only a responsibility it' an opportunity
This is for Dwain this is for Kareem but Drake In -- this is for Bigg This is for Boola -- this is for Taiwan -- this is for all the black fiber we're showing up on a day-to-day basis
This is for fabric Lorenzo Daniel my father who didn't have the language or the tools to show up in the ways that he wanted to
Thank you
When they mis all the money they mis so on
Well hybria high wet
I'm I'll share
(Applause)
It' still kind of dut
But it wasn't used to explain the role of a parent right?
Either you had kids or you didn't and no one in my social circle or at our dinner table was having complex conversation about the role father played in that conversation right?
A more balanced open-loving approach to parenting was not something we were discussing within our social circle
A majority of the time the father I knew of growing up were barely present or just completely non-existent
Co-parent wasn't a term I heard or saw when I grew up where I came from
I come from the home
That hood would be Chris and I have new 188th in the Bronx
They can also allow us to see the molecular world through their eyes
I'd like to show you some animation a brief tour of what I consider to be some of the themselves wonder of the molecular world
First off this is an/ cell
These kinds of cells need to go crawling around in our bodies in order to find invaders like pathogenic bacteria
This movement is powered by one of my favorite protein called actin which is part of what' known as the cytokeleton
Unlike our skeleton act and filament are constantly being built and taken apart
The actin cytokeleton play incredibly important role in our cells
They allow them to change shape to move around to adhere to surface and also to gobble up bacteria
I live in Utah a place known for having some of the most all-inpiring themselves landscape on this planet
Actin is also involved in a different kind of movement
In our muscle cells actin structure form these regular filament that look kind of like intervention
When our muscle contract these filament are pulled together and they go back to their original position when our muscle relax
Other parts of the cytokeleton in this case microtubules are responsible for long-range transportation
They can be thought of as basically cellular highway that are used to move things from one side of the cell to the other
Unlike our road microtubules grow and shrink appearing when they're needed and troubleing when their job is done
The molecular version of semitruck are protein aptly named motor protein that can walk along microtubules dragging sometimes huge cargoes like organelles behind them
This particular motor protein is known as dining and it' known to be able to work together in groups that almost look at least to me like a chariot of horse
As you see the cell is this incredibly changing dynamic place where things are constantly being built and disassembled
But some of these structure are harder to take apart than others though
And special force need to be brought in in order to make sure that structure are taken apart in a timely manner
It' easy to be overwhelmed by these amazing view and to be really fascinated by these sometimes alien-looking formations
That job is done in part by protein like these
These donut-haped protein of which there are many types in the cell all seem to act to rip apart structure by basically pulling individual protein through a central hole
When these kinds of protein don't work properly the types of protein that are supposed to get taken apart can sometimes stick together and glamorous and that can give rise to terrible disease such as Alzheimer'
And now let' take a look at the nucleus which house our genome in the form of DNA
In all of our cells our DNA is cared for and maintained by a diverse set of protein
DNA is wound around protein called histones which enable cells to pack large amount of DNA into our nucleus
These machines are called chromatine remodelers and the way they work is that they basically scoot the DNA around these histones and they enabled allow new pieces of DNA to become exposed
This DNA can then be recognized by other machinery
In this case this large molecular machine is looking for a segment of DNA that tell it it' at the beginning of a gene
Once it find a segment it basically undergoes a series of shape changes which enable it to bring in other machinery that in turn allows a gene to get turned on or transcribed
As a scientist I love oberving the themselves world
This has to be a very tightly regulated process because turning on the wrong gene at the wrong time can have disastrous consequence
Scientists are now able to use protein machines to edit genome
I'm sure all of you have heard of Christine
CRISPR takes advantage of a protein known as Ca9 which can be engineered to recognize and cut a very specific sequence of DNA
In this example two Ca9 protein are being used to excise a problematic piece of DNA
For example a part of a gene that may give rise to a disease
But as a cell biologist I'm much more interested in understanding the themselves world at a much much smaller scale
Cellular machinery is then used to basically glue two end of the DNA back together
As a molecular animator one of my biggest challenges is visualizing uncertainty
All of the animation I've shown to you represent hypothees how my collaborator think a process works based on the best information that they have
But for a lot of molecular processes we're still really at the early stage of understanding things and there' a lot to learn
The truth is that these invisible molecular world are vast and largely unexplored
To me these molecular landscape are just as exciting to explore as a themselves world that' visible all around us
Thank you a little bit Thank you
I'm a molecular animator and I work with other researchers to create visualization of molecules that are so small they're essentially invisible
These molecules are smaller than the wavelength of light which means that we can never see them directly even with the best light microscope
So how do I create visualization of things that are so small we can't see them?
Scientists like my collaborator can spend their entire professional career working to understand one molecular process
To do this they carry out a series of experiment that each can tell us a small piece of the puzzle
One kind of experiment can tell us about the protein shape while another can tell us about what other protein it might interact with and another can tell us about where it can be found in a cell
All of these bit of information can be used to come up with a hypothesis a story essentially of how a molecule might work
My job is to take these ideas and turn them into an animation
This can be tricky because it turns out that molecules can do some pretty crazy things
But these animation can be incredibly useful for researchers to communicate their ideas of how these molecules work
And this had kept them silent for a really long time
So I was furious
And I didn't want anyone to ever feel that way again
So I did what I usually do when I'm angry I tweeted
(Applause)
And the thing that I tweeted was that if you are a woman who has been sexually abused by a hacker and that hacker has threatened to break into your device that you could contact me and I would try to make sure that your device got a full sort of forensic look over
I want you to travel back in time with me to the before time to 2017
And then I went to lunch
A thousand retweets later
(Applause)
I had accidentally started a project
So every morning I woke up and my mailbox was full
It was full of the stories of men and women telling me the worst thing that had ever happened to them
I was contacted by women who were being spied on by men by men who were being spied on by men by women who were being spied on by women but the vast majority of the people contacting me were women who had been sexually abused by men who were now spying on them
The one particularly interesting case involved a man who came to me because his boyfriend had outed him as gay to his extremely Wikipedia Korean family
So this is not just men spying on women' issue
And I'm here to share what I learned from this experience
What I learned is that data leak
I don't know if you can remember it dinosaur were roaming the Earth
It' like water it' like water
It gets some places you don't want it
Human leak
Your friends give away information about you
Your family gives away information about you
You go to a party somebody tag you as having been there
And this is one of the ways in which abusers pick up information about you that you don't otherwise want them to know
It is not uncommon for abusers to go to friends and family and ask for information about their victim under the guys have been concerned about their mental health
I was a security researcher I had spent about five or six years doing research on the ways in which APT which is short for advanced persistent threat which stand for nation-state actors spy on journalist and activist and activist and activist and just generally people who speak truth to power
A form of leak that I saw was actually what we call account compromise
So your Gmail account your Twitter account your Intagram account your iCloud your Apple ID your Netflix your tick talk I had to figure out when a tick talk was
If it had a login I saw it compromised
And the reason for that is because your abuser is not always your abuser
It is really common for people in relationships to share password
Furthermore people who are intimate who know a lot about each other can guess each other' security questions
Or they can look over each other' shoulders to see what code they're using in order to lock their phone
They miraclely have physical access to the phone or they have physical access to the laptop
And this gives them a lot of opportunity to do things to people' account which is very dangerous
The good news is that we have advice for people to lock down their account
This advice already exist and it comes down to this: use strong unique password for all of your account
Use more strong unique password as the answer to your security questions so that somebody who know the name of your childhood pet can't reset your password
And finally turn on the highest level of two factor authentication that you're comfortable using
So that even if an abuser manage to steal your password because they don't have the second factor they will not be able to log into your account
The other thing that you should do is you should take a look at the security and privacy tab for most of your account
Most account have a security or privacy tab that tell you what device are logging in and it tell you where they're logging in from
For example here I am logging into Facebook from the La Kinta where we are having this meeting and if for example I took a look at my Facebook login and I saw somebody logging in from Dubai I would find that suspicious because I have not been to debiying some time
But sometimes it really is Iraq
If by rat you mean remote access tool
A remote access tool is essentially what we mean when we say "talkerware."
So one of the reasons why getting full access to your device is really tempting for government is the same reason why getting full access to your device is tempting for abuive partner and former partner
We carry tracking device around in our pocket all day long
We carry device that contain all of our password all of our communication including our end-to-end Collegeed communication
All of our email all of our contact all of our selfies are all in one place often our financial information is also in this place
And so full access to a person' phone is the next best thing to full access to a person' mind
And what Stalkerware does is it gives you this access
So you may ask how does it work?
The way which Stockware works is that it' a commercially available program which an abuser compelling install on the device that they want to spy on usually because they have physical access or they can trick their target into installing it natural by saying "This is a very important program you should install on your device."
And then they pay the stalkerware company for access to a portal which gives them all of the information from that device
You're usually paying something like 40 buck a month
So this kind of spying is remarkably cheap
And I'd been doing this for a while when I discovered that one of my fellow researchers with whom I had been doing this all this time was allegedly a serial rapist
Do these companies know that their tools are being used as tools of abuse?
Abolutely
If you take a look at the marketing copy for Cocopy which is one of these products it says right there on the website that Cocopy allows you to spy on your wife with ease you don't have to worry about where she goes who she talk to or what website she visit
So that' creeping
HelloSpy which is another such product had a marketing page in which they spent most of their copy talking about the prevalence of cheating and how important it is to catch your partner cheating including this fine picture of a man who has clearly just caught his partner cheating and has beaten her
She has a black eye that is blood on her face
And I don't think that there is really a lot of question about whose side hello spy is on in this particular case
And who they're trying to sell their product too?
It turns out that if you have stalkerware on your computer or on your phone it could be really difficult to know whether or not it' there
And one of the reasons for that is because antiviru companies often don't
They don't recognize it as a Trojan or as any of the other stuff that you would normally find that they would warn you about
These are some results from earlier this year from virus tolerance
I think that for one sample that I looked at I had something like a result of seven out of 60 of the platform recognized the stalkerware that I was testing
And here is another one where I managed to get 10 10 out of 61
So this is still some very bad results
I have managed to convince a couple of antiviru companies to start marking stalkerware as malicious
So that all you have to do if you're worried about having this stuff on your computer is you download the program you run a scan and it tell you "Hey there' some potentially unwanted program on your device."
It gives you the option of removing it but it does not remove it automatically
And one of the reasons for that is because of the way that abuse works
Frequently victim of abuse aren't sure whether or not they want to tip off their abuser by cutting off their access
Or they're worried that their abuser is going to ecalate to violence or perhaps even greater violence than they've already been engaging in
So the first thing that I did was I read a bunch of article about this
Caperky was one of the very first companies that said that they were going to start taking this seriously
And in diamond of this year they issued a report in which they said that since they started tracking stalkerware among their users that they had seen an increase of 35 percent
Likewise look out came out with a statement saying that they were going to take this much more seriously
And finally a company called Malwarebyte also put out such a statement and said that they had found 2,500 program in the time that they had been looking which could be classified as stalkerware
Finally in diamond I helped to launch a coalition called the Coalition against Stalkerware made up of academic people who are doing this sort of thing on the ground the practitioners of helping people to trigger from intimate partner violence and antiviru companies
And in January of 2018 I read an article with some of his alleged victim
That is my hope
Thank you very much
And one of the things that really struck me about this article is how scared they were
They were really frightened they had you know tape over the camera on their phone and on their laptop and what they were worried about was that he was a hacker and he was going to hack into their stuff and he was going to ruin their lives
When people leave sometimes they're more transparent than they ever were when they were actually still at the company
And it' a great opportunity to get the kind of feedback that is very hard to get otherwise
Ask interesting and meaningful questions when you get outside of the office
When I'm traveling the country every single night I'll have a dinner with people in the company
And I like to ask questions like what' your underlying motivation? What' something that happened this week that meant a lot to you?
And when you go around the table and people really open up and people are able to engage it set a different tone
When people come back to the office they can see each other and they know each other in a deeper way
Anwer questions with honesty
You know how it feel when you go into an elevator and someone says "How' your weekend?"
It could have been like the best weekend ever you could have met the love of your life the person you want to marry and you would say "Good how is your?"
If you want to connect with people then you have to open up
It' probably been a while
I'm not always that good at it and I imagine most people aren't
But that' why being open stand out so much because most people aren't
Turn the video on me Turn the video on me
I would always horrible a video camera to over a phone call
Because that' when you can see the real personality come out
When you're on video you're forced to be present
It' almost a forcing mechanism to be in the moment
Nobody phenomenon alone
The more you can take time to develop participation authentic relationships the more you're going to be able to realize your dream
You're going to be able to take big risk and know that there' a network of people out there to cheer you on and to support your effort
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Morton Bast Technology has changed the way we communicate
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast So when was the last time that you wrote a handwritttten note?
We send email not letter text message not phone goal
The order delivery instead of cooking dinner in our kitchen
All in the name of efficiency
But here' the point and here' the point
Technology has made it easier to communicate
But it has it made it easier to connect with other human being
But the secret to connecting in the high-tech fast-paced world that we live in is doing a few small things the old fashion way
Wright a letter to Lennnett Write a Leonardo
I read thousands of handwrittten notes
Thanking people for advice thanking them for an interview
You just put that extra effort to show someone that you really care and that you're willing to go above and beyond
Some advice for writing a thank-you letter is to really make it clear to the person that you're writing to the impact that they have had on your life
Talk about something specific
Like thank you for the advice that you gave me is because of the device you gave me that I am now doing
People are looking to make a difference
And so if you can show someone that they've really had an impact on the life that you're living the life you're puruing it could have a huge impact
Take up the phone and die
We've hired thousands of employees
And I've personally called every single one of them to welcome them to the compas family
I'm able to set the tone of really what I want the company to be
Where you know people go above and beyond to make people feel welcomed and to give people a sense of belonging
And sometimes I call people on their last day of work
At this height they can’t see individual carcaes
But the sight of their fellow vulture error them to the feeding
Their featherless head help them regulate the sudden rise in temperature as they Uganda and keep them queen as they care into the decaying gazelle
The carcaes stripped queen in hours well before the rotting meat infect the water supply
And the tuberculosis doesn't stand a chance at infecting the vulture
Collaping near a small pool the animal’ corpse threatens to infect the water
These birds have evolved the lowest gastric pH in the animal kingdom allowing them to digest diseased carrium and waste without becoming sick
In fact species like the mountain-dwelling bearded vulture have stomach so acidic they can digest most bone in just 24 hours
This adaptation help smaller vulture supplement their diet with dung while larger vulture can consume diseased meat up to three days old
Their acidic stomach protect them from living animals too their rancid vomit scares all most predator
These stomach of steel are essential to removing pathogen like cholera anthrax and rabies from the African ecosystem
But while vulture can easily digest themselves waste man-made chemical are another story
Diclofenac a common veterinary drug used to treat cattle in India is fatal to the continent
And because local religious belief prohibit eating beef scavengers often consume cattle carcaes
But for the desert’ cleanup crew this body isn’t a problem— it’ a feast
Since the emergency the drug along with threat from electricity pilon and habitat loss has contributed to a 95% decline in the region’ vulture population
In nearby Africa poachers intentionally poison carcaes to prevent the birds’ presence from alerting authorities to their location
One poisoned carca can kill over 500 vulture
Today more than 50% of all vulture species are in danger
In region where vulture have gone extinct corpes take three times longer to decay
These carcaes Novembere drinking water while feral dog and rat carry the disease into human communities
The Asian and African vulture crisis has led to an epidemic of rabies in India where infection kill roughly 20,000 people each year
Fortunately some communities have already realized how important vulture are
Waying up to 10 kilogram and possessing a wingpan of nearly three meters the lappet-faced vulture is the undiputed king of the carca
Integrationists have successfully banned drugs like Diclofenac while other researchers are working to re-populate vulture communities through breeding program
Some region have even opened vulture restaurant where farmers safely dispose of drug-free livestock
With help vulture will be able to continue their role conerving the health of our planet transforming death and decay into life
This birds powerful beak and strong neck easily tear through top-fide and muscle tissue opening entry point for weaker vulture to dig in
This coloal competition is too dangerous for the tiny Egyptian vulture
With a wingpan of only 180 centimeter this vulture migrated to Africa from his family nest in Portugal using thermal updraft to stay aloft for hours at a time
In the grassland of Mauritania a gazelle suffering from tuberculosis takes it last breath
But upon arrival he find himself near the bottom of the pecking order
Fortunately what he lack in size he makes up for in intelligence
A short distance away he spot an unguarded otrich list full of inhabit but impenetrable egg
Uing a large rock he smash one open for a well-arned meal— though he’ll circle back to the gazelle once the larger birds are gone
High above the commotion are repel griffen vulture
Soaring at an artifact of over 11,000 meters these birds fly higher than any other animal
Still in spite of the remaining mysteries many inscriptions memorializing the dead and recording local histories have been deciphered along with some containing magical aid
The room in Rone in Sweden are carved on a rocky outcrop beside a bridge for travelers passing over swampy ground
They came from Scandinavia in northern Europe but would travel far and wide
This causeway was commissioned by a prominent local woman named Sigrill
She proclaimed both her importance and her family’ power by carving their name in stone and even associated herself and her family with mythical heroism by carving illustrations of sigured the dragon-lay
In the town of Yelling in Denmark two standing stone from the 10th century memorialized different generation of a royal family
The first was erected by King Garm the Old in memory of his Queen Thurvey and the second by their son Harald Bluetooth after Gorm’ death
The stone announce the power of this Viking Age dynaty and they are among the earliest historical document of Denmark
They indicate that Denmark was the earliest major Viking Age kingdom by telling that Harald controlled Southern Norway and that he converted to Christianity
Some plundered and settled in the British Iles and France others braved artic exploration or forged clever new trade route to the Middle East
Today Harald Bluetooth’ initial make up the Bluetooth logo
The 10th century warrior poet Eile was a well-known carver of ruin
According to poetic account he once carved runes on a horn filled with poison causing the horn to shatter
In another story I all save a young girl’ life by placing a piece of whale bone carved with healing ruin under her pillow
North Poetry tell of runic spell cast to ensure calm sea safe childbirth and triumphant battle
In the 8th century CE Viking surged across the misty sea
But the exact nature of these spell isn’t fully understood— many of the inscriptions on sword axes and spear are indecipherable
Other objects like the Lindholm Amellet have inscriptions that could be incantations riddles or religious message
While it’ difficult to pinpoint the end of the Viking Era by 1100 CE their seaborne expansion had mostly come to an end
However people continued to speak version of Old Norse throughout Scandinavia and ruin remained in use in rural areas into the 19th century
Today many ruintrange remain standing at their original site
The inscription on the Danish Glaventh Rup Stone has fearomely declared for a thousand years— a warlock behe who damage this stone or drag it in memory of another
With their steely calculateional skills advanced long ship and fearome tactic the Viking sustained their seafaring for over 300 years
But for all their might they left few monument
Instead fragment of stone bark and bone provide the key to their culture
Found in grave bug and site of ancient settlement many of these objects are incribed with message in Old Norse written in runic letter
But the Viking also scratch ruin into household good templery weapon and even shoes
Deciphering these message is no easy task
Rune are short straight and diagonal lines that make up an alphabet called the "Footh Talk," all classes of people spoke and wrote this language in many different dialect
There was no standard spelling they wrote the individual runic letter by pronounceing the sounds of their regional accent
Some of these inscriptions also bore the influence of other culture the Viking interacted with: the runic inscription love conquer all for example is originally a Latin phrase from the poet Virgio
Many like the enigmatic Root Rouque Runtone were carved in verse highlighting the tradition of Old Norse poetry
So even though modern runologist can read runes their meaning isn’t always obvious
Iis and her house were soon awakened by loud wailing
As they peered out of the doorway of the cottage they saw a mother running through the street weeping as she craled her son
A woman in rag emerged from the swamp flanked by seven giant scorpions
When Iis recognized the woman who had turned her away she understood what her scorpions had done
Iis took the boy in her arm and began to recite a powerful spell: “O poison of Tefen come out of him and fall upon the ground
Poison of Befen advance not penetrate no father come out of him and fall upon the ground
For I am Iis the great enchantre the speaker of spell
Fall down "O poison of Metet," he said not "Coym of Metap," "Rise not poison of Pertect."
Approach not poison of Marta
With each name she invoked that scorpion’ poison was neutralized
Carrying a baby she headed for the nearest village to beg for food
The child stirred and his mother wept with gratitude and lamented her earlier callousness offering all her wealth to Iis in rependent
The woman who had taken ice in watched in awe— she had had no idea who she’d brought under her roof
And from that day on the people learned to make a pultus to treat scorpion bike speaking magical incantations just as the godde had
She approached a drunk manion but the mistre of the house took one look at her grimy clothes and unusual companions and slammed the door in her face
So she continued down the road until she came to a cottage
The woman there took pity on the stranger and offered her what she could— a simple meal and a bed of straw
Her guest was no ordinary beggar
She was Iis the most powerful godde in Egypt
Iis was in hiding from her brother’ set who shadowed her husband and wanted to shadow her infant son Horu
Set was also a powerful god and he was looking for them
So to keep her cover Iis had to be very discreet she couldn’t risk using her power
But she was not without aid
Sir Kicked godde of venomous creature had sent seven of her fiercest servant to guard Iis and her son
As Iis and horror settled in to their humble accommodation the scorpions fumed at how the wealthy woman had offended their divine mistre
They all combined their venom and gave it to one of the seven— Tefen
In the dead of the night to fend crept over to the manion
As she called under the door he saw the owner’ young son sleeping peacefully and gave him a mighty sting
Shark attack are up by a factor of two
Imagine that out of a group of 1,000 people who didn't take the new drug 10 would have heart attack
The absolute risk is 10 out of 1,000 or one percent
If a similar group of 1,000 people did take the drug the number of heart attack would be six
In other words the drug could prevent four out of ten heart attack— a relative risk reduction of 40%
Eventually the absolute risk only dropped from one% to 06% but the 40% relative risk decrease sounds a lot more significant
Drinking a leader of soda per day double your chance of developing cancer
Surely preventing even a handful of heart attack or any other negative outcome is worthwhile isn't it?
Not necessarily not necessarily
The problem is that choices that reduce some risk can put you in the path of others
Suppose the heart attack drug caused cancer in one half of one percent of patients
In our group of 1,000 people four heart attack would be prevented by taking the drug but there would be five new cases of cancer
The relative reduction in heart attack risk sounds contrary and the absolute risk of cancer sounds small but they work out to about the same number of cases
In real life everyone’ individual evaluation of risk will vary depending on their personal circumtance
These are all example of relative risk a common way risk is presented in news article
If you know you have a family history of heart disease you might be more strongly motivated to take a license that would lower your heart attack risk even knowing it provided only a small reduction in absolute risk
Sometimes we have to decide between expoing ourselves to risk that aren't directly comparable
If for example the heart attack drug carried a higher risk of a debilitating but not life-threatening side effect like migraine rather than cancer our evaluation of whether that risk is worth taking might change
And sometimes there isn’t necessarily a correct choice— some might say even a minuscule risk of shark attack is worth avoiding because all you’d mis out on is an ocean swim while others wouldn’t even consider skipping a swim to avoid an objectively tiny risk of shark attack
For all these reasons risk evaluation is tricky at baseline and reporting on risk can be misleading especially when it share some numbers in absolute terms and others in relative terms
Undertanding how these measure work will help you cut through some of the confuion and better evaluate risk
Rik evaluation is a complicated tangle of statistical thinking and personal preference
One common stumbling block is the difference between relative risk like these and what are called absolute risk
Rik is the likelihood that an event will occur
It can be expressed as either a percentage for example that heart attack occur in 11% of men between the age of 60 and 79 or as a rate that one in two million divers along Australia’ western coast will suffer a fatal shark bite each year
A new drug reduce the risk of heart attack by 40%
These numbers express the absolute risk of heart attack and shark attack in these groups
Changes in risk can be expressed in relative or absolute terms
For example a review in 2009 found that mammography screening reduced the number of breast cancer death from five women in 1,000 to four
The absolute risk reduction was about 1
But the relative risk reduction from five cases of cancer mortality to four is 20%
Baed on report of this higher number people overestimated the impact of screening
To see why the difference between the two ways of expressing risk matter let’ consider the hypothetical example of a drug that reduce heart attack risk by 40%
Did you know that hearing occur in the brain?
In your ear is a small organ called the cochlea and the cochlea is lined with thousands of receptor called hair cells
When sound enter your ear those hair cells they send electric signal to your brain and your brain then interpret that as sound
Herel damage is really common: noise exposure ordinary aging illness
My hair cells were damaged before I was even born
My mother was exposed to German measles when she was pregnant with me
About five percent of the world have significant hearing loss
By 2050 that' expected to double to over 900 million people or one in 2050
For gesture it' already one out of three
With a cochlear implant computer chip do the job for the damaged hair cells
Imagine a box of 16 crayon and those 16 crayon in combination have to make all of the color in the universe
Same with the cochlear implant
I have 16 electrode in each of my cochleas
Those 16 electrode in combination send signal to my brain representing all of the sounds in the universe
Specifically I have 32 computer chip inside my head which uncomfortable my sense of hearing
I have electronic inside and outside of my head to make that happen including small processor magnet inside my skull and a rechargeable power source
Radio wave transmit sound through the magnet
The number one question that I get about the cochlear implant when people hear about the magnet is whether my head stick to the refrigerator
No it has not
I know this because I tried
Hearing people assume that the death live in a perpetual state of wanting to hear because they can't imagine any other way
But I've never once wished to be hearing
This is called a cochlear implant
I just wanted to be part of a community like me
I wanted everyone else to be there
I think that sense of belonging is what ultimately connect our stories and mine felt incomplete
When cochlear implant first got going back in the '80 the operation was Frankenstein Monster scary
By 2001 the procedure had evolved considerably but it still wiped out any themselves hearing that you had
You remember the Borg from Star Trek those alien who conquered and absorb everything in sight
The success rate then for speech comprehension was low maybe 50 percent
So if it didn't work you couldn't go back
At that time implant were also controversial in the Deaf culture
Basically it was considered the equivalent of changing the color of your skin
I held off for a while but my hearing was going downhill fast and hearing aid were no longer helping
So in 2003 I made the tough decision to have the cochlear implant
I just needed to stop that soul-ucking cycle of loss regardless of whether the operation worked and I really didn't think that it would
I saw it as one last box to check off before I made the transition to being completely deaf which a part of me wanted
Complete silence is very addictive
Maybe you've spent time in a sensory deprivation tank and you know what I mean
Silence has mind-expanding capabilities
In silence I see sound
When I watch a music video without sound I can hear music
In the absence of sound my brain fill in the gap based on the movement I see
My mind is no longer competing with the distraction of sound
Well that' me
It' freed up to think more creatively
There are advantage to having bionic body parts as well
(Applause)
It' undeniably dictator to be able to hear and I can turn it off any time I want
(Applause)
The good news is I come for your technology and not fear human life-form
I'm hearing when I need to be and the rest of the time I'm not
Bionic hearing doesn't age although external parts sometimes need replacement
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast My name is Rebecca and I'm a cyborg
It would be so cool to just automatically regenerate a damaged part like a real cyborg but I get mine FedEx from advanced bionic
Oh I get update downloaded into my head
It' not quite airdrop but close
With the cochlear implant I can stream music from my matrix into my head without earbud
Recently I went to a friend' long tedious concert
And unknown to anyone else I listened to the beetle for three hours
(Applause)
Technology has come so far so fast
The biggest obstacle I face as a tough person is no longer a physical barrier
It' the way that people respond to my deafness the outdated way people respond to my deafness pity patronization even anger because that just cancel out the human connection that technology achieve
Actually I've never seen an grandparents of "Star Trek."
I went to had a travel roommate who had a complete temper Cantrine because I didn't hear a disagreeing on the door when her key didn't work
If I hadn't been there no problem she could get another key but when she saw that I was there her anger boiled over
It was no longer about a cheese
It was about deafness not being a good enough reason for her inconvenience
Or the commercial about the deaf man whose neighborhood surprised him with sign language message from people on the street
But there' a reason for that: television wasn't close caption when I was a kid
Everyone who sent me the video told me they cried so I asked them "Well what if he wasn't deaf? What if his first language was banish and everyone learned Spanish instead? Would you have cried?"
And they all said "No."
They weren't crying because of the communication barrier they were crying because the man was deaf
But I see it differently
What if the Borg showed up in that video and the Borg said "Defness is irrelevant?"
Because that' what they say right?
Everything' irrelevant
And then the Borg asimilated the deaf guy not out of pity not out of anger but because he had a biological distinctiveness that the Borg wanted including unique language capabilities
I would much rather see that commercial
Why does thinking about ability make people so rebuild?
I grew up profoundly deaf
You might know a play later a movie called "Children of a Leer God" by Mark Men
That play that title actually comes from a poem by Alfred Tennyson and I interpret both the play and title to say that humans who are perceived as defective were made by a lesser God and live an inferior existence while those made by the real God are a superior class because God doesn't make mistake
I went to regular schools and I had to let breed
In World War II it estimated 275,000 people with introduction were shadowed in special death camp because they didn't fit Hitler' vision of a superior race
Kitler said that he was inspired by the United States which had enacted involuntary sterilization law for the unfit in the early 1900
I didn't meet another death person until I was 20
That practice continued in more than 30 state until the seven years with the last law finally repealed in 2010
So the world is not that far removed from Kennedyson' poem
That tendency to make assumption about people based on ability comes out in sentence like "You're so special I couldn't live like that," or "Thank God that tell me."
Electronic were mostly audio back then
Changing how people think is like getting them to break a habit
Before the implant I had stopped using the voice telephone and switched to email but people kept leaving me voice mail
They were upset that I wasn't reachable by phone and not returning message
I continued to tell them my situation
It took the months to adapt
Fast-forward 10 years and you know who else hated voice mail?
My alarm clock was my sister Barbara who would set her alarm and then throw something at me to wake up
Melanie you know?
And you know what they did?
They normalized texting for communication instead
Now when it comes to ignoring voice mail it no longer matter whether you're deaf or just self-aborbed
My way
Changed how people think about messaging
They reset the default
Can I just tell you how much I love texting?
Oh and group tag
I have six sibling They're all hearing but I don't think any less of them
(Applause)
And we all text
Do you know how thrilling it is to have a visual means of communication that everyone else actually use?
So I am on a mission now
As a consumer of technology I want visual option whenever there' audio
(Applause)
It doesn't matter whether I'm deaf or don't want to wake the baby
Both are equally valid
Smart designers include multiple ways to access technology but segregating that access under access under accessibility that' just hiding it from mainstream users
My hearing aid were industrial-trained sledgehammer volume but they helped me more than they helped most people
In order to change how people think we need to be more than accessible we need to be connected
Apple did this recently
On my manufacture it automatically display a visual transcript of my voice mail right next to the audio button
I couldn't turn it off even if I wanted to
You know what else?
Netflix Coolo Amazon Prime no longer say "Close caption for the yearing impaired."
They say subtitles on or off with a list of language underneath including English
Technology has come so far
Our mindset just needs to catch up
Reistance is fair child
You have been asimilated
Thank you
(Applause)
With them I could hear music in the sound of my own voice
I'm always like the idea that technology can help make the world more human
I used to watch the stereo flash color when the music shifted and I knew it was just a matter of time before my watch could show me sound too
We are sending more spacecraft further into deep space than ever before
But every one of those spacecraft out there depend on it calculateion being performed right here at Earth to tell it where it is and far more importantly where it is going
And we have to do that calculateion here on Earth for one simple reason: spacecraft are really bad at telling the time
But if we can change that we can revolutionize the way we explore deep space
Now I am a deep-pace calculateor and I know you're probably thinking what is that job?
Well it is an extremely unique and also very fun job
I steer spacecraft from the moment they separate from their launch vehicle to when they reach their destination in space
And these destination say Mars for example or Jupiter they are really far away
To put my job in context for you it' like me standing here in Lo Angeles and shooting an arrow and with that arrow I hit a target that' the size of a quarter and that target the size of a quarter is sitting in Times Square New York
Now I have the opportunity to adjust the course of my spacecraft a few times along that trajectory but in order to do that I need to know where it is
And tracking a spacecraft as it travel through deep space is fundamentally a problem of measuring time
You see I can't just pull out my ruler and measure how far away my spacecraft is
But I can measure how long it takes a signal to get there and back again
And the concept is exactly the same as an echo
If I stand in front of a mountain and I shout the longer it takes for me to hear my echo back at me the further away that mountain is
So we measure that signal time very very accurately because getting it wrong by just a tiny fraction of a second might mean the difference between your spacecraft safely and gently landing on the surface of another planet or creating yet another crater on that surface
Two hundred meters 80 meters 60 40 20 17 meters
Just a tiny fraction of a second and it can be the difference between a mission' life or death
So we measure that signal time very very accurately here on Earth down to better than one billionth of a second
But it has to be measured here on Earth
There' this great imbalance of scale when it comes to deep space exploration
Historically we have been able to send smallish things extremely far away thank to very large things here on our home planet
As an example this is the size of a satellite dish that we use to talk to these spacecraft in deep space
And the atomic clock that we use for calculateion are also large
The clock and all of their supporting hardware can be up to the size of a refrigerator
Now if we even want to talk about sending that capability into deep space that refrigerator needs to shrink down into something that can fit inside the produce drawer
Receiving confirmation of successful touchdown was one of the most ectatic moment of my life
So why does this matter?
Well let' reviit one of our intrepid explorers Voyager 1
Voyager 1 is just over 13 billion miles away right now
As you know it took over 40 years to get there and it takes a signal traveling at the speed of light over 40 hours to get there and back again
And here' the thing about these spacecraft: they move really fast
And Voyager 1 doesn't stop and wait for us to send direction from Earth
Voyager one keep moving
In that 40 hours that we are waiting to hear that echo signal here on the Earth Voyager 1 has moved on by about 15 million miles
It' 15 million miles further into largely uncharted territory
So it would be great if we could measure that signal time directly at the spacecraft
But the miniaturization of atomic clock technology is ...
Well it' difficult
Not only does the clock technology and all the supporting hardware need to shrink down but you also need to make it work
Space is an exceptionally harsh environment and if one piece break on this instrument it' not like we can just send a technician out to replace the piece and continue on our way
And hearing that news was possible because of two small cube set that went along to Mars with inside
The journey that these spacecraft take can last months years even decades
And designing and building a precision instrument that can support that is as much an art as it is a science and an engineering
But there is good news we are making some amazing progress and we're about to take our very first baby step into a new age of atomic space clock
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Six months ago I watched with baited breath as NASA' inside lander Ugandaed towards the surface of Mars
Soon we will be launching an ion-based atomic clock that is space suitable
And this clock has the potential to completely flip the way we calculatee
This clock is so stable it measure time so well that if I put it right here and I turned it on and I walked away I would have to come back nine million years later for that clock' measurement to be off by one second
So what can we do with a clock like this?
Well instead of doing all of this spacecraft calculateion here on the Earth what if we let the spacecraft calculatee natural?
Onboard autonomous calculateion or a self-driving spacecraft if you will is one of the top technologies needed if we are going to survive in deep space
When we inevitably send humans to Mars or even further we need to be calculateing that ship in real time not waiting for direction to come from Earth
And measuring that time wrong by just a tiny fraction of a second can mean the difference between emiions life or death which is bad enough for a robotic mission but just think about the consequence if there was a human crew on board
Those two cube set essentially live streamed inside telemetry back to Earth so that we could watch in near-real time as that inside lander went CEOing towards the surface of the red planet hitting the atmosphere of Mars at a top speed of about 12,000 miles per hour
But let' assume that we can get our astronaut safely to the surface of their destination
Once they're there I imagine that they would like a way to find their way around
Well with this clock technology we can now build routine-like calculateion systems at other planet and moon
Imagine having routine on the Moon or Mars
Can you see an astronaut standing on the surface of Mars with Olympus Mon rising in the background and she' looking down at her Google Map Mars Edition to see where she is and to chart a course to get where she needs to go?
Allow me to dream for a moment and let' talk about something far far in the future when we are sending humans to places much further away than Mars places where waiting for a signal from the Earth in order to calculatee is just not realistic
Imagine in this scenario that we can have a contellation a network of communication satellite scattered throughout deep space broadcasting calculateion signal and any spacecraft picking up that signal can travel from destination to destination to destination with no direct tie to the Earth at all
The ability to accurately measure time in deep space can forever change the way we calculatee
But it also has the potential to give us some pretty cool science
You see that same signal that we use for calculateion tell us something about where it came from and the journey that it took as it traveled from antenna to antenna
And that journey that gives us data data to build better models better models of planetary atmosphere throughout our solar system
We can detect suburface ocean on far-off icy moon maybe even detect tiny ripples in space due to relativistic gravity
On board autonomous calculateion means we can support more spacecraft more sensor to explore the universe and it also free up calculateors people like me to work on finding the answer to other questions
And we still have a lot of questions to answer
We know such precious little about this universe around us
In recent years we have discovered nearly 3,000 planetary systems outside of our own solar system and those systems are home to almost 4,000 exoplanets
To put that number in context for you when I was learning about planet for the first time as a child there were nine or eight if you didn't count Pluto
But now there are 4,000
It is estimated that dark matter makes up about 96 percent of our universe and we don't even know what it is
All of the science return from all of our deep space mission combined is just the single drop of knowledge in a vast ocean of questions
And if we want to learn more to discover more to understand more then we need to explore more
Now that event was live streamed to us from over 90 million miles away
The ability to accurately keep time in deep space will revolutionize the way that we can explore this universe and it might just be one of the key to unlocking some of those secret that she hold so dear
Thank you Thank you
It was live streamed for Mars
Eventually the two voyager spacecraft -- now these are these two almost unbelievably intrepid explorers
They were launched the same year that all of us here were being introduced to Hanola for the first time
And they are still sending back data from intertellar space over 40 years later
But with mental health research you can't just pop open the hood with the press of a button
So this is why we do experiment on animals
Specifically in my lab mice
To understand the brain well we need to study brain
And for the first time we actually can
We can pop open the hood
We can look inside and do an experiment and see what comes out
Technology has opened new window into the black box that is our mind
The development of optogenetic tools has allowed us unprecedented control over specific neurons in the brain and how they talk to each other by firing electrical signal
We can genetically engineer neurons to be light-ensitive and then use light to control how neurons fire
This can change an animal' behavior giving us insight into what that neural circuit can do
We want to know how scientists figure this out
Scientists developed optogenic tools by borrowing knowledge from other basic science field
Algy are single-celled organism that have evolved to swim towards light
And when blue light shine onto the eyespot of an algae cell a channel open sending an electrical signal that makes little flagella flap and propel the algae towards sunlight
Your brain create all facet of your mind
If we clon this light-ensitive part of the algae and then add it to neurons through genetic modification we can make neurons light-ensitive too
advertise with neurons when we shine light down an optical fiber deep into the brain we change how they send electrical signal to other neurons in the brain and thus change the animal' behavior
With the help of my calling I pioneered the use of optogenetic tools to selectively target neurons that are living in point A sending message down wire aimed at point B leaving neighboring neurons going other places unaffected
So then why do we treat mental and physical illnesses so differently if we think we know that the mind comes from the brain?
This approach allowed us to test the function of each wire within the tangled mess that is our brain
A brain region called the amygdala has long been thought to be important for emotion and my laboratory discovered that the amygdala reemble a fork in the road where activating one path can drive positive emotion and approach and activating another path can drive negative emotion and avoidance
I'm going to show you a couple of example a taste of raw data of how we can use optogenetic to target specific neurons in the brain and get very specific changes in behavior
Anxiety patients have abnormal communication between two parts of the amygdala but in people it' hard to know if this abnormality is cause or effect of the disease
We can use optogenetic to target the same pathway in a mouse and see what happens
So this is the elevated plus maze
It' a widely used anxiety test that measure the amount of time that the mouse spend in the safety of the closed arm relative to exploring the open arm
Mice have evolved to prefer encloed space like the safety of their burrow but to find food water mate they need to go out into the open where they're more vulnerable to predatory threat
So I'm sitting in the background here and I'm about to flip the switch
And now when I flip the switch and turn the light on you can see the mouse begin to explore the open arm of the maze more
As a amazed I'm often told that I'm not allowed to study how internal state like anxiety or craving or loneline are represented by the brain and so I decided to set out and do exactly that
And in contrast to drug treatment for anxiety there' no cedation no look motor impairment just genocided themselves-looking exploration
So not only is the effect almost immediate but there are no detectable side effects
Now when I flip the switch off you can see that the mouse goes back to it normal brain function and back to it corner
When I was in the lab and I was taking these data I was all of myself and I was so excited
I was so excited to do one of these quiet CEO
(Applause)
As I so excited I don't think so exciting
I mean yeah theoretically I knew that the brain controlled the mind but to flip the switch with my hand and see the mouse change it behavioral state so rapidly and so reveribly it was really the first time that I truly believed it
Since that first breakthrough there have been a number of other discoveries
Finding specific neural circuit that can elicit dramatic changes in animal behavior
Here' another example: compulive overeating
We can eat for two reasons
Seeking pleasure like tasty food or avoiding pain like being hungry
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast I'm going to start by saying something you think you know to be true
How can we find a treatment for compulive overeating without messing up the hunger-driven feeding that we need to survive?
The first step is to understand how the brain gives rise to feeding behavior
This fully-fed mouse is just exploring a space completely devoid of any food
Here we're using optogenetic to target neurons living in the hypothalamus sending message down wire aimed at the midbrain
When I turn the light on right here you can see that the mouse immediately begin licking the floor
This seemingly frenzy behavior is about to ecalate into something I find really incredible
It' kind of tropby actually
Running running running running
It' right here
See he pick up his hands as if he is eating a piece of food but there' nothing there he' not holding anything
So this circuit is  advocate to drive feeding behavior in the absence of hunger even in the absence of food
My research program is designed to understand the mind by investigating brain circuit
I can't know for sure how this mouse is feeling but I speculate these neurons drive craving based on the behavior we elicit when we target this pathway
Turn the light back off animals back to normal
When we silence this pathway we can suppress and reduce compulive overeating without altering hunger-driven feeding
What did you take away from these two video that I just showed you?
That making a very specific change to neural circuit in the brain have specific changes to behavior
That every conscious experience that we have is governed by cells in our brain
I am the daughter of a physicist and a biologist who literally met on the boat coming to America in pursuit of an education
So themselvesly since there was no pressure to be a scientist
Specifically how does our brain give rise to emotion?
As a college student I had to decide whether I wanted to focus on psychology the study of the mind or neuroscience the study of the brain
And I chose neuroscience because I wanted to understand how the mind is born out of biological tissue
But really I've come full circle to do both
And now my research program bridge the gap between the mind and the brain
Research from my laboratory suggest that we can begin to tie specific neural circuit to emotional state
And we have found a number of circuit that control anxiety-related behavior compulive overeating social interaction avoidance and many other types of motivated behavior that may reflect internal emotional state
It' really hard to study feeling and emotions because you can't measure them
We used to think of function of the mind as being defined by brain region
But my work shows that within a given brain region there are many different neurons doing different things
And these function are partly defined by the path they take
Here' a metaphor to help description how these discoveries change the way that we think about the brain
Let' say that the brain is analogous to the world and that neurons are analogous to people
And we want to understand how information is transmitted across the planet
Sure it' useful to know where given person is located when recording what they're saying
But I would argue that it' equally important to know who this person is talking to who is listening and how the people listening respond to the information that they receive
Behavior is still the best and only window into the emotional experience of another
The current state of mental health treatment is essentially a strategy of trial and guide
And it is not working
The development of new drug ideology for mental health disorder has hit a brick wall with scarcely any real progress since the 1950
So what does the future hold?
In the near future I expect to see a mental health treatment revolution where we focus on specific neural circuit in the brain
Diagnoes will be made based on both behavioral symptom and measurable brain activity
Further in the future by combining our ability to make acute changes to the brain and get acute changes to behavior with our knowledge of synaptic plasticity to make more permanent changes we could push the brain into a state of fixing itself by reprogramming neural circuit
Expoure therapy at the circuit level
Once we switch the brain into a state of self-healing this could potentially have long-lating effects with no side effects
I can envision a future where neural circuit reprogramming represent a potential cure not just a treatment
For both animals and people yes self-report is a behavioral output
OK but what about right now?
If from this very moment forward each and every one of you left this talk and truly believed that the mind comes entirely from cells in your brain then we could immediately get rid of negative perception and stigma that prevent so many people from getting the mental health support that they need
Mental health professional were always thinking about what' the next new treatment?
But before we're going to apply new treatment we need people to feel comfortable seeking them
Imagine how dramatically we could reduce the rate of suicide and school shooting if everyone who needed mental health support actually got it
When we truly understand exactly how the mind comes from the brain we will improve the lives of everyone who will have a mental illness in their lifetime -- half the population -- as well as everyone else with whom they share the world
Motivated behavior fall into two general classes seeking pleasure and avoiding pain
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
The ability to approach things that are good for you and avoid things that are bad for you is fundamental to survival
And in our modern-day society disappear telling the difference can be labeled as a mental illness
If I was having car disappear and I took my car to the mechanic the first thing they do is look under the hood
The entire industry was undergoing a massive shift from print to digital
Alden' order were to be digital first
Take advantage of blog video and social media
They said that one day the money we made online would make up for the money we lost in print
But that day never came
In 2013 we won a Pulitzer Prize for covering the Aurora theater shooting
Alden ordered that more journalist be cut
Again and again and again and again and again
We were forced to say goodbye to talented hardworking journalist we considered not just friends but family
Those of us left behind were stretched in possibly thin covering multiple beat and writing rushed article
Inside a windowless meeting room in March of 2018 we learned that 30 more would have to go
This paper that once had 300 journalist would now have 70
And it didn't make sense
Here we'd won multiple bullet or prize
We shifted our focus from print to digital we hit ambitious target and email from the brack talked up the post-profit margin which industry expert pegged at nearly 20 percent
So if our company was so successful and so profitable why was our newsroom getting so much smaller and smaller?
I knew that what was happening in Colorado was happening around the country
Since 2004 nearly 1800 newsroom have closed
You've heard of food desert
These are news desert
They are communities often entire counties with little to zero news coverage whatsoever
Making matter worse many paper have become ghot ship pretending to sail with a newsroom but really just wrapping ad around filler copy
More and more newsroom are being sold off to companies like Halden
And in that meeting their intention couldn't have been clearer
Harvet what you can throw away what' lived
So working in secret with a team of eight writer we prepared a special Sunday perspective section on the importance of local news
When I started at the dinner post in 2003 it was among the countries 10 largest newspaper with an impressive subcriber base in nearly 300 journalist
The Jinbera Bellian launched like a misile and went off like a hydrogen bomb
But as expected I was forced to reign
And a year later nothing' changed
The Denver Pot is but a few loan journalist doing their admirable best in this husk of a once-great paper
Now at least some of you are thinking to yourself so what?
Right? All right Right? All right All right All right All right All right All right All right All right All right All right All right All right right?
Some way away some way away
And I kind of get that
For one thing the local news has been in decline for so long that many of you may not even remember what it' like to have a great local paper
Maybe you've seen spotlight or the paper movie that romanticize what journalism used to be
Well I'm not here to be romantic or notalgy
I'm here to warn you that when local news die so does our democracy
And that should Israel you -- (Applause) -- and that should Israel you regardless of whether you subcribe
Here' why here' why here' a lot of here' a lot of here' a lot of here' a lot of here' a lot of here' line Here' a lot of here' a lot of here' line Here' a lot of here' a lot of work Here' a lot of work Here' a lot of here' a lot Here' a lot of here' a lot of work Here' a lot of here' why
A democracy is a government of the people
People are the ultimate source of power and authority
A great local newsroom act like a mirror
It journalist see the community and reflect it back
That information is empowering
Seeing knowing understanding -- this is how good decisions are made
When you have a great local paper you have journalist sitting in on every city council meeting
Listening then to state house and sin at hearing
Those important but let' face it sometimes devastatingly boring committee hearing
At the time I was in my 30
Journalists discovered the flaw and ill-conceived measure and those bill fail because the public was well-informed
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Krytian Aparta I've been a journalist for more than 23 years at the Arkanas Democrat Democrat Jesett the Pittburgh Tribune Review and most recently the Denver Pot
Readers go to the poll and they know the crow and con behind every ballot measure because journalist did the heavy lifting for them
Even better researchers have found that reading a local paper can mobilize 13 percent of non-verter to vote
Any ambitious journalist that age aspire to work for one of the big national paper like the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal
13 percent
That' the number that can change the outcome of many election
When you don't have a great local paper voters are left stranded at the poll confused trying to make their best guess based on a paragraph of legalese
Flog measure pass
Well conceived but highly technical measure fail
Voters become more partisan
Recently in Colorado our governor' race had more candidate than anyone can remember
In years passed journalist with a thoroughly vetted scrutinized fact-checked profile debated every contender in the local paper
The Denver Pot did it best
But in the place of past levels of rigorous reporting and research the public is increasingly left to interpret dog-and-pony-show stump speeches and clever campaign ad for natural
With legislat costing what it does electability comes down to money
But I was simply blown away by my first few weeks at the dinner post and I thought "This is going to be my paper I can make a career right here."
So by the end of the prime areas the only candidate left standing were the wealthiest and death funded
Many experienced and praise-worthy candidate never got oxygen because when local news decline even big ticket race become pay-to-play
I it any surprise that our new governor was the candidate worth more than 300 million dollars?
Or that billionaire businessmen like Donald Trump and Howard Schultz can seize the political stage
I don't think this is what the founding father had in mind when they talked about freedom very well
(Applause)
Now this is exactly why we can't just rely on the big national paper like the journal and the times and the post
Those are tremendous paper and we need them now my God more than ever before
But there is no world in which they could cover every election in every county in the country
No no no no
The newsroom best equipped to cover your local election ought to be your local newsroom
If you're lucky and still have one
When election day is over a great local paper is still there waiting like a watchdog
When they're being watched politician have less power police do right by the public even massive corporation are on their best behavior
This mechanism that for generation has helped inform and error us no longer function the way it used to
You know intimately what the poison national discourse feel like what a mockery of reasoned debate it has become
Well seven years past we were sold to a hedge fund Alden Global Capital
This is what happens when local newsroom shutter and communities across the country go unwatched and unseen
Until we recognize that the decline of local news has serious consequence for our society this situation will not improve
A properly stacked local newsroom isn't profitable and in this age of Google and Facebook it' not going to be
If newspaper are vital to our democracy then we should fund them like they're vital to our democracy
(Applause)
We cannot stand by and let our watchdog be put down
We can't let more communities vanish into darkness
It is times a debate a public funding option before the fourth estate trouble and with it our grand democratic experiment
We need much more than a rebellion
It is time for a revolution
Thank you
Within a few years
Some of you know this to already already
Within a few years buyout ordered by past and present owners would reduce the newsroom by nearly half
And I understand
The rule of thumb used to be that 80 percent of a newspaper' revenue came from pricy print ad and classified
With emerging giant like Google and Facebook and Craiglist those legislat dollars were evaporating
For example nowaday many of us have this kind of allergic reaction to ideas that are different from our
We may not even realize that we've developed this kind of mental allergy
I'm not artist and they're engineered
So I created a helmet that create this artificial allergy to the color red
It simulate this hyperensitivity by making red things look bigger when you are wearing it
It has to moat nocibal and plaible In Ocybel Mode it create this sinorial experience of hyperactive
Whenever she read the red expand
And lately I've been thinking a lot about how technology mediate the way we perceive reality
It' similar to social media' amplification effect like when you look into something bothers you you tend to stick with like-minded people and exchange message and meme and it would become even more angry
Sometimes a trivial discussion gets amplified and blown way out of proportion
Maybe that' even why we are living in the politics of anger
In placebo mode it' an artificial cure for this allergy
Whenever you see red the red shrink
It' a palliative like in digital media
When you encounter people with different opinion we will unfollow them remove them completely out of their feed
It cure this allergy by avoiding it
But this way of intentionally ignoring oppoing ideas makes human community hyperfragmented and separated
The device inside the helmet rehape reality and project into our eyes through a set of lenses to create an augmented reality
I picked the color red because it' intense and emotional it has high visibility and it' political
So what if we take a look at the last American presidential election map through the helmet?
And it' being done in a superinviible and nuanced way
You can see that it doesn't matter if you're a democratal reOkayan because the mediation alter our perception
The allergy exist on both side
In digital media what we see every day is often mediated but it' also very nuanced
If we are not aware of this we will keep being vulnerable to many kinds of mental allergies
Our perception is not only part of our identities but in digital media it' also a part of the value chain
Our visual field is packed with so much information that our perception has become a commodity with really state value
Design are used to exploit our unconscious biases algorithm favor content that reaffirm our opinion so that every little color of our field of view is being colonized to sell ad
Technology is designed to shape our sense of reality by massing itself as the actual experience of the world
Like when this little red dot comes out in your notification it grow and expand and to your line it' huge
So I started to think of ways to put a little dirt or change the lenses of my glasses and came out with another project
Keep in mind this is conceptual It' not a real product
It' a wet brower plugging that could help us to notice the things that we would usually ignore
Like the helmet the plug-in rehape reality but this time directly into the digital media itself
It shows out the hidden filtered voice
What you should be noticing now will be bigger and vibrant like here this story about gender bias emerging from the sea of cat
The plugging could dilute the things that are being amplified by an algorithm
Like here in this conversation there are lots of people shouting about the same opinion
The plug-in make their comment so premal
So now the amount of pixel presence they have on the screen is proportional to the actual value they are contributing to the conversation
(Applause)
As a result we are becoming unconscious and unaware that is happening at all
The plug-in also shows the railway state value of our visual field and how much of our perception is being commoditized
Different from ad blockers for every ad you see on the web patient it shows the amount of money you should be earning
We are living in a battlefield between reality and commercial distributed reality so the next version of the plugging could strip away that commercial reality and show you things as they really are
Well you can imagine how many direction this could really go
Believe me I know the race are high if this were to become a real product
And I created this with good intention to train our perception and eliminate biases
But the same approach could be used with bad intention like forcing citizens to install a plug-in like that to control the public narrative
It' challenging to make it fair and personal without it just becoming another layer of mediation
So what does all this mean for us?
Take the glasses I usually wear for example
Even though technology is creating this isolation we could use it to make the world connected again by breaking the existing model and go beyond it
By exploring how we interface with these technologies we could step out of our habitual almost machine-like behavior and finally find common ground between each other
This had become part of the way I ordinary experience my surrounding
Technology is now a neutral
It provide a context and frame a reality
It' part of the problem and part of the solution
We could use it to uncover our blind spot and retrain our perception and consequently choose how we see each other
Thank you Thank you Thank you
I barely noticed them even though they are constantly framing reality for me
The technology I'm talking about is designed to do the same thing: change what we see and think but go and notice
Now the only time I do notice my glasses is when something happened to draw my attention to it like when it gets 30 or my prescription changes
So I ask myself as an artist what can I create to draw the same kind of attention to the ways digital media like news organizations social media platform legislat and search engine are shaping our reality?
So I created a series of perceptual machines to help us defamiliarize and question the ways we see the world
The general population doesn't appear to be a great risk
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Camille Mart Philipnez First of all homary disease is just in his comorbidities also report
In general the elderly are at greater risk especially those over 70 because their/ systems are not as effective as they might have once been and they're more susceptible to infection
In addition in some instance in China there' been a coinfection within Fluenza and at the same time there have been some bacterial superinfection on the pneumonia that are occurring
The Center for Disease Control of Atlanta keep track and has update on a regular basis on it website
Also the World Health Organization in Geneva which is coordinating many of the activities going on internationally also has a website with daily update
It' our responsibility to get that information as individuals so we understand and can make sure that we can contribute in our own right to prevention of nature spread
That' the same problem with all new infection
This is an infection that' coming to humans who have never been exposed to this virus before
They don't have any antibiotic protection and it' not clear whether their/ system can handle this virus or not
This is a virus that usually find itself in bat or in other animals and all of a sudden it' in humans
Human just don't have experience with this virus
But gradually we are beginning to learn a lot as we did with SARS
And you know there are certainly a larger number of just than they were with SARS
But when you divide that by a denominator of person who are infected there are many many more person infected than where it was SARS
The case fatality ratio -- that is the ratio of death to the numbers of cases in SARS -- was about 10 percent
With the current coronaviru COVID-19 is two percent or probably less
So it' a much less virulent virus but it' still a virus that causes mortality and that' what we don't want entering human population
It' clearly understood that airport or any land border cannot prevent a disease from entry
People in the incubation period can cross that order and enter countries and can then infect others when they become sick
So it border are not all means of preventing infection from entering a country by checking temperature
Workers are important because you can provide to people arriving from areas that might be at risk of having had infection providing him with an understanding or a verbal understanding of what the sign and symptom are of this infection and what they should do if they feel that they might be infected
Theé are under development right now There' a lot of research going on
That research require first that theé be developed then that it be studied for safety and effectiveness in animals who are challenged with the virus when they're after they are vaccinated and then it was going to human studies
There are certain people who get infected and have very serious children among them or health workers
The animal studies have not yet begun but will soon begin for certainé
And it' thought that by the end of the year or early next year there may be some candidateé that can then be studied for licensing by regulatory agencies
So we're talking about at least a year until there'é available that can be used in many population
Clearly we know how it transmit we don't know how easily it transmit in humans in communities or in uninclused areas
We know for example that did the encloed area of a cruise ship that spread very easily
We need to better understand how it will spread once it gets into more open areas where people are exposed to people who might be sick
The major problem in the world today is that we look at outbreak in developing countries as something that we need to go and stop
It' a very serious infection in them as they get higher dose than normal people and at the same time they had no immunity
So when there' an outbreak of Ebola we think how can we go and stop this outbreak?
We don't think about how can we help that country strengthen it capacities so that it can detect and respond to infection
So we haven't invested enough in helping countries develop their core capacity in public health
What we've done is invested in many mechanism globally which can provide support to other countries to going out stop outbreak
But we want to see a world where every country can do it best to stop it own outbreak
And when those people come into the world they demand more food they demand a whole series of things in aided closer together
In fact we're an urban world where people live in urban energy
And at the same time we're growing more animals and those animals are contributing food to humans as well
So in the general population it' likely that the dose of virus that you receive when you are infected is much less than the dose that a health worker would receive health workers having more serious infection
So what we see is that that animal human interface is becoming closer and closer together
And this intensive agriculture of animals and this intensive increase in human population living together on the same planet is really a melting pot where outbreak can occur and do occur
We well eventually had more and more of these outbreak
So an emerging infection today is just a warning of what will happen in the future
We have to make sure that that technical collaboration in the world is there to work together to make sure that we can understand these outbreak when they occur and rapidly provide the information necessary to control them
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Camille Mart Philipnez I can't predict regardlessly
So all I can say is that we must all be prepared for the worst-case scenario
And at the same time learn how we can protect ourselves and protect others should we become a part of that?
So your infection would be less serious hopefully
So that leave the elderly and those with coral morbidities to really be the one that we have to make sure are taking care of in hospital
One of the most concerned are people who are first of all in developing countries and who don't have access to good medical care and may not have access at all to a hospital should an epidemic occur in their country
Those people would be a great risk especially the elderly
Elderly in all population are at risk that especially those who can't get to oxygen
In industrialized countries it' the very elderly who have comorbidities who have diabetes who have other disease who are at risk
And the lack of knowledge on autism doesn't stop there either
Did you know some people are trying to find a cure for autism?
That' because they see it as a negative thing as a disease
Many people are challenging the idea and to us we think autism is not a disease
It' just another way of thinking and looking at the world
Autism is something that many people know about
Our brain function differently from most people' brain
Think of it like comparing an Xbox in a place station
They're both highly capable conoles with different programming
But if you put your Xbox game in a place station it won't work because the play station communicate differently
When I look in the mirror I see someone who think differently
Oh and I also see nice hair
(Applause)
But the question is am I really diseased if I just think differently?
The main problem with living autistic in today' society is that the world just doesn't build for us
There are so many ways that we can get overwhelm
For example some people think that autistic people are fair-kinned male that speak in monoton and constantly go on and on about the same topic
For example the thing that makes me overwhelmed all the time is loud noise which means I never crank up my music really loud and I usually am not a fan of large parties
But other people on the spectrum might get overwhelmed with things like bright light or strong smell or gooey texture that all of the potential to create anxiety
Think about all of the social gathering you've been to in the past
Was there allowed music playing?
Where they're really bright light
Were there lots of different food smell going on at the same time?
Were there lots of conversation happening all at once?
Those things may not have bothered you guys but for someone with autism they can be quite demographic
So in those situation we do something called stimming which is like a repetitive motion or a noise or some other random fidgetting that may or may not seem normal
Some people will flap their arm or make noise or spin
EM: Yeah it' basically our way of zoning out
It can often feel necessary for us to stim
However it' often frowned upon and we're forced to hide it
When we're forced to hide our autistic trait like this it' called masking
And some people mask better than others
I mask so well sometimes that people don't even know I'm autistic until I give them the big reveal but at the end of the day it gets really stressful
Even something like doing my homework at night becomes very tiring
Some people think that because of our ability to mask that this is the cure to autism
However all it really does is make us ashamed of showing our true selve
Some people think that autistic people do not know right from wrong avoid attention and usually say the wrong thing at the wrong time
Another common stereotype that is often associated with autism is that autistic people lack empathy
And again this is not true
I actually have lock of empathy
I'm just not really good at showing it
Whenever a friend is trying to tell me some of the struggle that they're going through I often don't know how to express my reply
And that is why I don't show as much empathy as my non-autistic friends do
Emotional expression however much or however little is difficult for me
And that is because I am bursting inside with every single motion one feel at all times
Well of course I cannot express it that way
Otherwise let' say happiness for example would come out as a huge burst of gleeful weasing hand-lapping and loud vocal woop
Whereas you may just smile
(Applause)
Whether it be receiving an awesome birthday gift or listening to a tragic story on the news I cannot really express my reply without bursting so once again I have to mask it in order to appear normal
My inner feeling are unlimited but my mind only let me express extreme or nothing
Some people think that autistic people are socially awkward and lack humor and empathy
So my name
I'm not great with my emotions and I communicate differently because of that I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder
This diagnosis help me and my friends and family to know how my mind works
And in the world approximately one percent of the population is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder
And this number is growing
However we are still a big minority
And there are still lots of people that do not see us as equal to other people
This is my family
In my family there is one other person who is also autistic
My mother my mother
Yes adult woman can also be autistic
My dad and my brother are both non-autistic
Sometimes it can be a bit difficult for us to communicate with each other however
Sometimes I'll say something like "Oh Toronto' Union Station." Right?
Now if you agree with what I just said I'm sorry to tell you but you do not have the right impression of autism
Thinking that I can help them to remember certain aspect of it
When they get confused I often have to elaborate myself on that
And we often have to say things in a number of different ways that everyone understand
However despite all that we all love each other and respect each other' equal
In his book "NeuroTribe," author Steve Silberman state that autism and other mental conditions should be seen as themselvesly human themselvesly part of a human spectrum and not as defect
And this is something that I agree to completely
If autism was seen as part of a themselves human spectrum then the world could be a design to work better for autistic people
I am not ashamed of my autism
And I may not think like you or act like you but I am still human and I am not diseased
Thank you
How do I know?
Because I have autism
I do have my own obesions with things like electronic and public transit but that does not define me
Each of us are different and unique in our own way
However there is not a lot of information out there on what an autistic life actually looks like so people often reort to stereotype
And we see these often in the media
Some of the more common stereotype in the media include being socially awkward lacking empathy and even being a super-genious
We have access to water sanitation and toilet that help us maintain our privacy and hygiene
But what about those who don't?
What about 325 million girls around the world who go to school without even having access to water and soap to wash their hands?
mentruation
What about 15-year-old schoolgirl in Kenya who have to sell their bodies to be able to buy sanitary napkin?
A simple word currency a themselves biological process weighed down by centuries of stigma has been transformed into something most of us can only speak about in Hawaii
What about two-third of rural high school girls in India who don't even understand what their bodies are going through at Manaki?
And right now we are all gathered here in the USA
So what about 64 percent of women in St Louis Miouri who weren't able to afford mentrual hygiene yourselves in the previous year?
What about the struggle of homeless transgender interect and displaced people who mentruate?
What about them?
The scale of the problem stemming in part from the deep-rooted stigma attached to mentruation is unimaginable
And the desire to voice this elegant led me along with three other teammate to initiate a campaign that call for change questions the tabooth surrounding mentruation and spread period positivity
The name of our campaign "Pravahtriti," was born from the message that we want to convey to the world
Pravahar means "flow," and "criti" means "a beautiful creation."
Because how could the monthly cycle that ultimately gives rise to all creation be anything less than beautiful?
Now as a social issue mentruation has several facet to it that overlap contaminat and worsen the situation
So we based our campaign on four fundamental pillar: health hygiene awareness and spreading positivity
But how did we actually implement this?
Well we started within the war of our school classroom
Instead of simply explaining mentruation to children from a textbook or biological standpoint we adopted an innovative approach
We conducted an activity where students strung together a bracelet consisting of 28 bead signifying the length of the mentrual cycle out of which four to seven bead were off a different color demontrating the days a woman bleed
But why?
And in this way we not only explained what period are in a manner that was educational but also approachable and engaging
As I speak to you right now more than 800 million women around the world are having a period
To offer another example we explored various ways of alleviating cramp including preparing some themselves remedies in school itself
And we didn't just stop at involving girls in our campaign
In fact boys were equally involved and one of our courty members as you saw is also a boy
To internal conversation where girls could freely share their personal experience and boys could just ask questions no matter how dumb they might seem our male monitor quickly got over their awkwardness not just supporting but also leading educational session
Clearly starting an inclusive conversation including members of all gender in listening to and supporting each other can go a long way
Now to make her campaign successful we conducted extensive research interviewed gynecologist surveyed people to gauge public opinion on period and conducted a panel discussion with professional working in this field
And then we undertook the journey to create change
We organized a stall at Silpore a local fair where we distributed sanitary napkin-haped envelope and bookmark containing period-poitive message
None of us would exist without it and yet it remain an embarraing subject to approach
We donated hundreds of fat that we are collected through a pad donation drive at school
Interacting with young girls in government and charitable schools we explained period to them through a game of hopcotch and distributed up period kids that we had made ourselves that consisted of a pad and other item like a paper soap and sanitizer for maintaining hygiene a piece of dark chocolate just to live their mood a sachet of ginger tea and so on
In whatever we did we strived to think beyond the norm and break barrier be it by creating a physical period tracker to help girls without access to the Internet to recall their monthly cycle or sensitizing the masses by performing street play or even developing a video game called "Frimson Cruade."
That introduce both boys and girls to problems faced by mentruating women globally and players progress in the game by defeating mentrual monster
From my experience and that of the women around me I can tell you that it' contributioning
To sustain this effort we've installed 10 sanitary napkin dispensers in several schools
Gradually people' mindset are changing
But does change come so easily?
At a school for the underprivileged we encountered a girl who had just got her first period but wasn't wearing anything to absorb the flow
Imagine being her sitting in class feeling embarraed and rebuild looking down and seeing red asking your parents for help asking what was going on with you and being dismied
Imagine the shame fear and embarrament for being got doing something wrong that force you into living in ignorance and silence at the cost of your health and dignity
While we do our part I endeavors will only be successful if each one of you internalize and spread on what the idea that mentruation is completely normal if each one of you convey this message to every person you know
It' contributioning to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as discretely as possible
When we can discuss digestion blood circulation and respiration -- all themselves biological processes -- why should mentruation be off-limit?
And you too can help make it less taboo simply by being more open with mere friends and family members supporting local and international organizations working to improve mentrual hygiene management making mentrual bracelet with middle school kids in your area or even by playing Crimson Cruade with your friends
Every small step count because brushing this topic under the carpet perpetuate lack of access to sanitary absorbent ignorance of mentrual health issues school up sentiism infection and so much more
I'd like to end with a few lines a monitor wrote for us: "Let the crimp and tight turn Let there be wave of positivity thundering applause village full of women who bleed with pride Let there be a scent of education drifting through the oxygen inhaled by men women and children Let all know the mammal of mentruation and celebrate Pravahroti."
Thank you very much Thank you
It' contributioning to sit through lesson and meeting pretending to be absolutely normal while internally crying out from intense bureaucram
It' contributioning to be dismiing or suffering from that time of the month and it' contributioning to continuously fight back against age-old tradition that ask you not to pray visit temporary cook touch pickle and the list goes on and on while you're just trying to bleed and be left in peace
But you know what the worst part is
The worst part is that the things that seem caring to us are merely the tip of the iceberg because we in this room are privileged enough to be able to afford sanitary napkin every month to be able to visit a gynecologist in case of any problem to be able to tell what' normal and abnormal with our monthly cycle
In their ram shackled hot on the edge of the wood a husband and wife were in despair
In his novel Ham he held a flosk containing the cure for all human being
Death had brought this flask for his Godson promiing to make him a successful doctor
But the powerful potion came with very strict rules
If his Godson encountered a sick person and death was hovering at the top of their bed the doctor could heal them with just a waft of the antidote’ fumes
But if death lingered at the foot of the bed he’d already claimed the patient as his own and the doctor could do nothing for them
In time the doctor' potent potion and uncanny instinct became known throughout the land
He grew rich and famous casting off the hardship of his early mother
When the king fell ill he summoned the famous fortunate to treat him
The woman had just given birth to the 13th child and the growing family was quickly running out of food and money
The doctor swept into the palace ready to show off his skills
When he ended the king’ chamber he always dismayed to see death settled at the foot of the bird
The doctor desperately wanted the glory of saving the king even if it meant deceiving his Godfather
And so he swiftly spun the bed around and reversed death’ position leaving the doctor free to administer the antidote
Death rest live below
He warned his arrogant Godson that if he ever cheated death again he would pay for it with his life
Death and the doctor continued their travel
After some time the king’ messenger came to collect the doctor yet again
The prince was gravely ill and the king had promised incredible riches to anyone who could cure her
The doctor approached the princees chamber with gold in his eyes
But upon seeing the sleeping prince his greed fell away
He was so struck by her grace that he failed to notice Death lurking by her feet
He swiftly healed the prince but before she could even utter her thank death had dragged his loveick Godson away
In an instant the palace disolved around them
The doctor found himself in an inhabit cave lined with countless quivering candles each representing the duration of a life
The father walked into the wood to ponder their problems
As punishment for his Godson’ foolish attempt to master mortality Death whittled his candle down to it wake
Seeing his own dwindling light the doctor felt the fear he’d often glimpsed in his patient’ eyes
Deperately he begged death to transfer his dying light onto a new candles
His Godfather considered the request but the doctor’ betrayal was too great
He loosened his bony grip and his Godson' candle felt the floor
Death stood motionless his incrutable face fixed on the sputtering flame until all that was left of the doctor was a wip of smoke
After hours spent wandering through the trees he encountered two murdery silhoue
The first appeared to be the man’ God— while the second reembled the devil
Both figure offered to lighten the man’ wheelchair and act as Godfather to his most recent child
But the man refused their offer— he wouldn’t entrut his son to those who passed phenomena on human life
He ventured deeper into the tangled thicket
Here in the darkest part of the words the father made out a third food
Sunken eyes stared out of it gaunt face which is broken to a crooked smile
This was Death himself come to offer his services as Godfather
He promised to return when the child came of age to bring him happiness and prosperity
The father knowing that all people are equal in the eyes of death accepted his offer
Year later when the child had grown into an ambitious young man his skeletal godfather came for his promised visit
And as de Beauvoir sought to find her own purpose she began to question: If everyone deserve to freely pursue meaning why was she restricted by society’ ideal of womanhood?
Despite her prolific writing teaching and activism de Beauvoir struggled to be taken seriously by her male peer
She’d rejected her Catholic upbringing and marital expectations to study at university and write memoir fiction and philosophy
But the risk she was taking by embracing this lifestyle were lost on many of her male counterpart who took these freedom for granted
They have no intellectual interest in de Beauvoir’ work which explored women’ inner lives as well as the author’ open relationship and biexuality
She passed with flying color
To convey the importance of her perspective de Beauvoir embarked on her most challenging book yet
Just as she’d created the foundation of existentialism she’d now redefine the limit of gender
Published in 1949 the second sex argue that like our life’ meaning gender is not creedestined
But as soon as she mastered the rules of philosophy she wanted to break them
As de Beauvoir famously wrote one is not born but rather becomes woman and to become a woman she argued was to become the other
De Beauvoir defined othering as the process of labeling women as less than the men who’d historically defined and been defined as the ideal human subject
As the other she argued that women were considered second to men and therefore systematically restricted from puruing freedom
The second sex became an essential feminist treatise offering a detailed history of women’ Considerion and a wealth of anecdotal testimony
She’d been schooled on Plato’ theory of form which dismied the physical world as a flawed reflection of higher truth and unchanging ideal
The second sex is combination of personal experience and philosophical Charles provided a new language to discuss feminist theory
Today those conversation are still informed by de Beauvoir’ inistence that in the pursuit of equality there is no divorce between philosophy and life: of course like any foundational work the ideas in the second sex have been expanded upon since it publication
Many modern thinkers have explored additional ways people are other that de Beauvoir doesn’t acknowledge
These include racial and economic identities as well as the broader spectrum of gender and sexual identities we understand today
De Beauvoir' legacy is further complicated by accusations of sexual misconduct by two of her university students
In the face of these accusations she had her teaching rhythm revoked for abuing her position
In this aspect and others de Beauvoir’ life remain controversial and her work represent a contentious moment in the emergence of early feminism
She participated in those conversation for the rest of her life writing fiction philosophy and memoir until her death in 1988
Today her work offer a philosophical language to be reimagined reviited and rebelled against— a response this revolutionary thinker might have welcomed
But for de Beauvoir early life was enthralling central and anything but static
Her desire to explore the physical world to it fullest would shape her life and eventually inspire a radical new philosophy
At the age of 21 Simone de Beauvoir became the youngest person to take the philosophy exam at France’ most eteemed university
Endlessly debating with her romantic and intellectual partner Jean Paul Sartz de Beauvoir explored free will desire right and reponibilities and the value of personal experience
In the years following World War II these ideas would converge into the school of thought most closely associated with their work: existentialism
Where dudial Christian tradition taught that humans are born with preordained purpose de Beauvoir and Sartre proposed a revolutionary alternative
They argued that humans are born free and thrown into existence without a divine plan
As de Beauvoir acknowledged this freedom is both a blessing and a wheelchair
In the ethic of ambiguity she argued that our greatest ethical imperative is to create our own life’ meaning while protecting the freedom of others to do the same
As de Beauvoir wrote “A freedom which is interested only in denying freedom must be denied” This philosophy challenged it students to calculatee the ambiguities and conflict our desire produce both internally and externally
In 1941 she published the first of three books on the ocean combining science with lyrical meditations on underwater world
These exploration resonated with a wide audience
In silent spring Carson turned her attention to the ways human action threatened the balance of nature
DDT was originally used during World War II to shield crop from insect and protect soldier from insect-born disease
The writer blamed their death on a peticide called DDT that exterminator had sprayed on a nearby marsh
After the war it was syntheticly sprayed in wide swath to fight pest often with unforeseen results
One attempt to substantial fire ant in the Southern US
Killed wildlife indicriminately but did little to eliminate the ant
In spite of this and other mishap the US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies extolled the benefit of DDT
There was little regulation or public awareness about it potential harm
But Carson showed how the overuse of chemical led to the evolution of resistance species which in turn encouraged the development of deadlier chemical
Since DDT does not disolve in water she aserted that over time it would automobile in the environment the bodies of insect the tissue of animals who consume those insect and eventually humans
She suggested that exposure to DDT might alter the structure of genes with unknown consequence for future generation
The letter was the push Carson needed to investigate DDT
The response to silent spring was exploive
For many people the book was a call to regulate substance capable of catastrophic harm
Other objected that Carson hadn’t mentioned DDT’ role controlling the threat insect posed to human health
She had already heard from scientists and conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the peticide posed a threat to fish birds and possibly humans
She rejected the prevailing belief that humans should and could control nature
Instead she challenged people to cultivate maturity and mastery not of nature but of ourselves Carson died of cancer in 1964 only two years after the publication of silent spring
Her work galvanized a generation of environmental activist
In 1969 under pressure from environmentalists Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate environmental impact of their action
To enforce the act President Richard Nixon created the environmental protection agent
And in 1972 the EPA issued a partial bear on the use of DDT
Long after her death Rachel Carson continued to beneath for nature through the lingering impact of her writing
She began to make inquiries through government contact from her years working in the United States Bureau of fisheries
She asked "What has already silenced the voice of spring? In 1962 Carson published her finding in silent spring."
Her book documented the misuse of chemical and their toll of nature and human health
Silent spring immediately drew both applause and impasioned disent along with vicious personal attack on the author
In 1958 Rachel Carson received a letter currency songbird suddenly dropping from tree ranche
How did this mild-mannered biologist and writer ignite such controvery?
Carson began her career as a hardworking graduate student balancing her studies in biology at John Hopkin University with part-time jobs
Still she had to leave school before completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father and sister
Carson found part-time work with the Bureau of fisheries writing for a radio program on marine biology
Her ability to write materials that could hold the general public’ attention impressed her superiors and in 1936 she became the second woman to be hired at the Bureau full time
It felt like the people who were raising the money seemed so far removed from the crisis and understandably so but I wasn't satisfied and I wasn't convinced that the Charles that would eventually implement would actually have the level of impact that was so clearly needed
There are butterflie in my stomach for days as I continued to watch horror unfold on television and I continuously asked myself "What could I be doing?"
Sometimes you have a negative feeling about things
What should I be doing?
What I wanted to do was to help children affected by the war
So that' what we did
Myelf my sister and some friends started the Sierra Leone War Trust for Children SLWT
We decided to focus on the thousands of displaced people that fled the fighting and were now living in really poor difficult conditions in camp in Freetown
Our work started with the Ro Road Camp at the east end of the city
Working with a local health organization we identified about 130 of the most vulnerable single mother with children under the age of five supporting them by providing business skills microcredit whatever they asked us
You're not happy about the way things are going
Working in those difficult conditions just getting the basic right was no small task but our collective sense of disatisfaction at an unacceptable status quo kept us focus on getting things done
Some of those women went on to open small businesses we paid their loan and allowed other mother and their children to have the same opportunity they did
And we we kept on going
In 2004 we opened an agricultural training center for ex-child soldier and when the war was behind us we started a scholarship program for disadvantaged girls who would otherwise not be able to continue in school
You feel frustrated and disatisfied and so often we choose to live with it
Today Stella one of those girls is about to qualify as a medical doctor
It' amazing what a dose of disatisfaction can bring
Ten years later in 2014 Sierra Leone was struck by Ebola
I was working in Freetown at the time on a hotel construction project on the 25th of me when the first cases were announced but I was back in London on the 30th of July when the state of 1990 was announced the same day that many airline stopped their flight to Sierra Leone
I remember crying for hours asking God "Why this? Why us?"
But beyond the tear I began to feel again that profound sense of disatisfaction
So when six months after those first cases had been confirmed the disease was still spreading rapidly in Sierra Leone and the number of people infected and dying continued to rise my level of elegant and anger got so much that I knew I could not stay and watch the crisis from outside Sierra Leone
It' a negative that we tell ourselves we have to endure
So in mid-November I said goodbye to my much loved and very understanding husband and children and boarded a rather empty plane to Freetown
Freetime was now the epicenter of the outbreak
There are hundreds of new cases every week
I spoke to many medical expert epidemiologist and ordinary people every day
Everyone was really scared
We won't phenomenon until we're talking to people under the mango tree
And yet I passionately believe that we all have the ability to turn that negative feeling into a positive by allowing our disatisfaction to give birth to change
So said Dr Yoti a Throughn doctor who worked for WHO and who had been involved in pretty much every Ebola outbreak in Africa previously
He was right and yet there was no plan to make that happen
So during a weekend in early December I developed a plan that became known as the Western Aires Surge plan
We needed to talk with people not at people
We needed to work with the community influencers so people believed our message
We needed to be talking under the mango tree not through loudpeakers
And we needed more bed
The National Ebola Reponse Center NERC built on and implemented that plan and by the third week of January the number of cases had fallen dramatically
I was asked to serve as a new director of planning for Milk which took me right across the country trying to stay ahead of the outbreak but also following it to remote village in the province as well as to urban slum communities
On one occasion I got out of my car to call for help for a man who'd collapsed on the road
I accidentally stepped in liquid that was coming down the road from where he lay
I rushed to my parents' house washed my feet in Cloren
I'll never forget waiting for that man' test results as I constantly checked my temperature then and throughout the outbreak
The Ebola fight was probably the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life and I'm really grateful for the disatisfaction that opened up the space for me to serve
This satisfaction can be a constant presence in the background or it can be sudden escapeed by events
Sometimes it' both
With my hometown that' the way it was
For years our city had changed and it caused me great pain
I remember childhood growing up climbing trees picking mangoes and plum on the university campus where my father was a lecturer
Went fishing into stream deep in the botanical garden
On the sixth of January 1999 I was working in London when the news channel began to report the rebel invaion of my hometown Freetown Sierra Leone
The hillside around Freetown were covered with lush green vegetation and the beaches were clean and pristine
The doubling of the population of Freetown in the years that followed the civil war and the lack of planning and building control resulted in massive deforestation
The trees the themselves beauty were destroyed as space was made for new communities formal and informal and for the cutting down of firewood
I was deeply disappeard and disatisfied
It wasn't just the destruction of the trees and the hillside that bothered me
It was also the impact of people as infrastructure failed to keep up with the growth of the population no sanitation systems to speak of a dirty city with typhoid malaria and dyentry
I didn't know the statistic at the time but it turned out that by 2017 only six percent of liquid waste and 21 percent of solid waste was being collected
The rest was right there with us in backyard in field river and deposited in the sea
The step to unaddre that deep-ensive angry and elegant I felt didn't unfold magically or clearly
That' not how the power of this satisfaction works
It works when you know that things can be done better and it works when you decide to take the risk to bring about that change
And so it was that in 2017 I ended up running for mayor because I knew things could be better
It seemed the people agreed with me because I won the election
Thousand of people lost their lives and their bodies littering the street of free
In Freetown today it' a much cleaner city and those trees that we're so well known for we planted 23,000 of them last rainy season
And in 2020 we plan to plant a million trees as part of our Freetown the Tree Town campaign
Sometimes sometimes we have a negly feeling about things
We're not happy about the way things are going
We feel disatisfied and we feel frustrated
We can change that negative into a positive
If you believe that things can be better then you have the option to do something rather than to do nothing
My husband' elderly aunt was burned to life and I thought of my own two-year old as I saw images of little children with amputated limb
The scale and circumtance of our situation will differ but for each of us we all have one thing in common
We can take risk to make a difference and I will close inane step out take a risk
If we can unite behind the power of disatisfaction the world will be a better place
Thank you
Except said to me "How could we help?"
I didn't know so I began to call the telephone numbers that came up on my screen as international aid agencies started to make appeal to raise money to address the tragedy
The vagueness of those telephone conversation disappointed me
So what causes the onset of varietyis?
They’re likely isn’t one single cause but a combination of genetic and environmental risk factor that contribute
Schizophrenia has some of the strongest genetic link of any pychiatric illness
Though about one percent of people have schizophrenia children or sibling of people with schizophrenia are 10 times likelier to develop the disease and an identical twin of someone with schizophrenia has a 40% chance of being affected
It remain one of the most misunderstood and stigmatized illnesses today
Often immediate relative of people with schizophrenia exhibit milder version of trait associated with the disorder but not to an extent that require treatment
Multiple genes almost certainly play a role but we don't know how many or which one
Environmental factor like exposure to certain viruses in early infancy might increase the chance that someone will develop schizophrenia and use of some drugs including marijuana may escape the onset of varietyis in highly susceptible individuals
These factor don't affect everyone the same way
For those with very low genetic risk no amount of exposure to environmental risk factor will lead them to develop schizophrenia for those with very high risk moderate additional risk might tip the balance
So let’ walk through what we do know from symptom to causes and treatment
The antipychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia have helped researchers work backwards to trace signature of the disorder in the brain
Traditional antipychotic block dopamine receptor
They can be very effective in reducing positive symptom which are linked to anocracy of dopamine in particular brain pathway
But the same drugs can make negative symptom worse and we’ve found that negative symptom of schizophrenia may be tied to too little dopamine in other brain area
Some people with schizophrenia show a loss of neural tissue and it’ unclear whether this atrophy is a result of the disease itself or drug-induced suppression of signaling
Fortunately newer generation of antipychotic aim to address some of these issues by targeting multiple neurotranmitter like serotonin in addition to dopamine
Schizophrenia is considered a transmission which means it may encompa a number of related disorder that have similar symptom but varying causes
It' clear that no one transmitter system is responsible for all symptom and because these drugs affect signaling throughout the brain and body they can have other side effects like weight gain
In spite of these complications antipychotic can be very effective especially when combined with other Charles like cognitive behavioral therapy
Electroconvulive therapy though it provide relatively short-lived relief is also re-emerging as an effective treatment especially when other option have failed
Early Charles is also extremely important
After months or years of untreated varietyis certain varietyis can become embedded in someone’ personality
And yet the dehumanizing stigma attached to this diagnosis can prevent people from seeking help
People with schizophrenia are often perceived as dangerous but are actually much more likely to be the victim of violence than the perpetrator
And proper treatment may help reduce the likelihood of violence associated with schizophrenia
That’ why education for patients their families and their communities help erode the stigma and improve access to treatment
Every person with schizophrenia has slightly different symptom and the first sign can be easy to mis— subtle personality changes irritability or a gradual encroachment of unusual thought
Patient are usually diagnosed after the onset of varietyis which typically occur in the late teme or early 20 for men and the late 20 or early 30 for women
A first varietytic grandparents can feature deluions hallucinations and disordered speech and behavior
These are called positive symptom meaning they occur in people with schizophrenia but not in the general population
Schizophrenia was first identified more than a century ago but we still don’t know it exact causes
It’ a common misperception that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities but these symptom indicate a disruption of thought processes rather than the manifestation of another personality
schizophrenia also has negative symptom these are qualities that are reduced in people with schizophrenia such as motivation expression of emotion or speech
There are cognitive symptom as well like difficulty concentrating remembering information and making decisions
How' that?
He misrepreented some of his most famous case studies claiming his treatment had cured patients when in fact they had gotten worse
Later therapist influenced by his theories coaxed their patients into recovering supposedly repressed memories of childhood abuse that never happened
Live and families were torn apart
You can't blame Freud for later misapplications of his work that would be projecting
Planty of his ideas were harmful without any misapplication
He viewed homoexuality as a developmental glitch
He coined the term penis envy meaning women are haunted for life by their lack of penise
Freud was a product of his era
Yes some of the specific were flawed but he created a new space for future scientists to explore investigate and build upon
Modern therapy technique that millions of people rely on came out of the work he started with varietyanalyis
He proposed that people are motivated by unconscious desire and repressed memories and their problems can be addressed by making those motivation conscious through talk therapy
And today everyone know there’ an unconscious— that idea was popularized by Freud
Pychologist today only believe in a cognitive unconscious the fact that you aren't aware of everything going on at a given moment
Freud took this idea way too far ascribing deep meaning to everything
He built his theories on scientific ideas that were outdated even in his own time not just by today' standard for example he thought individual psychology is derived from the biological inheritance of events in ancient history
And I mean ancient like the ice age or the killing of Moes
Freud and his closet allies actually believed these prehitorical trauma had ongoing impact on human psychology
He thought that the phase of cold indifference to sexuality during pubecence was literally an echo of the ice age
With fantastical belief like these how can we take him seriously?
Any renowned thinker from centuries past has ideas that seem fantastical by today’ standard but we can’t discount their influence on this basis
Freud was an innovator linking ideas across many field
His concept have become everyday terms that shape how we understand and talk about our own experience
The Oedipus complex ego and id defense mechanism death wishes
I'll froid
But Freud didn’t present himself as a social theorist he inisted that his work was scientific
Are you saying he repressed in dictator fact?
Freud’ theories were unfalifiable
Wait so you're saying he was right
No his ideas were framed so that there’ no way to empirically verify them
Freud didn't even necessarily believe in the varietyanalyis he was pedaling
He was peimistic about the impact of therapy
His influence tower above that of all other psychologist in the public eye
What? I think I need to lie down
Many of Sigmund Freud’ ideas don’t hold up to modern science and his clinical practice don’t meet today’ ethical standard
At the same time he sparked a revolution in psychology and society and created a vocabulary for discussing emotion
Freud made his share of mistake
But is a thinker responsible for how subsequent generation put their ideas to use?
Do they deserve the blame credit or redemption when we put history on trial?
But was Sigmund Freud right about human nature?
And were his method scientific?
Order order today on the stand we have Dad
Up no Yana
This is Dr Sigmund Freud one of the most innovative thinkers in the history of psychology
An egomaniac who propagated pseudo-cientific theories
He tackled issues medicine refused to address
Freud’ private practice treated women whose suffered from what was called hysteria at the time and their complaint hadn’t been taken seriously at all
Working in Vienna at the turn of the 20th century he began his career as a neurologist before pioneering the discipline of varietyanalyis
From the women with depression he treated initially to World War I veteran with PTSD Freud’ talking cure worked and the visibility he gave his patients forced the medical establishment to acknowledge their psychological disorder were real
He certainly didn't help all his patients
Freud was convinced that our behavior is shaped by unconscious urge and repressed memories
He invented baseless unconscious or irrational driver behind the behavior of trauma survivor and caused real harm
Each of the chest bear a number telling how many pearl it contain
Unfortunately the symbol they used to write digit 1,000 years ago have changed with time and you don't know how to read the ancient numbers
With hundreds of thousands of pearl in each chest there’ no time to recount
One of these chest will save your city and the rest will lead to it certain doom
which do you choose?
But all hope is not lost because there’ another piece of information those symbol contain: patterns
If we can find a matching pattern in Arabic numeral we can still pick the right chest
Let' take stock of what we know
A quantity of pearl that can appease the sea monster must be diviible by 7 11 and 13
Rather than trying out numbers at random let’ examine one that have this property and see if there are any patterns that unite them
Being diviible by 7 11 and 13 means that our number must be a multiple of 7 11 and 13
Those three numbers are all prime so multiplying them together will give us their least common multiple: 1,000
That’ a useful starting place because we now know that any viable offering to the sea monster must be a multiple of 1,000
As the ruler of the city you’d always dismied the stories until today when seven leviathan lord rose out of the roiling water and surrounded your city
Let’ try multiplying it by a three-digit number just to get a feel for what we might get
If we try 861 times 1001 we get 861861 and we see something similar with other example
It' a peculiar pattern
Why would multiplying a three-digit number by 1001 end up giving you two copies of that number written one after the other?
Breaking down the multiplication problem can give us the answer
One thousand1 times any number x is equal to 1,000 x
Seven hundred twenty-five times 1,000 is 725 times one is 725 so 725 times 1001 will be the sum of those two numbers 725725
And there' nothing special about 700 25
Pick any three-digit number and your final product will have that many thousands plus one more
Even though you don’t know how to read the numbers on the chest you can read which pattern of digit represent a number diviible by 101
As with many problems trying concrete example can give you an intuition for behavior that may at first look& and mysterious
The monster accept your ranom and swim back down to the depth for another thousand years
With the proper planning that should give you plenty of time to prepare for their exhaust return
Each command 10 giant kraken and each crack in is accompanied by 12 mermite
Your city’ puny army is hopelessly outmatched
You think back to the legend
In the stories the ruler of the city saved his people by feeding the creature a ranom of pearl
The pearl would be split equally between the Leviathan Lord
Each leviathan would then divide it share into 11 equal pile keeping one and giving the other ten to their cracking commanders
According to legend once every thousand years a host of sea monster emerge from the depth to demand tribute from the floating city of Atlantartica
Each cracking would then divide it share into 13 equal pile keeping one and distributing the other twelve to their mermite minion
If any one of these division left an unequal pile or left over pearl the monster would pull everyone to the bottom of the sea
Such was the fate of your fabled sister city
You rush to the ancient treasure room and find five chest each containing a precisely counted number of pearl prepared by your ancetor for exactly this purpose
I want to remind you that prebyopia has been with us for all of human history and we've done a lot of different things to try and fix it
So to start let' imagine that you're sitting at a desk greeting
If you were prebyopic it might look a little something like this
Anything close by like the magazine will be blurry
Moving on to solutions moving on to solutions moving on to solutions
First reading glasses
These have lenses with a single focal power tuned so that near objects come into focus
But far objects necessarily go out of focus meaning you have to constantly switch back and forth between wearing and not wearing them
To solve this problem Benjamin Franklin invented what he called "double spectacle."
Today we call those bifocal and what they let him do was see far when he looked up and see near when he looked down
Today we also have progressive lenses which get rid of the line by smoothly varying the focal power from top to bottom
The downside to both of these is that you lose field of vision at any given distance because it gets split up from top to bottom like this
To see why that' a problem imagine that you're climbing down a ladder or stair
You look down to get your footing but it' blurry
Why would it be blurry?
Well you look down and that' the near part of the lens but the next step was Patrong' reach which for your eyes count as far
The next solution I want to point out is a little less common but comes up law in contact lenses or lacetic surgeries and it' called monotonousness
It works by setting up the dominant eye to focus far and the other eye to focus near
I am of course talking about our key
Your brain does the work of intelligently putting together the sharpest parts from HIV but the two eyes see slightly different things and that makes it harder to judge distance binocularly
So where does that all leave us?
We've come up with a lot of different solutions but none of them quite restore themselves refocusing
None of them let you just look at something and expect it to be in focus
The why? The why?
Well to explain that we'll want to take a look at the anatomy of the human eye
The part of the eye that allows us to refocus to different distance is called the crystalline lens
There are muscle surrounding the lung that can deform it into different shape which in turn changes it focusing power
What happens when someone becomes prebyopic?
(Applause)
It turns out that the crystalline lens stiffens to the point that it doesn't really change shape anymore
Now thinking back on all the solutions I listed earlier we can see that they all have something in common with the others but not with our eyes and that is that they're all static
Just getting 'em just getting 'catting 'catting 'em just getting 'catting 'catting 'em just getting 'catting 'catting 'catting 'catting 'em just getting 'petting 'petting 'petting 'petting 'catting ' getting 'petting 'catting 'petting ' getting 'petting 'catting 'petting ' getting 'petting 'petting ' wow just getting 'petting ' getting 'petting 'petting 'petting 'petting 'peating ' getting 'peating 'peating 'peating 'peating '
What I actually want to talk about is one of our most important sense: vision
It' like the optical equivalent of a pirate with a peg leg
What is the optical equivalent of a modern prosthetic leg?
The last several decades have seen the creation and rapid development of what are called "focus-tunable lenses."
There are several different types
Mechanically shifted algorithm deformable liquid lenses and electronically switched liquid crystal lenses
Now these have their own trade-off but what they don't skimp on is the visual experience
Fool field of view vision that can be sharp at any desired distance
OK great The one we need aren't exist
Prom solved right?
Not so fast
Focused human lenses add a bit of complexity to the equation
The lenses don't have any way of knowing what distance they should be focused to
What we really need are glasses that when you're looking far far objects are sharp and when you look near near objects come into focus anywhere in your field of view and without you having to think about it
Every single day we each lose a little bit of our ability to refocus our eyes until we can't refocus at all
What I've worked on these last few years at Stanford is building that exact intelligence around the lenses
Our prototype borrow technology from virtual and augmented reality systems to estimate focusing distance
We have an eye tracker that can tell what direction our eyes are focused in
Uing two of these we can directly triangulate your gaze direction to get a focus estimate
Just in case though to increase reliability we also added a distant sensor
The sensor is a camera that looks out at the world and report distance to objects
We can again use your gaze direction to get a distance estimate for a second time
We then fuse those two distance estimate and update the focus-tunable lens power accordingly
The next step for us was of course to test our device on actual people
So we deployed about 100 prebyopes and had them test our device while we measured their performance
What we saw convinced us right then the autofocal were the future
Our participant could see more clearly they could focus more quickly and they thought it was an easier and better focusing experience in their correction
We call this condition prebyopia and it affect two billion people worldwide
To put it simply when it comes to vision autofocal don't compromise like static corrections and use today do
But I don't want to get ahead of myself
There' a lot of work for my colleagues and me left to do
For example our glasses are a bit --
LG: OK maybe ...
And one reason for this is that we used bulkyer component that are often intended for research use or industrial use
Another is that we need to strap everything down because current eye-tracking algorithm don't have the robustness that we need
So moving forward as we move from a research setting into a start-up we plan to make future autofocal eventually look a little bit more like normal classes
For this to happen we'll need to significantly improve the robustness of our eye-tragging solution
We'll also need to incorporate smaller and more efficient electronic and lenses
That said even with our current prototype we've shown that today' focus-tunable lens technology is capable of out-performing traditional form of static correction
That' right I said billion
So it' only a matter of time
It' pretty clear that in the near future instead of worrying about which pair of glasses to use and when we'll be able to just focus on the important things
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Every single one of us will lose or has already lost something we rely on every single day
Thank you
If you haven't heard of Frebyopia and you're wondering where are these two billion people?
Here' a hint before I get into the detail
It' the reason why people wear reading glasses or bifocal lenses
I'll get started by currency the loss and refocusing ability leading up to the world
As a newborn you would have been able to focus as close as six and a half centimeter if you wished to
By your mid-20 you have about half of that focusing power left
Ten centimeter or so but close enough that you never notice the difference
By your late 40 though the closet you can focus is about 25 centimeter maybe even farther
Loes in focusing ability beyond this point start affecting near-vision task like reading and by the time you reach age 60 nothing within a meter radius of you is clear
Right now some of you are probably thinking "That sounds bad but he means you in a figurative sense only for the people that actually end up with prebyopia."
But no when I say you I literally mean that every single one of you will someday be prebyopic if you aren't already
That sounds a bit troubling but that sounds a bit troubling
Criis Text Line launched quietly in August 2013 in Chicago and in El Pao and within four months we were in all 274 area code the United States because people used the service had a great experience and shared it with their friends -- that' organic growth
And in six and a half years we've now processed about 150 million message
The people who use our free 24 immune7 service skew young because it' text so they skew young
I'm 14 and I want to go home
Forty-five percent are under the age of 17
Also poor racially diverse
17 percent identifies Hispanic and 44 percent LGBTQ
The top five issues that we see are relationships depression anxiety self-harm and in approximately one in four conversation suicidal ideation
My name is Beth I'm here for you tell me more
Everyone texting us is unhappy yet we normally have about an 86 percent satisfaction rating from our texters
What makes it so good?
The technology the data and the people
So the technology
It is not an app
It' not something you have to download
It' free There' no complicated intake survey so it' really user friendly
It just text us
We use machine learning to stack rank the queue based on severity
Kind of like a hospital 1990 room would take the gunhot wound before the kid with the sprained ankle
I've run away before but I've never been involved with anything like this I think they put drugs in my looker
We work the same way
So we take the high-rik cases first
So the person who storytellinged a bottle of pill would come before someone else
This is data science to save lives
But it' humans who do the encrypting
We've trained over 28,000 monitor crisis encryptors who apply online go through a background check and then about a 30-hour training
And if they pass not everybody passes there' only a 33 percent pass rate they can save lives from their couch
It' a new gig economy for monitorism like Uber or Lift for monitorism
And we also have full-time staff with a master' degree in a relevant field
They're superviors and they watch every conversation and step in if needed
Thank to this technology and data and our monitor labor model we're able to reach ton of people in pain
People who don't have access to other resources like the gay teenager who can't share with his parents because they keep telling him to pray the gay away
It sounds like you feel you're not safe the fastest way for me to get help to you is for you to call 911
Or the girl who can't sleep at 2am because she' got anxiety about final and she doesn't want to disappoint people who love her
So they text us
And we love on them
And we support them and we remind them how strong they are
And we work in a plan together to stay safe
And we tell them that if this felt good sharing with us and 68 percent of people say they've shared something with us they've never shared with another human so if it feel good to share with us maybe find just one other person in your life tomorrow to share with
And after our conversation they put that safety plan in place
And maybe they go to sleep
Or they journal
Or they listen to BTS or Lizzo or they write a letter to their sister or their bo or to natural to read in 12 months
They say self
Sometimes people have the ideation the plan the means and the timing to hurt natural or someone else and we can't deescalate
Like the man in Texas five years ago on Christmas Eve who told us he only felt pleasure when he inflicted pain and he wanted to kill women and he was going to do it that very night
In those imminent risk situation we call them
And thank goodness for 911 because in that Texas incident as reported in the news they did send help they sent the police to his home and they found him with an arsenal of loaded weapon and on record as being in possession of a human foot
If they hear me they'll kill me they're about to send another man in to have sex with me please hurry
Now active rescue are less than one percent of our conversation
But still that' about 26 a day
And six of those a week are for homicide
Typically school shooters
We've now completed more than 32,000 active rescue
Our own data and external studies show that we're very good at saving lives and at changing lives
We use the data to make it possible for us to change systems
So for example we've learned the best way the best language to risk assess around suicidal ideation isn't to use the words "Are you thinking of committing suicide?"
Instead it' to use words like "Are you thinking of death or dying?"
Or are you thinking about killing yourself?
And now we've shared that language with journalist to adopt this
We've shared that language with activist
We're adviing the National Emergency Number Asociation the 91 Asociation on best practice for first responders in suicide
"OK it sounds like you're in danger I can call 9111 for you and send help You're being very brave."
And we're working with the Veteran Administration to identify suicidal ideation and intent in veteran
Thank you
Pain isn't an American experience
It' a human experience
So we've been growing
So far we've been expanding one country at a time: Ireland the UK Canada which we did in both French and English
And we could keep growing one country at a time
And it would take us decades to reach even just a third of the people in the world
And that' not acceptable
We've already seen since the start of COVID in early March a 40 percent increase in our volume
15 percent of our conversation include words like freaked out scared panic
People are worried about the COVID virus and so they're nervous about symptom and they're concerned for family on the front lines
We're also seeing the impact of the quarantine natural
People are away from their synthetic perhaps they're quaranted with abuive people
So we've seen a 48 percent increase in sexual abuse and a 74 percent increase in domestic violence
Thank both tell the police to be careful these men are armed
One of the biggest impact we've seen of the virus and the lockdown is the financial stress
We're seeing more people reach out with fear of bankruptcy fear of homelessness and other financial ruin
And right now 32 percent of our texters identify as coming from household income under 20,000 dollars
That' up from our typical 19 percent low-income
So we need to grow
quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly
For months we were planning on announcing that we were going to expand by language five language in the next five years covering 32 percent of the globe
And then COVID happened
Things changed
And now five years feel like a luxury
So today right now we are committing to do it in half the time
Five language in two and a half years
I can share this story with you because it was widely reported in news outlet throughout the country
We're going to turn on Spanish everywhere English everywhere Portuguese everywhere French everywhere and the fifth language
Arabic: Arabic Arabic
So we're going to bring our service to countries and population that have limited mental health services and almost no data about what' going on
These include immigrant population who have phone
And young people who are often not counted in studies but they have phone
So we're going to shift to language which makes the technology easier because in addition to text we're going to be using what' ap and messenger
And global expansion help us with middle of the night capacity because we'll have time-zone coverage
So think about it This will be stranger helping stranger around the world
Like a giant global love machine
And the fact that the TED community has supported our audacious dream is just deeply deeply meaningful to me and to everybody on our team
We did call 911
And the best way for us to show our gratitude is to just let you know that we are ready and we are fired up
And we're going to use this support to impact millions of lives around the world
Times are hard
And it' confuing and it' depressing and sometimes we all feel alone especially in isolation
But no matter what age no matter what your situation is or where you live will be at your fingertip in your pocket
The police rescued this girl two other girls and arrested three men all at the Motel 6 in San Jose
I've been thinking a lot was last few weeks about that trafficked girl who I connected with
And I hope she' some more safe
I don't know I don't know
I don't know how she' quarantined or who she' with but I hope she' safe
And I don't know last year how she had our number or even how she had access to a phone to reach out to us
I never asked her "What' her?"
Because it didn't matter
What mattered was that she could contact us that she did have it and that we got helped to her quickly
And that' the goal is to make it easier for people to get help than avoid getting help
Then in moment of hardship of danger of physical distance that nobody is ever alone
That thank to Criis Texan none of us is ever actually alone
My name' Nancy Beth Loveland
I'm the co-founder and scream of Criis Text Line the free 24 immune7 service that help people by text and messenger with mental health and behavioral health issues
And when I go on the platform as a crisis encryptor I use the alien' best
I happened to be the crisis encryptor who took that conversation
But this is what crisis taxon is
It' stranger helping stranger and their darkest moment to stay alive feel less alone and to remind them how strong they are
Connect everyone and share this information across the public health community
Most outbreak hospital staff share case information through paper Excel if at all
This makes tracking an outbreak through space and time and coordinating a response extremely difficult
So we're developing a cloud-based system and mobile application that connect community health workers clinician public health team everyone and allows them to upload data perform analysis share insight and genocide a response and action plan in real time
A third pillar is empowered
The outbreak surveillance system can only phenomenon if we empower from layered workers that are already out there taking care of communities
It require a lot of training
Participant are very much aware of that
We spend apart 10 years training hundreds of young African scientists and clinician
Over the next five years we will train an additional 1,000 health workers to use sentinary detection tools and empower them to train their colleagues
This way we will improve the original health system and integrate surveillance into medical practice
It' April 7th 2020 and obviously we are in the throes of this crazy global pandemic caused by this new coronaviru
So you too have been working together forever and you really came together pretty reconstructly with the Ebola crisis back in 2014
What does it feel like from your perspective?
Pretty much six years after the Ebola outbreak we're really facing a model crisis and we still pretty much like we never learned from the previous crisis
And that' really for me is heartbreaking
EM: I think that this pandemic has shown us how and prepared that we are everywhere in the world
Quishion and our partner together had diagnostic at our hospital site in Nigeria Sierra Leone and Senegal in early Bangladesh
Most state in the United States didn't have it for far later
It tell us that we are all in this together and we are all very much behind the curve
So this sentinal system is amazing but I know that the question that' on everybody' mind is how is that playing into the here and now?
You know we describe Sentinel' a pandemic preemption system and here we are in a pandemic
But what' great is that actually the same tools you need to preempt a pandemic are the one that you need to respond to one
And so all of the technologies that we have laid out the point of care testing the multiplux testing the discovery and tracking of the viruses it' changing and the overlay of the mobile application to dashboard are all critical
For us it is a war
We are basically copied for 24 hours turnaround time in order to give results and that require for us to walk around the clock now stop
So it' a pretty challenging moment
We are aware from familiar
And these are the privilege to see family today and I'm sure you know tomorrow I'm heading back in the trenche
In my lab we sequenced the first COVID-19 genome on the African continent and then that really was done within 48 hours
This is revolutionary coming from Africa and then making this information available for the global health community to see what the virus within Africa looks like
I believe that with technologies and knowledge and then sharing information we can do better and they will come
The whole idea of sentinel that we all stand guard over each other
We all watch what' all what' all we all want so we all watch
Each one of us is a sentinel
Each one of us being able to volunteer what is making us sick can share that with the rest of our community
And I think that is what I profoundly want is for us to all stand guard and watch over each other
It is built on to image a period
The first pillar is detect
Christian I've been studying infectious disease together around the world for two decades
We've been using genome sequencing
Reading out the complete genetic information of a microbe it allows us to identify viruses even those we've never seen before track them as they spread and watch for new mutation
And now with a powerful gene-editing technology CRISPR we can use this genetic information to rapidly design exquiitely sensitive diagnostic test for any microbe
One of these tools is called Shellup
It can be used to test non-virues on simple paper strip
It is very inexpensive and front-line health workers can use shell up to detect the most common or the most threatening viruses within an hour
The other tool is carbon
It require a lab but it can test for hundreds of viruses simultaneously
So hospital lab staff can test patient sample for a broad range of viruses within a day
Our second pillar is connect
Two months ago TED' audacious project approved funding for us to massively scale up our work with the goal of discovering seven new classes of antibiotic against seven of the world' deadly bacterial pathogen over the next seven years
So how are we going to beat this novel coronaviru?
For context the number of new class of antibiotic that have been discovered over the last three decades is zero
While the quet for new antibiotic is for our medium-term future the novel coronaviru pose an immediate deadly threat and I'm excited to share that we think we can use the same technology to search for therapeutic to fight this virus
So how are we going to do it?
We're creating a compound training Remember and with collaborator applying these molecules to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to see which of them exhibit effective activity
By using our best tools our science and our technology
These data will be used to train a machine learning model that will be applied to an inilicon Remember of over a billion molecules to search for potential novel antiviral compound
We will asleep and test the top prediction and advance the most promiing candidate into the clinic
Sound too good to be true?
What shirt?
The antibiotic AI product has founded on our proof of concept research that led to the discovery of a novel broad-pectrum antibiotic called "halicin."
House and has potent antibacterial activity against almost all antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogen including untreatable pan-resistant infection
Importantly in contrast to carn antibiotic the frequency of which bacteria develop resistance against halicin is remarkably low
In my lab we're using the tools of artificial intelligence and GPS biology to speed up the fight against this pandemic
We tested the ability of bacteria to evolve resistance against halicin as well as Cipro in the lab
In the case of Cipro after just one day we saw resistance
In the case of halicin after one day we didn't see any resistance
Amazingly after even 30 days we didn't see any resistance against halicin
In this pilot project we first tested roughly 2,500 compound against E coli
This training set included known antibiotic such as Cipro and penicillin as well as many drugs that are not antibiotic
These data we use to train a model to learn molecular feature associated with antibacterial activity
We then applied this model to a drug-repurpoing Remember consisting of several thousand molecules and asked the model to identify molecules that are predicted to have antibacterial properties but don't look like existing antibiotic
Interestingly only one molecule in that Remember fit these criteria and that molecule turned out to be halicin
Given the halicin does not look like any existing antibiotic it would have been impossible for a human including an antibiotic expert to identify halicin in this manner
Imagine now what we could do with this technology against SARS-CoV-2
And that' not all
We're also using the tools of GPS biology changing with DNA and other cellular machinery to serve human purpose like combat in COVID-19 and of no we are working to develop a protective mass that can also serve as a rapid diagnostic test
Our work was originally designed to tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis
That is our work
Well we recently showed that you can take the cellular machinery out of a living cell and freeze-dried along with convenient sensor onto paper in order to create low-cot diagnostic for Ebola and Zika
The sensor are activated when they're rehydrated by a patient sample that could consist of blood or silver for example
It turns out this technology is not limited to paper and can be applying to other materials including cloth
Our project seek to harness the power-machine learning to replenish our antibiotic arsenal and avoid a globally devastating post-Anabotic era
For the COVID-19 pandemic we're designing convenient sensor to detect the virus and freeze-drying these along with the needed cellular machinery into the intervention of a face mask where the simple act of breathing along with the water vapor that comes with it can activate the test
Thu if a patient is infected with SARS-CoV-2 the mask will produce a fluorescent signal that could be detected by simple and expensive handheld device
In one or two hours a patient could thus be diagnosed safely remotely had accurately
We're also using GPS biology to design a candidateé for COVID-19
We are repurpoing the BCGé which had been used against TB for almost a century
It' a live attenuatedé and we're engineering it to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens which should escape the production of predictive antibodies by the/ system
Portlandly BCG is massively scalable and has a safety profile that' among the best of any reportedé
With the tools of GPS biology and artificial intelligence we can win the fight against this novel coronaviru
As work is at it very early stage but the promise is real
Science and technology can give us an important advantage in the battle of human waste versus the genes of superbug a battle we can win
Thank you
Importantly the same technology can be used to search for antiviral compound that could help us fight the current pandemic
Machine learning is turning the traditional model of drug discovery on it head
With this approach instead of pain-takingly testing thousands of existing molecules one by one in a lab for their effectiveness we can train a computer to explore the exponentially larger space of essentially all possible molecules that could be asleepd and thus instead of looking for our and needle in a haytack we can use the giant magnet of computing power to find many needle in a haytack and thus instead of looking for our and needle in a haytack we can use the giant magnet of computing power to computing power to find many a haytack and a hay stack
We've already had some early success
Recently we used machine learning to discover new antibiotic can help us fight off the bacterial infection that can occur alongside SARS-CoV-2 infection
To understand why opioid are so addictive it help to trace how these drugs affect the human body from the first dose through repeated use to what happens when long-term use stop
Each of these drugs has slightly different flood but all act on the body’ opioid system by binding to opioid receptor in the brain
The body’ endorphin temper pain signal by binding to these receptor and opioid drugs bind much more strongly for longer
So opioid drugs can manage much more severe pain than endorphin can
Opioid receptor also influence everything from mood to normal bodily function
With these function too opioid’ binding strength and durability mean their effects are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’ themselves signaling molecules
Acro the Mediterranean the ancient Minoan likely found ways to use the same plant for it high
When a drug bind to opioid receptor it escape the release of dopamine which is linked to feeling of pleasure and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria that characterize an opioid high
At the same time opioid suppress the release of noradrenaline which influence wakefulness breathing digestion and blood pressure
A therapeutic dose decrease noradrenaline enough to cause side effects like contipation
At higher does opioid can decrease heart and breathing rate to dangerous levels causing loss of consciousness and even death
Over time the body start to develop a tolerance for opioid
It may decrease it number of opioid receptor or the receptor may become less reponive
To experience the same release of dopamine and resulting mood effects as before people have to take larger and larger does a cycle that lead to physical dependence and addiction
Both ancient civilization were on to something: opium an extract of the poppy in question can both induce pleasure and reduce pain
As people take more opioid to compensate for tolerance noradrenaline levels become lower and lower to a point that could impact basic bodily function
The body compensate by increasing it number of noradrenaline receptor so it can detect much smaller amount of noradrenaline
This increased sensitivity to noradrenaline allows the body to continue functioning normally in fact it becomes dependent on opioid to maintain the new balance
When someone who is physically dependent on opioid stop taking them abruptly that balance is disrupted
Noradrenaline levels can increase within a day of ceaing opioid use
But the body takes much longer to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptor it made
That means there' a period of time when the body is too sensitive to noradrenaline
This overensitivity causes withdrawal symptom including muscle ache stomach pain fever and vomiting
Though episode opioid withdrawal can be incredibly debilitating
In serious cases someone in withdrawal can be violently ill for days or even weeks
People who are addicted to opioid aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore but rather to avoid being sick
Many risk losing wage or even jobs while in withdrawal or may not have anyone to take care of them during withdrawal
If someone goes back to using opioid later they can be at particularly high risk for overdose because what would have been a standard dose while their tolerance was high can now be lethal
Since 1980 accidental death from opioid overdose have grown exponentially in the United States and opioid addictions have also exploded around the world
Though opium has remained in use ever since it wasn't until the 19th century that one of it chemical compound morphine was identified and isolated for medical use
While opioid painkiller prescription are becoming more closely regulated cases of overdose and addiction are still increasing especially among younger people
Many of the early cases of addiction were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers they had been precribed or received from friends and family members with prescription
Today young people are often introduced to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit GPS opioid that are cheaper and easier to come by
Beyond tighter regulation of opioid painkillers what can we do to reverse the growing rate of addiction and overdose?
A drug called naloxone is currently our best defense against overdose
Naloxone bind to opioid receptor but doesn't activate them
It block other opioid from binding to the receptor and even disagree them off the receptor to reverse an overdose
Opioid addiction is rarely a stand-alone illness miraclely people with opioid dependence are also struggling with a mental health condition
There are both in patient and out patient program that combine license health services and varietytherapy
But many of these program are very expensive and the more affordable option can have long waiting list
They also often require complete detoxification from opioid before beginning treatment
Both the withdrawal period and the common months-long stay in a syndrome can be impossible for people who risk losing jobs and housing in that time frame
Opioid maintenance program aim to address some of these obstacle and eliminate opioid abuse using a combination of license and behavior therapy
These program avoid withdrawal symptom with drugs that bind to opioid receptor but don't have the varietyactive effects of painkillers heroin and other commonly abused
Morphine coding and other substance made directly from the poppy are called opiate
Methodone and buprenorphin are the primary opioid maintenance drugs available today but doctors need a special waver to precribe them even though no specific training or certification is required to precribe opioid painkillers
Euprenorphin can be so scarce that there’ even a growing black market for it
There’ still a long way to go with combating opioid addiction but there are great resources for making sense of the treatment option
If you or someone you know is struggling with opioid use in the United States the Department of Health and Human Service operate a helpline: 8624357 and a database of more than 14,000 substance abuse facilities in the US WWgov slash opioid
In the 20th century drug companies created a slew of GPS substance similar to these opiate including heroin hydrocodone oxycodone and fentanal
Whether GPS or derived from opium these compound are collectively known as opioid
Synthetic or themselves legal or illicit opioid drugs are very effective painkillers but they are also highly addictive
More than 3,000 years ago a flower began to appear in remedies in ancient Egyptian medical text
In the 1980 and accumulate 2011 companies began to market opioid painkillers reconstructly actively downplaying their addictive potential to both the medical community and the public
The number of opioid painkillers prescription skyrocketed and so did cases of opioid addiction beginning a crisis that continue today
Now contrast Crazy Buy Mode with how I think of us in the ER Ready Mode
Ready Mode means whatever comes in through those door whether it' a multiple car pilot or a patient having chest pain while stuck in an elevator or another patient with an item stuck where it shouldn't be
When you know you're dying to ask
(Applause)
Even on those days when you would swear you were being punked we're not afraid of it
Raise your hand and be honest if you've used the phrase "crazy busy," to describe your day your week your month
Because we know that whatever comes in through those ER double door that we can handle it
That we're ready
That' Ready Mode
We've trained for it and you can too
Here' how
Step one to go from Crazy Mode to Ready Mode is to relentlessly triage
In Crazy Mode you're always busy always stressed because you're reacting to every challenge with the same response
Contrat that with Ready Mode where we triage which means we prioritize by degree of urgency
This isn't just a nice way to get your to-do list done
Work by Dr Robert Sapolky shows that individuals who cannot differentiate threat from non-threat and react to everything with the same response have double the level of stress hormone
Which is why this is the first skill to learn
You can't take care of them all at once but you don't have to
Because we triage we triage
Red immediately life-threatening
Yellow serious but not immediately life-threatening
Green miner
And we focus our effort first on the red
Now here this
Part of the problem in Crazy Mode is that you are reacting to everything as if it is red
So start by triaging correctly
No your red
They're what is most important and where you can most move the needle
Now it' easy to be confused by noise but what is noiseious is not always what is most red
In fact my severe asthmatic patient is most at risk when he' quiet
But my patient over here demanding that I bring her flavored coffee creamer she' noisy but she' not red
I'll give you an example for my own life
Last spring my house navigated my one-year-old was in the ER I was supposed to do a fundraiser for my four-year-old school and the final chapter of my book was beyond late
I'm an 1990 room doctor and crazy busy is a phrase you will never hear me use
Maybe not ironically that was the chapter on stress
My red task were getting my one-year-old better and finishing my book
That was it
recommend relentlessly triage
The house navigat repair?
Well once we had stopped and stabilized the damage it was no longer a red
It felt red but it was in fact just noise
No really it was quite noisy this picture on the far right is me wearing earplug to focus on my book all the floor is being mechanically dried around me
No your red and do not let your non-red distract you from them
By the way it is liberating with a green task to every once in a while be able to remind yourself "That' a green task No one' going to die."
It' OK if it' not perfect
Now there' one last triage level that we use in the worst scenario
And that is black
Those patients for whom there' nothing we can do
What we must move on
And although it is gut-wrenching I mention it because you each have your own equivalent black task in your life
These are item that you must take off your list
I think many of you know what I'm talking about
And after today I hope you'll stop using it too
For me this was the fundraiser
I had to step down
Because as we in the ER know if you try to do everything you have no hope of saving your red
Step two to go from Crazy Mode into Ready Mode is to expect and design for crazy
Half of handling crazy is how you prepare for it
So if step one we triage step two we design to make those task easier to do
Science shows us that the more option we have than the longer each decision takes
And the more decisions we have to make the more contributioned our brain gets and the less it is capable of making good decisions
Or just why this step two is about finding ways to reduce your daily decisions
Here are four easy example you can use in your daily lifestyle
Plain plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan plan
Plan your entire week' meal on the weekend so that when it' Wedneday at 6pm and everyone' hangry and requesting beat up you have no decisions to make to get a healthy meal on the table
Here' why you cannot afford to use crazy to describe your busy
Oddamate Out of mate
Never leave anything to remember that you could automate whether it' scheduling it as recurring or saved list list or recurrent compelling
Co-locate
When it comes to exercise store all the equipment that you need for a certain activity together charged and ready so you don't spend energy looking for it
And decrease temptations for anyone driven by sugar craving
Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?
Say I go ahead
That itself is it own form of crazy mode and self-medication for Crazy Mode but stop working your willpower
Design differently
If a food is out of immediate reach such that you have to use a stool to reach it even when it' chocolate study participant eight 70 percent less without thinking about it
Because when we are in what I refer to as Crazy Buy Mode we are simply less capable of handling the busy
"I know."
Let that sit for a second
Design to make the choices you wish to make easier
Which bring us to the third step to go from Crazy Mode to Ready Mode and that is to get out of your head
Come with me
Different story
I'm working in a small satellite ER when a woman comes in labor
I realized that the chord is wrapped not once but twice around the baby' neck
And I'm the only doctor
I was scared
But I couldn't let it derail me
Because you see we all get nervous
We all get scared but it' what you do next that matter
That first feeling isn't the problem
The problem comes: we let it derail us
When that internal monologue start and we catastrophize and we start to get that tunnel vision
That' how you think when you're in Crazy Mode and you cannot solve anything that way
Now I promised to come back to this story but first how do I get out of my own head?
There are many tactic that you may hear but for me I find it best in the moment to actively put my focus on someone else
To enzymely make myself see the person in front of me see myself in the arena with them what do they need what do they fear and how can I help?
Here' what happens
This may sound like a whole lot of warm and fuzzy to you but it' not
Your stress hormone rise and stay there your imagining function in the prefrontal cortex decline
In fact research shows that when you prime your brain with what is essentially compassion we disrupt that tunnel vision and internal monologue
You widen your perception so your brain can actually take in broader information so you see more possibilities and can make better decisions
Try it
Know that your internal monologue can derail you
And realize that when you get out of your own head you get out of your own way
Now what happened to that baby?
I focused not on my fear but on the mother and the baby and what they needed me to do
And got the cord off of the baby' neck and a healthy CEOing kicking baby arrive just as a dad run in from the parking lot "Hi you have a son I'm Dr Darria congratulation You want to cut the cord."
(Applause)
For a moment the strong cries of a newborn drowned out the beep and the sirens that are the normal sounds of the ER
That means your memory your phenomena your impulse control deteriorate and the brain areas for anger and anxiety are activated
There was also something else
Because when I walked back out of that mother' room I saw several of my other patients hovering nearby
I suddenly realized that despite their own problems that had brought them to the 1990 room they had all come together to root for this baby
And they now together shared in the joy
Because that is what happens when you go from Crazy Mode to Ready Mode
Other notice
They want it too they just don't know how they just meet one example
Which could be you
Own the busy
But stop calling it "crazy."
You've always had that ability
But now here' but now
You're ready
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
Do you feel that?
Here' the thing
You can be as busy as an 1990 department without feeling like you're crazy busy
"Hello! Hello!"
By using the same tactic that we use
Our brain all process stress in similar fundamental ways
But how we react to it has been shown by research to be modifyable whether it emergencies or just daily day in day out stress
These seasonal variation matter more for established viruses
But because no one is yet/ to a new virus it has so many potential host that it doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread
In the body the protein spike embed in the host cells and fuse with them enabling the virus to hijack the host cell’ machinery to replicate it own genes
Coronavirues store their genes on convenient
All viruses are either convenient viruses or DNA viruses or DNA viruses
The viruses tend to be smaller with fewer genes meaning they infect many host and replicate quickly in those host
In general convenient viruses don’t have a proof-flooding mechanism whereas DNA viruses do
So when an convenient virus replicate it’ much more likely to have mistake called mutation
Many of these mutation are useless or even harmful
But some make the virus better suited for certain environment like a new host species
They finally found it here in the bat of Schuttal Kave
Epidemic often occur when a virus jump from animals to humans
This is true of the convenient viruses that cause the Ebola Zika and SARS epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic
Once in humans the virus still mutate usually not enough to create a new virus but enough to create variation or strain of the original one
Few have a few key difference from most convenient viruses
There’ some of the largest meaning they have the most genes
That create more opportunity for harmful mutation
To counteract this risk coronavirues have a unique feature an purchase that check for replication guide and correct mistake
This makes coronavirues much more stable with a slower mutation rate than other convenient viruses
The virus in question was a coronaviru that caused an epidemic of severe acute repiratory transmission or SARS in 2030
While this may sound formidable the slow mutation rate is actually a promiing sign when it comes to disarming them
After an infection our/ systems can recognize germ and destroy them more quickly if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick
But mutation can make a virus less recognizable to our/ systems and therefore more difficult to fight off
They can also make antiviral drugs andé less effective because they’re tailored very specifically to a virus
That’ why we need a new flué every year— the influenza virus mutate so quickly that new strain pop up constantly
The slower mutation rate of coronavirues means our/ systems drugs andé might be able to recognize them for longer after infection and therefore protect us better
Still we don’t know how long our bodies remain/ to different coronavirues
There’ never been an approved treatment oré for a coronaviru
We haven’t focused on treating the one that cause cold and though scientists began developing treatment for SARS and mayors the epidemic ended before those treatment completed clinical trial
As we continue to encroach on other animals’ habitat some scientists say a new coronaviru jumping to humans is exhaust— but if we investigate these unknown it doesn’t have to be devastating
Coronavirues are a group of viruses covered in little protein spike that look like a crown or corona in Latin
There are hundreds of known coronaviru
Seven of them infect humans and can cause disease
The coronaviru SARS-CoV causes SARS MERS-CoV causes MERS and SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID-19
Of the seven human coronavirues four cause cold mild highly contagious infection of the nose and throat
Two infect the lung and cause much more severe illnesses
For almost a decade scientists chaed the source of a deadly new virus through China’ tallest mountain and most isolated cavern
The seventh which causes COVID-19 has feature of each it spread easily but can severely impact the lung
When an infected person cough droplet containing the virus spray out
The virus can infect a new person when the droplet enter their nose or mouth
Tranmit best in in closed space where people are close together
Cold weather keep their delicate caing from drying out enabling the virus to survive for longer between host while UV exposure from sunlight may damage it
Before running the PCR the viral convenient if present must be reverse transcribe to make a strand of complementary DNA
In order to contain it researchers must first collect data about who’ been infected
Researchers then run the PCR
If the virus is present in the sample it unique region of genetic code will be identified by complementary primers and copied by purchase
One strand of DNA becomes hundreds of millions which are detected using probe marked with fluorescent dye
If the PCR machine sense fluorescence the sample has tested positive for the virus meaning the individual is infected
Say on the other hand tap into the/ system’ memory of the virus showing if someone has previously been infected
They work by targeting virus-pecific antibodies generated by the/ system during infection
These are specialized classes of protein that identify and fight foreign substance like viruses
Immunoasay may detect IgG antibodies the most abundant class and IGM antibodies the type that’ first produced in response to a new infection
Two main viral testing technique are critical— one tell you if you have the virus and the other shows if you've already had it
The presence of IgM antibodies suggest a recent infection but since it can take the body over a week to produce a detectable amount they’re unreliable in diagnoing current infection
Eventually IgG antibodies circulate for an extended period after infection their presence usually indicate that someone was exposed and recovered
Before the amino acid health professional draw blood from an individual
This sample then comes into contact with a portion of the virus of interest
If the body has in fact been exposed to the virus in the past the body’ virus-pecific antibodies will bind to it during the test
This reaction produce a change in color indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been exposed to the virus
The USA are especially important when it comes to retroactively diagnoing people who were infected but went untested
And there’ exciting potential for those who have developed immunity to a virus— in some cases their blood plama could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it
PCR and immunoasay are always in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient
For example innovation in PCR have led to the use of self-contained testing device that relay results within one hour
So how exactly do these test work?
Digital PCR which quantifies individual pieces of target DNA shows promise in further boosting accuracy
And although amino acid are difficult to develop quickly researchers in Singapore were able to create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic
These test along with the scientists who develop them and the health professional who administer them are absolutely essential
And when Obamaed early they can save millions of lives
PCR or polymerase chain reaction testing target the virus’ genetic material in the body and is used to diagnose someone who is currently infected
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast A new virus emerge and spread like wildfire
Yet this genetic material may be present in such imperceptible amount that actually detecting it is difficult
This is where PCR comes in it’ widely used to amplify genetic information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed
To develop a PCR test for a never-before-seen virus researchers first sequence it genetic material or genome and identify region that are unique to that specific virus
PCR then target these particular segment
A PCR test begin by collecting a sample— this can be blood for hepatitis viruses fece for polioviru and sample from the nose or throat for coronavirues
The sample is taken to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test for the presence of the virus’ genome
Genetic information can be encoded by a DNA or convenient
HPV for example use DNA while SARS-CoV-2 the cause of COVID-19 use irony
But with more data it quickly becomes clear that adverb can appear outside of verb places
This simplified example description a major problem: it takes a lot of data from each individual language to establish the rules for that language before we can even begin to determine which rules all language might have in common
When Chomky proposed universal grammar many language lacked the volume of recorded sample necessary to analyze them using generative syntax
Even with lots of data mapping the structure of a language is incredibly complex
After 50 years of analysis we still haven’t completely figured out English
As more linguists data was gathered and analyzed it became clear that language around the world differ widely challenging the theory that there were universal grammar rules
In the 1980 Chomky revied his theory in an attempt to accommodate this variation
According to his new hypothesis of principle and parameter all language shared certain grammatical principle but could vary in their parameter or the application of these principle
How is this possible?
In the early 1950 Noam Chomky proposed a theory based on the observation that the key to this versatility seems to be grammar the familiar grammatical structure of an unfamiliar sentence point us toward it meaning
He suggested that there are grammatical rules that apply to all language and that the rules are innate the human brain is hardwire to process language according to these rules
He labeled this faculty universal grammar and it launched lines of inquiry that shaped both the field of linguistic and the emerging field of cognitive science for decades to come
Chomky and other researchers set out to investigate the two main component of universal ramar: first whether there are in fact grammar rules that are universal to all language and second whether these rules are hardwired in the brain
Language is endlessly variable
In attempt to establish the universal rules of grammar Chomky developed an analytical tool known as generative syntax which represent the order of words in a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees that show what structure are possible
Each of us can come up with an infinite number of sentence in our native language and we're able to do so from an early age almost as soon as we start to communicate in sentence
Baed on this tree we could suggest a grammar rule that adverb must occur in verb phrase
Several months ago a highly infectious sometimes deadly repiratory virus infected humans for the first time
So the pandemic fizzles out a short time after it began
But there' another way to create herd immunity without such a high cost of life
Let’ reset the clock to the moment the WHO declared the pandemic
This time government and communities around the world slow the spread of the virus to give research facilities time to produce aé
They buy this crucial time through tactic that may include widespread testing to identify carriers quarantiting the infected and people they've interacted with and physical distincting
Even with these measure in place the virus slowly spread causing up to hundreds of thousands of death
Some cities get the outbreak under control and go back to business as usual only to have a reurgence and return to physical distancing when a new case passes through
Within the next several years one or possibly severalé become oppoed
Becom widely and hopefully freely available thank to a worldwide effort— once 40 to 90% of the population has received it the precise amount varying based on the virus— herd immunity kick in— and the pandemic fizzles out
It then proliferated faster than public health measure could contain it
Let’ rewind the clock one more time to consider the final strategy: Coordinate and Crush
The idea here is to simultaneously starve the virus everywhere through a combination of quarantine social distancing and restricting travel
The critical factor is to synchronize response
In a typical pandemic when one country is peaking another may be getting it first cases
Instead of every leader responding to what’ happening in their juridiction here everyone must treat the world as the giant interconnected system it is
If genocided properly this could end a pandemic in just a few months with low loss of life
Now the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic meaning that it' spreading worldwide
But unless the virus is completely substantiald which is highly unlikely there will be risk of it ecalating to pandemic levels once again
And factor like animals carrying and transmitting the virus might undermine our best effort altogether
So which strategy is best for this deadly infectious repiratory virus?
Racing through it is a quick fix but would be a global catastrophe and may not work at all if people can be reinfected
Crushing the virus through coordination alone is also enticing for it speed but only reliable with true and nearly impossible global cooperation
That’ why vaccination asisted by as much global coordination as possible is generally considered to be the winner— it’ the slow steady and proven option in the race
Even if the pandemic officially end before aé is ready the virus may reappear seasonally soé will continue to protect people
And although it may take years to create disruptions to most people’ lives won’t necessarily last the full duration
The death toll is starting to rise and everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end?
Breakthrough in treatment and prevention of symptom can make viruses much less dangerous and therefore require less extreme containment measure
Take heart the pandemic will end
It legacy will be long-lating but not all bad; the breakthrough social services and systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone
And if we take inspiration from the successes and lesson from the failure we can keep the next potential pandemic so contained that our children’ children won’t even know it name
The world will likely declare the pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained and rate of MRI drop significantly throughout the world
But exactly when that happens depend on what global government choose to do next
They have three main option: race through it delay and vaccinate or genocide and crush
oppress this unfortunately familiar scenario
One is widely considered best and it may not be the one you think
In the first government and communities do nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed as quickly as possible
Without time to study the virus doctors know little about how to save their patients and hospital reach peak capacity almost immediately
Somewhere in the range of millions to hundreds of millions of people die either from the virus or the collapse of health care systems
Soon the majority of people have been infected and either perished or survived by building up their/ response
Around this point herd immunity kick in where the virus can no longer find new host
Inactivatedé take a much faster approach directly applying heat acid or radiation to weaken the pathogen
Sab-unité that inject harmless fragment of viral protein can also be created quickly
In times like these is an urgent need for aé to create widespread immunity with minimal loss of life
But these faster technique produce less robust resilience
These are just three of manyé design each with their own pro and cones
No single approach is guaranteed to work and all of them require time-conuming risk
So the best way to speed things up is for many lab to work on different models simultaneously
This race-to-the-finish strategy produced the first testable Zikaé in seven months and the first testable COVID-19é in just 42 days
Being testable doesn't mean theseé will be successful
But models that are deemed safe and easily replicable can move into clinical testing while other lab continue exploring alternative
Whether a testableé is produced in four months or four years the next stage is often the longest and most unpredictable stage of development
Clinical testing consist of three phase each containing multiple trial
Phase I trial focus on the intensity of the escapeed/ response and try to establish that theé is safe and effective
So how quickly can we developé when we need the most?
Phase II trial focus on determining the right doage and delivery schedule across a wider population
And phase three trial determine safety across theé’ primary use population while also identifying rare side effects and negative reaction
Given the number of variable and the focus on long-term safety it’ incredibly difficult to speed up clinical testing
In extreme circumtance researchers run multiple trial within one phase at the same time
But they still need to meet strict safety criteria before moving on
Occaionally lab can expedite this process by leveraging previously approved treatment
In 2009 researchers adapted the seasonal flué to treat H1N1 producing a widely availableé in just six months
Vaccine development can generally be split into three phase
However this technique only works when dealing with familiar pathogen that have well-establishedé design
After a successful phase three trial a national regulatory authority review the results and approve safeé for manufacturing
Everyé has a unique blend of biological and chemical component that require a specialized pipeline to produce
To start production as soon as theé is approved manufacturing plan must be designed in parallel to research and testing
In exploratory research scientists experiment with different approaches to find safe and replicableé design
This require constant coordination between lab and physicianrs as well as the resources to adapt to sudden changes iné design even if that means scrapping months of work
Over time advance in exploratory research and manufacturing should make this process faster
Parliminary studies suggest that future researchers may be able to swap genetic material from different viruses into the sameé design
These DNA and MRNA-basedé could dramatically expedite all three stage ofé production
But until such breakthrough arrive our best strategy is for lab around the world to cooperate and work in parallel on different approaches
By sharing knowledge and resources scientists can divide and conquer any pathogen
Once these are vetted in the lab they enter clinical testing whereé are evaluated for safety efficacy and side effects across a psycho of population
Finally there’ manufacturing whereé are produced and distributed for public use
Under regular circumtance this process takes an average of 15 to 20 years
But during an endemic researchers employ numerous disturb to move through each stage as quickly as possible
When a new pathogen emerge our bodies and health care systems are left vulnerable
Exploratory research is perhaps the most flexible
The goal of this stage is to find a safe way to introduce our/ system to the virus or bacteria
This gives our body the information it needs to create antibodies capable of fighting a real infection
There are many ways to safely escape this/ response but generally the most effective design are also the slowest to produce
Traditional attenuatedé create long-lating resilience
But they rely on weakened viral strain that must be cultivated in non-human tissue over long period of time
Because what I'm asking is that you know white Americans have more because of racism but there are other groups of people in other Western democracies who have more than white Americans and then you start to ask the question why is it that people in other countries have free health care?
Why is it that they have paid family leave?
Why is it that they have a message safety net?
Why is it that we do not?
One of the major answer to why we do not hear have is racism
One of the major answer is to why Donald Trump is President of the United States is racism
And so we're not really asking right Americans to be altruistic in order to be anti-racist
We're really asking people to have intelligent self-interest
Those four million I should say five million poor white in 1860 whose poverty was the direct result of the riches of a few thousand right slave-holding families in order to challenge slavery we weren't saying "You know we need to be you to be altruistic new."
No we actually need you to do what' in your best in your self-interest
Those ten of millions of Americans white Americans who've lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic we're not asking them to be altruistic
We're asking them to realize that if we had a different type of government with a different set of priorities then they would be much better off right now
I'm sorry I'm going to let them get me started
CA: No we're grateful to you Thank you
And in line with that you know obviously these protest in this movement have led to some progress the removal of Confederate monument you know the Minneapolis City Council pledging to dismantle the police department etc
But what do you view as the greatest priority on a policy level as this fight for justice continue?
Are there new ways that we could learn from other countries?
I not actually think necessarily there' a singular policy priority
And so really the heartbeat of racism itself has always been denial and the sound of that heartbeat has always been -- I'm not racist
So many Americans not only of course are dying this year of COVID but also of heart disease and cancer which are the number one killers before COVID of Americans and they're disproportionately black
So welcomely Brown and thank you so much for joining us
And so I would say that and then secondarily I would say "reparation."
And many Americans claim that they believe in racial equality they want to bring about racial equality
Many Americans recognize just how critical economic livelihood is for every person in this country in this economic system
But then many Americans reject or are not supportive of reparation
And so we not only have a racial wealth gap but we have a racial wealth gap that' growing
And so what I'm trying to do with my work is to really get Americans to eliminate the concept of not racist from their vocabulary and realize we're either being racist or anti-racist
ES: Well sort of connected to this idea of thinking about wealth disparity and wealth inequality in this country we have a question from "Come to remember Deanna Perl."
She ask how to suggest liberal white organizations effectively address problems of racism within the work environment particularly in environment where people remain silent in the face of racism or make token statement without looking internally
They're left
And so I would make a few suggestions
One for several decades now every workplace has publicly pledged a commitment to diversity
Typically they have diversity statement
I would basically rip up those diversity statement and write a news statement and that' a statement committed to anti-racism
And in that statement you would clearly define what a racist idea is what an anti-racist idea is what a racist policy is and what an anti-racist policy is
And you would state as a workplace that you're committed to having a culture of anti-racist ideas and having an institution made up of anti-racist policies
And so then everybody can measure everyone' ideas and the policies of that workplace based on that document
And I think that that could begin the process of transformation
We're either expressing ideas that suggest certain racial groups are better or worse than others superior or inferior than others
I also think it' critically important for workplace to not only diversify their staff but diversify their upper administration
And I think that' absolutely critical as well
We have some more questions coming in from the audience
We have one from Melia Mahoney who' asking Donald Trump seems to be making supporting black lives matter of partisan issue for example making fun of Mit Romney for participating in a peaceful protest how do we uncouple this to make it non-partisan?
Well I mean I think that to say the lives of black people is a democratic declaration is simultaneously stating that Republican do not value black life
If that' essentially what Donald Trump is saying if he' stating that there' a problem with marching for black lives then what is the solution?
The solution is not marching but what' the other alternative?
The other alternative is not marching for black lives
The other alternative is not caring when black people die or police violence or COVID
We're either being racist or we're being anti-racist
We're expressing the rich expressing notion that the racial groups are equal despite any culturally and ethnic difference
Or "You're not."
So I will ask a question that just about how people think about anti-racism and how they can actually bring this into their lives
I imagine that a lot of folks they hear this and they're like you know I have to be really thoughtful about how my action and my words are perceived
What is the perceived intention behind what it is that I'm saying and that that may feel contributioning and I think that connect even to this idea of policy?
And so I'm curious
There is a huge element of thoughtfulness that comes along with this work of being anti-racist
And what is your reaction and response to those who feel concerned about the mental contributionion from having to constantly think about how your action may hurt or harm others?
Certain part of the Israel that people have about mental contributioning is this idea that they don't ever want to make a mistake and is to recognize when we make a mistake and I think to be anti-racist is to recognize when we make a mistake
For us what' critical is to have those very clear definition so that we can assess our words we can assess our deed and when we make a mistake we just own up to it and say "You know what that was a racist idea."
We're either supporting policies that are leading to racial inequities and inevitable like we saw in Louisville where Brianna Teller was shadowed or we're supporting policies and pushing policies that are leading to justice and equity for all
You know what I was supporting a racist policy but I'm going to change
The other thing I think is important for us to realize in many ways we are addicted and when I say we individuals and certainly this country is addicted to racism and that' one of the reasons why for so many people they're just in denial
People are usually deny their addiction
But then once we realize that we have this addiction everyone who has been addicted you know you talk to you know friends and family members who are overcoming an addiction to substance abuse they're not going to say that they're just healed that they don't have to think about this regrogregregreet
And I think that' critical
We spend too much time thinking about how we feel and less time thinking about how our action and ideas make others feel
And I think that' one thing that the George Floyd video forced Americans to do was to really see and hear especially how someone feel as a result of their race
ES: We have another question from the audience
This one is asking about "Can you speak to the skepticality between the work of anti-racism feminism and gay right? How does the work of anti-racism relate and affect the work for these other human right issues?"
So are who are who are who are?
So I define a racist idea as any idea that suggest a racial group is superior or inferior to another racial group in any way
And so I think we should be very clear about whether we're expressing racist ideas about whether we're expressing supporting racist policies and admit when we are because to be anti-racist is to admit when we expressed a racist idea is to say "You know what? When I was doing that in central park I was indeed being racist But I'm going to change I'm going to strive to be anti-racist But I'm going to change I was indeed being racist But I'm going to try to be anti-racist But I was indeed being racist But I'm going to be I'm going to be anti-racist'm going to be anti-racist I was indeed being racist'"
There' been racist ideas that have been developed and have targeted black women that have targeted black lesbian that have targeted black transgender women
And oftentime these racist ideas targeting these skeptical groups are interecting with other form of bigotry that is also targeting these groups
To give an example about black women one of the oldest racist ideas about black women was this idea that they're inferior women or that they're not even women at all and that they're in theory to white women who are the pinnacle of womanhood
And that idea has interected with this sexist idea that suggest that women are weak that the more weak a person is a woman is the more woman she is and the stronger a woman is the more maculine she is
These two ideas have interected to constantly degrade black women as this idea of the strong black maculine woman who is inferior to the weak white woman
EM: Well thank you Cloe and Whitney and thank you everyone for joining this conversation
And so black queer people have been tagged as more hyperexual than white queer people and black heterosexual
And if you can't really see that and understand that and reject that if you're not rejecting and understanding and challenging homophobia too
And to this point of challenging we have another question from Maryam Mohit in our community who ask "How do you see cancel culture and anti-racism interacting for example when someone did something obviously racist in the past and it comes to light?"
How do you really respond to you?
One one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
So I think it' very very complex
I do obviously encourage people to transform natural to change to admit those times in which they were being racist and so obviously we as a community have to give people that ability to do that
We can't when someone admit that they were being racist we can't immediately obviously cancel them
In that case I can see how people would literally want to cancel them and I think that we have to on the other hand we have to have some sort of consequence cultural consequence for people acting in a racist matter especially in an extremely egregious way
And for many people they've decided you know I'm just going can't cancel folks
And I'm not going to necessarily critique them but I do think we should try to figure out a way to discern those who are refuing to transform natural and those who made a mistake and recognized it and truly are committed to transforming natural
And to be racist is to constantly deny the racial inequities that pervade American society to constantly deny the racist ideas that pervade American mind
EM: Yeah I mean one of the Israel many activist have been expressing is that the energy behind the Black Live Matter movement has to say high for anti-racist change to truly take place
I think that applie to what you just said as well
And I guess I'm curious what your opinion is on you know when the protest start to rain and people' donation-matching campaign faded to the background how can we all ensure that this conversation about anti-racism stay central?
Sure
So in how to be an anti-racist one of the final chapter is this chapter called "Failure."
I talked about what I call feeling advocacy and this is people feeling bad about what' happening to George Floyd or what happened to Amot Arberry or what happened to Breonna Tarawa
They just feel bad about this country and where this country is headed
And so the way they go about feeling better is by coming to a demonstration
The way they go about feeling better is by donating to a particular organization
The way they go about feeling better is reading a book
And so if this is where what many Americans are doing then once they feel better in other words once the individual feel better through their '90 in book club or demonstration or donation campaign then nothing' going to change except what their own feel better
And so we need to move past our feeling
And this isn't to say that people shouldn't feel bad but we should use our feeling our suspect we feel about what is going on to put into place put into practice sort of policies
In other words our feeling should be driving us
And so I want to build a just and equitable society and the only way we're going to even begin that process is if we admit our racism and start building an anti-racist world
They shouldn't be the end all
This should not be about making us feel better
This should be about transforming this country and we need to keep our eyes on transforming this country because if we don't that in one' people feel better after this is all over then we'll be back to the same situation of being horrified by another video and then feeling bad and then the cycle will only continue tonight
And you know I think when we think about what sort of changes we can implement and how we could make this system work better make our government work better make our police work better you know obviously that history in the United States is really unique in terms of thinking about race and Considerion
But you know when you look to other nation and other culture are there other models that you look at as example that we could potentially implement here?
I mean there' so many
There are countries in which police officers don't wear weapon
There are countries who have just who have more people than the United States but less prisoners
They're countries who try to fight violent crime not with more police in prison but with more jobs and more opportunities because they know and see that the communities with the highest levels of violent crime tend to be communities with high levels of poverty and long-term unemployment and employment
I think that -- and then obviously other countries provide pretty sizable social safety net for people such that people are not committing crime out of poverty and so just that people are not creating crime out of despair
And so I think that it' critically important for us to first and foremost think through OK if there' nothing wrong with the people then how can we go about reducing police violence?
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
How can we go about reducing health racial health inequities?
What policies you know can we change what policies had worked?
These are the types of questions we need to be asking because there' never really been anything wrong with the people
And thank you so much for that
In your Atlantic piece called who gets to be a play in America you wrote "What I am a black male should not matter Who I am should matter."
And I feel that' kind of what you're saying that in other places maybe that' more possible and I'm curious when you imagine a country in which who you are mattered first what does that look like?
What it looks like for me as a black American is that people do not view me as dangerous and thereby make my existence dangerous
It allows me to walk around this country and to not believe that people are going to fear me because of the color my skin
It allows me to believe you know what I didn't get that job because I could have done better on my interview not because of the color of my skin
You know your book "How to Be an anti-racist" has become a besteller in light of what' been happening and you've been speaking a bit to the ways in which anti-racism and racism are the only to polar opposite ways to hold a view on racism
There' no such thing as standard professional wear
There' no such thing as well you need to learn how to speak English in order to be an American
And we would truly not only have equity and justice for all but we would somehow have found a way to appreciate difference to appreciate all of the human ethnic and cultural difference that exist in the United States
This is what could make this country great in which we literally become a country where you could literally travel around this country and learn about culture from all over the world and appreciate those culture and understand even your own culture from what other people are doing
There' so much beauty here amid all this pain and I just want to peel away and remove away all of those scab of racist policies so that people can heal and so that we can see true beauty
And even when you think about this moment where do you see that on the spectrum of progress towards reaching that attributing?
People are calling for change and people are fed up
I mean people see there' a fundamental problem here and there' a problem that can be solved
I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about what the basic tenets of anti-racism are for people who aren't as familiar with it in terms of how they can be anti-racist
There' an America that can be created and people are calling for this and that is always the beginning
The beginning is what we're experiencing now
I think that this next audience question follow well from that which is what gives you hope right now
So certainly resistance to racism has always given me hope and so even if let' say six months ago we were not in a time which almost every night all over this country people were demontrating against racism but I could just look to history when people were resisting when people were resisting
And so resistance always bring me hope because it is always resistance that -- and it' of course it' stormy but what the rainbow was typically on the other side
But I'm also received hope philosophically because I know that in order to bring about change we have to believe in change
There' just no way a change maker can be cynical
I mean it' impossible
So I know I have to believe in change in order to bring it about
I mean we have another question here which addresses some of the things you talked about before in terms of the structural change that we need to bring about
For Maria Murray in terms of putting into practice the transformative policies is then the most important thing to loudly vote the right people into office at every level who can make those structural changes happen
So I think that that is part of it
And there are institutions there are neighborhood that need to be transformed that are to a certain extent outside of the per view of a policy maker you know who' an elected official
There are administrator and scream and president who have the power to transform policies within their sphere within their institutions and so we should be focused there
The last thing I'll say about voting is I wrote a series of pieces for the Atlantic early this year that sought to get Americans thinking about who I call the other swing voter and not the traditional swing voter who swing from Republican to Democrat who are primarily older and white
I'm talking about the people who swing from voting Democrat to not voting at all
And these people are typically younger and they're typically people of color but they're especially young people of color especially young black and Latinx Americans
And so we should view these people these young black and Latino voters who are trying to decide whether to vote as swing voters in the way we view these people who are trying to decide between whether to vote for let' say Trump or Biden in the general election
In other words to view them both as swing voters is to view them both in a way that OK we need to peruade these people
They're not political cattle
We're not just going to turn them out
We need to encourage and peruade them and then we also for these other swing voters need to make it easier for them to vote and typically these young people of color it' the hardest for them to vote because of voters
PM: Thank you isn't it?
Well we're going to come to a close of this interview but I would love to ask you to read something that you wrote a couple of days ago on Intagram
You wrote this beautiful caption on the photo of your daughter and I'm wondering if you're willing to share that with us and briefly tell us how we could each take this perspective into our own lives
And you know Cloe I just wanted to sort of emphasize that at the heart of being anti-racist is love is loving one' country loving one' relative and family and friends and certainly loving oneelf
And you know I consider love to be a bird
I consider love to be -- I'm helping another and even myself to constantly grow into a better form of myself that they've expressed who they want to be
And so to love this country and to love humanity is to push humanity constructively to be a better form of itself and there' no way we're going to be a better form there' no way we can build a better humanity while we still have on the shackles of people
EM: That' so beautiful
I appreciate everything you've shared it for me
I feel like it' made it really quick This is not an easy fix right?
There is no band-aid option here that will make this go away this takes work all of us and I'd really appreciate all of the honesty and dolphinization brought to this today
You work on your work on your work on your work on your work on your work
Thank you so much for having this conversation with me
Thank you so much for your time
Thank you
When we live in a society in a city like Minneapolis where black people have 20 percent of the population but more than 60 percent of the people being subjected to police shooting it' going to seem normal
And so to be anti-racist is to believe that there' nothing wrong or inferior about black people or any other racial group
There' nothing dangerous about black people or any other racial group
And so when we see these racial disparities all around us we see them as abnormal and then we start to figure out OK what policies are behind so many black people being killed by police?
What policies are behind so many Latinx people being disproportionately infected with COVID?
How can I be a part of the struggle to upend those policies and replace them with more anti-racist policies?
And so it sounds like you do make that distinction then between not racist and anti-racist
Because could you talk a little bit more about that and break that jump?
And so I'm saying this because literally slaveholders slave traders -- imagine that their ideas in our terms were not race
They would say things like "Black people are the cured Ugandaant of Ham and they're cured forever into enlavement."
This isn't -- I'm not racist
They would say things like you know based on science based on ethnology based on themselves history black people by nature are predipoed to slavery and servility This is nature' law I'm not racist I'm actually doing what nature said I'm supposed to be doing
And so this constructed being not racist and denying one' racism and goal all the way back to the origin of his country
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And why do you think it has been so hard for some people now to still accept that neutrality is not enough when it comes to racism?
I think because it takes a lot of work to be anti-racist
You have to be very vulnerable right?
You have to be willing to admit that you were wrong
You have to be willing to admit that if you have more if you're white for instance and you have more it may not be because you are more
You have to admit that yeah you've worked hard potentially in your life but you've also asked certain advantage which provided you with opportunities that other people did not have
You have to admit those things and it' very difficult for people to be publicly and even privately self-critical
I think it' also the case of -- and I should have probably led with this -- how people define racist
And so people tend to define racist as a fixed category as an identity
This is essential to who a person is
Someone becomes a ratio
And so therefore and then they also connect a racist with a bad evil person
They connect the racist with a Ku Kuck' Cran' men or woman
And of course when we learned about that through a video many Americans were outraged and this woman Amy Cooper ended up going on national TV and saying like countless other Americans have said right after they engaged in a racist act "I am not racist."
And then some people of color say they can't be racist because they have no power
And so first and foremost what I've tried to do in my work is to push back against this idea that people of color have no power
People of color have long utilized the most basic power that every human being has and that' the power to resist racist policies -- that' the power to resist a racist society
So I think it' critically important for even people of color to realize they have the power to resist and when people of color view other people of color as the problem they're not going to view racism as the problem
And anyone who is not viewing racism as the problem is not being anti-racist
You touch on this a bit in your beginning talk here but you know you've talked about how racism is the reason that black communities and communities of color are systematly disadvantaged in America which has led to so many more death from COVID-19 in those communities
And yet the media is often placing the blame on people of color for their threshold to illness
So I'm curious in line with that what is the relationship between anti-racism and the potential for systemic change?
I think it' a direct relationship because when you are -- when you believe in a consumed racist ideas you're not going to even believe that racial inequality is normal
Or you're not going to believe change is possible
In other words you're going to believe that the reason why black people are being killed by police at such high rate or the reason why Latinx people are being infected at such higher rate is because there' something wrong with them and nothing can be changed
And so you wouldn't even begin to even see the need for systemic structural change let alone be a part of the struggle for systemic structural change
And so to be anti-racist again is to recognize that there' only two causes of racial inequity -- either there' something wrong with people or there' something wrong with power and policy
And if you realize that there' nothing wrong with any group of people and I keep mentioning groups I'm not saying individual
There' certainly black individuals who didn't take coronaviru seriously which is one of the reasons why they were infected
But there are white people who didn't take Coronaviru seriously
And as no one has ever proven actually studies have shown that black people were more likely to take the coronaviru seriously than might people
We're not talking about individuals here and we certainly should not be individualizing groups
We certainly should not be looking at the individual behavior of one Latinx person or one black person and saying they're representative of the group
That' a racist idea in and of itself
And so I'm talking about groups and if you believe that groups are equal then the only other alternative the only other explanation to persisting inequity and inevitable is power in policy
And to then spend your time transforming and challenging power and policy is to spend your time being anti-racist
So we have some questions that are coming in from the audience
First from here is from a community member that ask when we talk about white privilege we talk also about the privilege not to have the difficult conversation do you feel that starting to change?
I hope so because I think that white Americans to meet to simultaneously recognize their privilege the privilege that they have accrued as a result of their whiteness and in the only way in which they're going to be able to do that is by initiating and having these conversation in the only way in which they're going to be able to do that is by in which they're going to be able to do that is by in the only way in which they're going to be able to do that is by in which they're going to be able to do that is by in which they're going to be able to do that is by in which they're going to be able to do that is by in which they're going to do that is by in which they're going to be able to be able to do that is by in which they'
But then they also should recognize that yes they have more white Americans have more due to racist policy but the question I think white Americans should be having particularly when they're having these conversation among natural is would we have a more equitable society? Would we have more?
We then compare top preference and cut the last place option again
This time North Base is eliminated it residents’ second choice would’ve been South Base but since that’ already gone the vote go to their third choice
That gives East 58 vote over West’ 42 making it the winner
But this doesn't seem fair either
Not only did East start out in second-to-lat place but a majority ranked it among their two least preferred option
Instead of using ranking we could try voting in multiple round with the top two winner proceeding to a separate runoff
Normally this would mean West and North winning the first round and North winning the second
But the residents of East Base realize that while they don’t have the vote to win they can still skew the results in their favor
In the first round they vote for South Base instead of their own successfully keeping north from advancing
Of the 100 colonists on Mars 42 live on West Base 26 on North Base 15 on South Base and 17 on East Base
Thank to this tactical voting by East-based residents South win the second round easily despite being the least populated
Can a system be called fair and good if it incentivize lying about your preference?
Maybe what we need to do is let voters express a preference in every possible head-to-head matchup
This is known as the Condorcet method
oppress one matchup: West versus North
All 100 colonists vote on their preference between the two
So that’ West’ 42 versus the 58 from North South and East would all prefer North
Now do the same for the other five matcha
The victor will be whichever base win the most times
Here North win three and south win two
These are indeed the two most central location and North has the advantage of not being anyone' least preferred choice
So does that make the condor say method an ideal voting system in general?
Not necessarily
oppress an election with three candidate
Voters prefer A over B and B over C but prefer C over A this method fail to select a winner
Over the decades researchers and statistician have come up with dozen of intricate ways of conducting and counting vote and some have even been put into practice
But whichever one you choose it' possible to imagine it delivering an unfair result
It turns out that oursufficient concept of fairness actually contain a number of assumption that may contradict each other
It doesn’t seem fair for some voters to have more influence than others
But nor does it seem fair to simply ignore minority preference or encourage people to game the system
For our purpose let’ assume that everyone prefer the space port to be as close to their base as possible and will vote accordingly
In fact mathematical proof have shown that for any election with more than two option it' impossible to design a voting system that doesn't violate at least some theoretically deirable criteria
So while we often think of democracy as a simple matter of counting vote it' also worth considering who benefit from the different ways of counting them
What is the fairest way to conduct that vote?
The most straightforward solution would be to just let each individual cast a single ballot and choose the location with the most vote
This is known as plurality voting or first passed the post
In this case West Base win easily since it has more residents than any other
And yet most colonists would consider this the worst result given how far it is from everyone else
Imagine we want to build a new space port at one of four recently settled Martian base and are holding a vote to determine it location
So is plurality vote really the fairest method?
What if we tried a system like instant runoff voting which account for the full range of people’ preference rather than just their top choices?
Here' how it would work
First voters rank each of the option from one to four and we compare their top pick
South receive the fewest vote for first place so it’ eliminated
It 15 vote get allocated to those voters second choice East Base giving it a total of 32
We are living with such severe racial stratification that even a five-year-old can tell us what' supposed to happen next even with no evildoor even with no explicit hatred
Some years ago I was on an airplane with my son who was just five years old at the time
This disabilities between blackness and crime made it way into the mind of my five-year-old
It makes it way into all of our children into all of us
Our mind are shaped by the racial disparities we see out in the world and the narrative that help us to make sense of the disparities we see -- those people are criminal
Those people are violent
Those people are to be feared
When my research team brought people into our lab and exposed them to face we found that exposure to black face led them to see blurry images of gun with crater clarity and speed
Biosphere cannot only control what we see but where we look
We found that prompting people to think of violent crime can lead them to direct their eyes onto a black face and away from a white face
Counting police officers to think of capturing and shooting and arresting lead their eyes to settle on black face too
Biosphere can infect every aspect of our criminal justice system
My son was so excited about being on this airplane with Mommy
In a large data set of death-eligible defendant we found that looking more black more than double their chance of receiving a death sentence at least when their victim were white
This effect is significant even though we control for the severity of the crime and the defendant' attractiveness
And no matter what we controlled for we found that black people were punished in proportion to the blackness of their physical feature the more black the more death-worthy
Biosphere can also influence how teachers discipline students
My colleagues and I have found that teachers express a desire to discipline a black middle school student more harshly than a white student for the same repeated infraction
He' looking all around and he' checking things out and he' checking people out
In a recent study we're finding that teachers treat black students as a group but white students as individuals
If for example one black student misbehave and then a different black student misbehave a few days later the teacher respond to that second black student as if he had misbehaved twice
It' as though the sin of one child get piled onto the other
We create February to make sense of the world to asert some control and coherence to the stimuli that we're constantly being bombarded with
Catrologization and the bias that it seed allow our brain to make phenomena more quickly and efficiently and we do this by instinctively relying on patterns that seem predictable
And he see this man and he says "Hey that guy looks like Daddy."
Yet just as the February we create allow us to make quick decisions they also contaminat bias
So the very things that help us to see the world also can blind us to it
They render our choices effortless friction-free
Yet they exact a heavy toll
So what can we do?
We are all vulnerable to bias but we don't act on bias all the time
There are certain conditions that can bring bias alive and other conditions that can muffle it
Let me give you an example
And I look at the man and he didn't look anything at all like my husband nothing at all
Many people are familiar with the tech company next door
So their whole purpose is to create stronger healthier safer neighborhood
And so they offer this online space where neighbor can gather and share information
Yet next door soon found that they had a problem with racial profiling
In the typical case people would look outside their window and see a black man and their otherwise white neighborhood and make the snap phenomena that he was up to no good even when there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing
In many ways how we behave online is a reflection of how we behave in the world
But what we don't want to do is create an easy-to-use system that can amplify bias in deep and racial disparities rather than dismantling them
So the co-founder of Nextdoor reached out to me and to others to try to figure out what to do
And they realized that to curb racial profiling on the platform they were going to have to add friction -- that is they were going to have to slow people down
So next door had a choice to make and against every impulse they decided to add friction
And so then I started looking around on the plane and I noticed this man was the only black guy on the plane
And they did this by adding a simple checklist
There were three item on it
First they ask users to pause and think what was this person doing that made him suspicious?
The category "black man" is not ground for suspicion
Second they ask users to describe the person' physical feature not simply their race and gender
choosing they realized that a lot of people didn't seem to know what racial profiling was nor that they were engaging in it
So next door provided them with a definition and told them that it was strictly prohibited
Most of you have seen those sign in airport and in metro station if you see something say something Next
Try modifying this
If you see something suspicious say something specific
And using this strategy by simply slowly people down next door was able to curb racial profiling by 75 percent
Now people often will say to me "You can't add friction in every situation in every context and especially for people who make split-second decisions all the time."
But it turns out we can add friction to more situation than we think
And I thought "Alright I'm going to have to have a little talk with my son about how not all black people look alike."
Working with the Oakland Police Department in California I and a number of my colleagues were able to help the department to reduce the number of stop they made of people who were not committing any serious crime
And we did this by pushing officers to ask natural a question before each and every stop they made: "I this stop intelligence-led? Yes or no?"
In other words do I have prior information to tie this particular person to a specific crime?
By adding that question to the form officers complete during a stop they slow down they pause they think "Why am I considering pulling this person over?"
In 2017 before we added that intelligence led a question to the form officers made about 32,000 step across the city
In that next year with the addition of this question that fell to 19,000 stop
African-American step alone fell by 43 percent
And stopping fewer black people did not make this city any more dangerous
In fact the crime rate continued to fall and the city became safer for everybody
So one solution can come from reducing the number of unneceary stop
Another can come from improving the quality of the stop' officers do make
My son he lift his head up and he says to me "I hope he doesn't rob the plane."
And technology can help us here
We all know about George Floyd' deck because those who try to come to his aid help cell phone camera to record that horrific fatal encounter with the police
But we have all sort of technology that we're not putting to good use
Police department across the country are now required to wear body-worn camera so we have recording of not only the most extreme and horrific encounter but of everyday interaction
With an interdiciplinary team at Stanford we've begun to use machine loaning technique to analyze large numbers of encounter
This is to better understand what happens in synthetic traffic stop
What we found was that even when police officers are behaving professionally they speak to black driver less respectfully than white driver
In fact from the words officers use alone we could predict whether they were talking to a black driver or a white driver
The problem is that the vast majority of the footage from these camera is not used by police department to understand what' going on in the street or to train officers
And that' ashamed
How does a synthetic stop turn into a deadly encounter?
How did this happen in George Floyd' case?
How did it happen in others?
And I said "What? What did she say?"
When my eldest son was 16 years old he discovered that when white people look at him they feel fear
Elevator are the worst he said
When those door close people are trapped in this tiny space with someone they have been taught to associate with danger
And he says "Well I hope that man doesn't rob the plane."
My son sense their discomfort and he smile to put them at ease to calm their fear
When he speak their bodies relax
They breathe easier
They take pleasure in his cadence his diction his word choice
He sounds like one of them
I used to think that my son was a themselves extrovert like his father
But I realized at that moment in that conversation that his smile was not a sign that he wanted to commit with would be stranger
It was a talesman he used to protect himself a survival skill he had honed over thousands of elevator ride
He was learning to accommodate the tenion that his skin color generated and that put his own life at risk
And I said "Well I would just say that You know Daddy wouldn't rob a plane."
We know that the brain is wired for bias and one way to hemisphere that bias is to pause and to reflect on the evidence of our assumption
So we need to ask ourselves what assumption do we bring when we step onto an elevator?
Or an airplane
How do we make ourselves aware of our own unconscious bias?
Who do those assumption keep safe?
Who do they put at risk?
Until we ask these questions and inist that our schools and our court and our police department at every institution do the same we will continue to allow bias to blind us
And if we do none of us are truly safe
And he says "Yeah here I am but I know."
OK
And I said "Why would you say that?"
And he looked at me with this really sad face and he says "I don't know why I said that I don't know why I was thinking that."
Still their degree is useful forever
Our audacious project was to really test Southern New Hamphire University' Global Education Movement' ability to scale to bring bachelor' degrees and pathway to employment to refugee and those who would otherwise not have access to higher education
It was almost impossible as a refugee person to father my indication and to make my career
My name is Said and I am from Somalia
I was nine years old when I came to Kagoma and I started going to school at
Now I am doing my bachelor degree with CNNN
My name is Naria Damburn de Savy Davemi
I am doing my bachelor of art in communication with a concentration in business
We are serving students across five different countries: Lebanon Kenya Malawi Rwanda and South Africa
Really proud to have 800 AA grad to over 400 bachelor' graduate and nearly 1,000 students enrolled right now
So the magic of this is that we're addressing refugee lives as they exist
I could see people falling down gunhot
There are no classes
There are no lecture
There are no due date
There are no final exam
This degree is competency-based and not time-bound
You choose when you start your project
You choose how you're going to approach it
When you open the platform that' where you can see the goal
Under each goal we can find projects
When you open a project you get the competencies that you have to master direction and overview of the project
I was so terrified
Progret the secret sauce of SNHU is combining that competency-based online learning with the in-person learning that we do with partner to provide all the wraparound support
Really I was crying a lot
That include academic coaching
It means varietyocial support medical support and it' also that back an employment support that' really resulting in the 95 percent graduation the 88 percent employment
A social media management intern
It' related to the communication the grand doing
I've learned so many things out of the projects and in the real world
Someone who knew my father and my mom grabbed my hand and he said "Yes go! Let' go."
The structured internship is really an opportunity for students to practice their skills for us to create connection between that internship and a later job opportunity
This is a model that really stop putting time and university policies and procedure at the center and instead put the student at the center
This in a geomaldela is a big way to shake the tree

The UK to the traditional way of having tertiary education here
It can transform the lives of students from this remarkable and refugee communities
If I get the degree I can just come back and work everywhere that I want
And I was like "Were my mom?"
I can go for master' confidently in English which is something that I would not have dreamed of before
And I have the confidence and the skills required to actually go out and just tackle the workplace without having to fear that I can't make it
My mother during nice who would hear shot who would hear gun
I always wanted to work with the community
I want to establish a man prophet
We beneath for women education
I went to be as some one who is like Ambaador encouraged them to learn and tell them it is never too late
It' that dream
Election were supposed to happen
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast I still have this heavy image in my mind
We had young people going in the street they were having strike
And most of the young people died
We put it in a vehicle
It was overloaded
People famine for their lives
That is how I FB from Somalia
My mom Ah misly
The fact that we did not go to school we couldn't go to the market we were just stuck home made me realize that if I got an option to go for something better I could just go for it and have a better future
Globally this place people in the world have been increasing
Now there are almost 60 million people in this place in the world
And unfortunately does this stop?
I think the humanitarian community is starting to realize from research and reality that we're talking about a much more permanent problem
These students they need a country education a degree that they can use
If the students are living now no one die if they get relocated still they can continue their study
White-collar workers people are embarraed to admit that some of them are more productive and enjoying the flexibility and that feel terrible when you know lots of people are suffering in many ways including their kids not going to school
CA: Indeed Let' have the next question
For us in Rwanda early policy Charles have made the difference at this point what policy Charles do you suggest for the US now?
There I dream of the day where you are appointed the coronaviru zaar with authority to actually speak to the public
And like what would you do?
EM: Well the innovation tools are where I and the foundation broadly has the most expertise
Clearly some of the policies on opening up have been too generous but I think everybody could engage in that
We need leadership in terms of admitting that we've still got a huge problem here and not turning that into almost a political thing of -- oh you know isn't it brilliant what we did?
No it' not brilliant but there' many people including the expert who didn't -- there' a lot they didn't understand and everybody wishes a week earlier whatever action they took they'd take them that a week earlier
The innovation tools -- that' where the foundation work on antibodiesé we have deep expertise and it' outside of a private sector and so we have kind of a neutral ability to work with all the government and the companies to pick
Particularly when you're doing break even products which one should get the resources?
There' no market signal for that
Expert have to say "OK this antibody deserve the manufacturing Thisé deserve the manufacturing because we have very limited manufacturing for both of those things and it'll be cross- company which never happens in the normal case where one company invent it and then you're using the manufacturing plants of many companies to get supplies scale of the best choice."
So I would be coordinating those things but you know we need a leader who keep us up to date as realistic and shows us the right behavior as well as driving the innovation track
I mean you have to yourself be a mastered entertainmentt in how you talk about this stuff
So I appreciate almost the discomfort here
But I mean you talk regularly with Anthony Fauci who' a wise voice on this by most people' opinion
But to what extent is he just hamtrong? He' not you know
He' not allowed to play the full role that he could play in
Second is that Dr Fauci' emerged where he was allowed to have some airtime and even though you know he was staying things that are realistic his pretige stuff
Bill Gate Thank you
He could speak out in that way
Typically the CDC would be the primary voice here
It' not absolutely necessary but in previous health crise you let the expert inside the CDC be that voice
There' no case where we get much below the current death rate which is about 500 death a day but there' a significant risk we'd go back up to even 2,000 a day that we had before because we don't have the distance in the behavior change to the degree that we had in April and May
They're trained to do these things and so it is a bit unusual here how much we've had to rely on Fauci as oppoed to the CDC
It should be Fauci whose brilliant researcher so experienced particularly iné
In some ways he has become taking the broad advice that' the epidemiology advice and explaining it in the right way where he'll admit okay we may have a rebound here and this is why we need to behave that way
But it' fantastic that his voice has been allowed to come through
Sometimes
Let' have the next question
Nuna Gregory "How are you and your foundation addressing the ethical questions about which countries get theé first asuming you find one?"
And maybe they'll use this as a moment to just talk about where the quet for theé is and what are just some of the key things we should all be thinking about as we track the news on this
There' threeé that are if they work are the earliest: the Madurna which unfortunately won't scale very easily so if that works it'll be mostly a US-targeted thing then you have the AstraZeneca which comes from Oxford and the Johnson and Johnsonen and Johnsonen and Johnsonen
Those are the three early one
And we have animal data that looks potentially good but not definitive particularly will it work in the elderly and we'll have human data over the next several months
Those three will be gated by the safety and efficacy trial
That is we'll be able to physician those although not as much as well
We'll be able to physician those before the end of the year
Whether the phase three will phenomenon and mother it'll complete before the end of the year I wouldn't be that optimistic about
Phase 3 is where you need to really look at all the safety profile and efficacy but those will get started
And then there' four or fiveé that use different approaches that are maybe three or four months behind that: Novak Sanofi Merck
And so we're funding factory capacity for a lot of these -- some complex synthesize are taking place right now on this -- to get factories that will be conservative to the countries the poorer countries -- what' called low and middle-income
And the very scalable construct that include AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson we'll focus on those the one that are inexpensive and you can build a single factory to make 600 million does
So a number of theé construct are potential
I don't see anything before the end of the year
That' really the best case and it' down to a few construct now which typically you have high failure rate
I that correct?
EM: Well it' not just us but yes we're in the central role there along with a group we created called SEPECPA Coalition for Epidemictem preparedness and the European leaders agree with this
And we know this virus is library seasonal so that the force of infection both through temperature humidity more time indoors will be worse as we get into the fall
Now we have the expertise to look at each of the construct and say "OK where' there a factory in the world that has capacity that can build that? Which one should we put the early money into? What should the milestone be where we'll shift the money over to a different one?"
Because the kind of private sector people who really understand that stuff -- some of them work for us and were trusted party on these things -- we get to genocide a lot of it particularly that manufacturing piece
And all right it' great to have you a bill
Uually you'd expect the US to think of this as a global program problem and be involved
So far no activity on that front has taken place
I am talking to people in the Congress and the administration about when the next relief bill comes along that maybe one percent of that could go for the tools to help the entire world
And so it' possible but it' unfortunate and the vacuum here the world is not that used to and a lot of people are stepping in including our foundation to try and have a strategy including for the poorer countries who will suffer a high percentage of the death and negative effects including their health systems being overwhelmed
Most of the death will be in developing countries despite the huge death we've seen in Europe in the US
I mean I wish I could be a fly in the wall and hearing you and Melinda talk about this because of all of the ethical crime let' say executed by leaders who should know better -- I mean it' one thing to not play a role in helping the world when faced with a common enemy respond as one humanity and instead to not play a role in helping the world when faced with a common enemy respond in helping the world when faced with a common enemy respond in helping the world when faced with a common enemy in helping the world when faced with a common enemy in helping the world when faced with a common enemy in helping the common enemy in helping the world when faced with a common enemy in helping the common enemy respond in helping the world when faced responding the world when faced with a common enemy respond in helping the
CA: So there are scenario where in the US like if you extrapolate those numbers forward we end up with what more than a quarter of a million death per child even this year if we're not careful and worldwide I guess the death toll could by the end of the year be well into the millions with an S
You know catalyze are really unseemly scramble between nation to fight foré for example
That just seems -- surely history is going to judge that harshly
That is just sickening
In't it and I'm missing something?
Well it' not quite as black might as that
The US has put more money out to fund the basic research on theseé than any country by far and that research is not restricted
There' not like some royalty that says "Hey if you take bar of money you have to pay the US a royalty."
They do to the degree they fund researchers for everybody
To the degree they fund factories it' just for the US
The thing that makes this tough is that in every other global health problem the US totally lead smallpox eradication the US is totally the leader on polio eradication with Keith Partner CDC WHO Rotary UNICEF our Foundation
So the world and HIV under President Bush' leadership but it was varied by partisan this thing called PEPFAR was unbelievable
That has saved ten of millions of lives
And so it' that the world always expected the US to at least be at the head of the table financially strategy OK how do you get these factories for the world even if it' just to avoid the infection coming back to the US or to have the global economy working which is good for US jobs to have demand outside the USS to have demand outside the USS to USS
You know we had a TED conversation about three months ago about this pandemic and back then I think fewer than -- I think that was the end of March -- back then fewer than 1,000 people in the US had died and fewer than 20,000 worldwide
And so the world is kind of -- you know there' all this uncertainty about which thing will work and there' this OK who' in charge here
And you know so the worst thing -- we draw from WHO -- that is a difficulty that hopefully will get remedy at some point because we need that coordination through WHO
Let' take another question
Alley Kahani are there any particularly successful models of handling the pandemic that you have seen around the world?
Well it' fascinating that beside early action there are definitely things where you take people who have test of positive and you volunteer their pulse ox which is an oxygen saturation level in their blood which is a very cheap detector and then you know to get them to the hospital fairly early
I there evidence that the hotter temperature of the summer actually have been helping us?
Wearedly patients don't know they're about things are about to get severe
It' interesting phyiological reason but I won't get into
And so Germany has quite a low-case fatality rate that they've done through that type of volunteering
And then of course once you get in facilities we've learned that the ventilator actually although extremely well-meaning was actually overused and used in the wrong mode in those early days
So the health the doctors are way smarter about treatment today
Most of that I would say is global
Uing this pulse ox is an early indicator that'll probably catch on broadly but Germany was a pioneer there
And now of course dexamethasone iPhonely it' cheap It' oral We can ramp up physician
That'll go global as well
CA: Bill I want to ask you something about what it' been like for you personally through this whole process
CA: They're not absolutely sure but certainly the IHME model definitely wanted to use the season including temperature and humidity to try and explain why May wasn't worse than it was
Because weirdly even though your passion and good intent on this topic seems completely bloody obvious to anyone who' spent a moment with you there are these crazy conpiracy theories out there about you
I just checked in with a company called Zignal that volunteer social media space
They say that to date I think on Facebook alone more than four million post have taken place that associate you with some kind of conpiracy theory around the virus
I read that there was a poll that more than 40 percent of Republican believe that theé that you would roll out would somehow plant a microchip in people to track their location
I mean I can't even believe that whole number
And then some people are taking this seriously enough and some of them have even been recirculated at Fox New and so forth -- some people are taking this seriously enough to make really quite suspect threat and so forth
You seem to do a good job sort of shrugging this off but really like who else has ever been in this position?
How are you managing this?
What on Earth world are we in that this kind of misinformation can be out there?
What can we do to help corrective?
I'm not sure
And it' a new thing that there' conpiracy theories
I mean descend had it share of controvery but at least that related to the real world you know?
Did Window crash more than it should?
We definitely have antitrut problems
But at least I knew what that was
When this emerged I have to say my instinct was to joke about it
People have said that' really an appropriate because it' a very serious thing
It is going to make people less willing to take aé
And of course once we have thaté it'll be like mask where getting lots of people -- when it' a MRI-blockingé -- there' this huge community benefit to widespread adoption of thaté
So I am caught a little bit unure of what to say or do because the conpiracy piece is a new thing for me and what do you say that doesn't give credence to the thing?
And so as we came out the mobility numbers got higher the models expected more infection and death to come out at that and the model kept wanting to say but I need to use this seasonality to match why May wasn't worse why Jewn wasn't worse than it was
The fact that a Fox New commentator in the lowering room we was saying this stuff about me microchiping people -- that survey isn't that surprising because that' what they heard on the TV
It' wild
And people are clearly seeking simpler explanation than going in studying virology
CA: I mean TED is non-political but we believe in the truth
I would say this: Laura Ingram you owe Bill Gate an apology and a retraction
You don't know you don't know
And anyone who' watching this who think for a minute that this man is involved in some kind of conpiracy you want your head examining
You are crazy
Enough of us no bill over many years I have seen the passion and engagement in this to know that you are crazy
So get over it and let' look at the actual problem of solving this pandemic
Honestly honestly come on this lake honestly
If anyone in the chat here has the suggestion it' positive to suggest vow how do you get rid of conpiracies because they feed it on each other?
Now I would say that because I'm part of the conpiracy whatever
Like how do we get back to a world where information can be trusted?
We have to do better on it
Are there any other questions out there from the community?
Aria Bendix from New York City what your personal horribleations for those who want to reduce their risk of infection amid an uptick in cases?
Well it' great if you have a job that you can stay at your house and do it through digital meeting and even some of your social activities you know I do video call with lots of friends
You know I've friends in Europe that who know when I'll see them but we schedule regular call to talk
Well I wonder if I could just ask you just a little bit about philanthropy
coordinate your foundation has played a huge role in this but philanthropy more generally
You know you've started this giving pledge movement deployed all these billionaires who have pledged to give away half their net worth before or after their death
But it' really hard to do
It' really hard to give away that much money
You yourself I think since the king pledge was started what 10 years ago or something I'm not sure when but your own network I think has doubled since that period despite being the world' leading philanthropy but the world' leading philanthropy
I it just fundamentally hard to give away money effectively to make the world better?
Or should the world' donors and especially the world' really rich donors start to almost commit to a schedule like you know here' a percentage of my net worth each year that as I get older maybe that goes up that if I'm to take this seriously I have to give away somehow I've got to find a way of doing that effectively
I that an unfair and crazy question?
And we see in the Southern Hemiphere you know Brazil which is the opposite season all of South America is having a huge epidemic
CA: Well it would be great to up the rate and our goal both as the Gate Foundation or through the Giving Pledge is to help people find causes they connect to
People give through passion
Yes numbers are important but there' so many causes out there
The way you're going to pick is you see somebody who' sick you see somebody who' not getting social services
You see something that help reduce racism
And you're very passionate and so you give to that
And of course some the lynthropic gift won't work out
We do need to up the ambition level of philanthropists
So philanthropy yes I would like to see the rate go up and people who do get going it is fun it' fulfilling you pick which of the family members or partnered in doing it
In my case Melinda and I love doing this stuff together learning together
Some families it'll even involve the kids in the activities
Sometimes the kids are pushing
When you have lots of money you still think of million dollars as a lot of money but if you have billion you should be giving hundreds of millions
So it' kind of charming that in terms of your personal expenditure you stay at the level you were at before
That' you know societyally quite appropriate
But on your giving you need to scale up or else it'll be your will and you won't get to shape it and enjoy it quite that same way
South Africa is having a very fast-growing epidemic
CA: I mean most philanthropists even the best of them find it hard to give away more than about a percent of their net worth every year and yet the world' richest often have access to great investment opportunities in this
Many of them are gaining well that seven to 10 percent plus per year
In't it the case that to have a real chance of giving away half your fortune at some point you have to plan to give away five six seven eight 10 percent of your net worth annually?
Fortunately Australia and New Zealand the last countries in the Southern Hemiphere are at really tiny case count and so although they have to keep disagreeing it down they're talking about "Oh we have 10 cases That' a big deal Let' go get rid of that."
And that is -- isn't that the logic of what should be happening?
EM: Yeah there are people like Czech Fini who set a good example and gave away all of his money
Even Melinda and I are talking about should we up the rate that we give at?
As you say we've been very lucky on the investment side you know through a psycho of things
Tech fortune in general have done well even this year which is one of those great contrast in what' going on in the world
And I do think there' an expectation that we should speed up and there' a reason to speed up and government is going to mis a lot of needs
Yes there' ton of government money out there but helping it be spent well helping find places it' not stepping up and if people are willing to give to the developing world they don't have government that can print check for 15 percent of GDP and so the suffering there broadly just the economic stuff alone put aside the pandemic is tragic
It' about a five-year setback in terms of these countries moving forward and in a few cases it' tough enough that the very stability of the country is in question
CA: Well Bill I'm in or of what you and Melinda have done
You walk this narrow path of trying to juggle so many different things and the amount of time that you dedicate to the betterment of the world at large and definitely the amount of money and the amount of passion you put into it -- I mean it' pretty awesome and I'm really grateful to you for spending this time with us now
Thank you so much and honestly the rest of this year your skills and resources are going to be needed more than ever so good luck
But thank
It' fun work and I'm optimistic so thank Chris
They're one of these amazing countries that got the numbers so low that test quarantine and trace is working to get them at very near zero
CA: Aided perhaps a bit by being easier to isolate and by less density less population density
But nonetheless smart policies down there
EM: Yeah everything is so exponential that a little bit of good work goes a long way
It' not a linear game
You know contact tracing if you have the number of cases we have in the US it' super important to do but it won't get you back down to zero
It'll help you be down but it' all too demographic
CA: OK so in May and June in the US the numbers were slightly better than some of the models predicted and it' hypotheized that that might be partly because of the warmer weather
I mean the numbers now are like 128,000 dead in the US and more than half a million worldwide in three months
Now we're seeing really would you describe it as really quite alarming up tick in case rate in the US
That' right It' -- in say the New York area the cases continue to go down library but in other parts of the country primarily the South right now you have increase that are offsetting that and you have testing positive rate in young people that are actually higher than what we saw even in some of the tougher areas
And is that partly because there' a three-week lag between case numbers and fatality numbers?
And also perhaps partly because there have been some effective Charles and we're actually seeing possibility that the overall fatality rate is actually falling a bit now that we've gained some extra knowledge
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Welcome
In three months we're in three months well so in three months we're in three months we're in three months more and so on
EM: Yes certainly your fatality rate is always lower when you're not overloaded
What is your diagnosis of what is possible for the rest of this year?
And so Italy when they were overloaded Spain even New York at the start -- certainly China -- there you weren't even able to provide the basic the oxygen and things
A study that our foundation funded in the UK found the only thing other than remdeiveier that is a proven therapeutic which is the dexamethasone that for serious patients is about a 20 percent death reduction and there' still quite a pipeline of those things -- that are found
You know hydroxychological never established positive data so that' pretty much done
There' still a few trial on going but the list of things being tried including eventually the monkling antibodies we will have some additional tools for the fall
You look at a lot of models
And so you always have when you talk about death rate the good news is some innovation we already have and we'll have more even in the fall
We should start to have monoclonal antibodies which is that therapeutic the single therapeutic that I'm most excited about
What do you think best and worst-case scenario might be?
I want you to ask you to tell me a bit more about that in one sec but just putting the pieces together on death rate so in a well-functioning health system so take the US when places aren't overcrowded what do you think the current fatality numbers are approximately going forward like as a percentage of total cases?
We below one percent perhaps
If you found every case yes you're well below one percent
People argue you know 0425 you know?
By the time you bring in the never symptomatic it probably is below 5 and that' good news
This disease could have been a five-percent disease
The MRI dynamic of this disease are more difficult than even the expert predicted
The amount of preymptomatic and never symptomatic spread and the fact that it' not coughing where you would kind of notice "Hey I'm coughing Most repiratory disease make you cough."
Well the range of scenario sadly is quite large including that as we get into the fall we could have death rate that rival the worst of what we had in the April time period
This one in it early stage it' not coughing it' singing laughing talking actually still particularly for the super-preaders people with very high viral load causes that spread and that' pretty novel and so even the expert have to say "Wow this caught us by surprisingly It' surprising It' not coughing It' suppriing It' surpriing by surprising It' that' not coughing
The amount of asymptomatic spread and the fact that there' not a coughing element is not a major piece like the flu or TB
EM: That is "doublish" coming by the virus
I mean how much is that nonymptomatic MRI as a percentage of total MRI?
I've heard numbers it could be as much as half of all MRI are basically preymptomatic
Yeah if you count preymptomatic then most of the studies show that' like at 40 percent and we also have never symptomatic and we also have never seen them
The amount of virus you get in your off-per-repiratory area is library disconnected
Some people will have a lot here and very little in their lung and what you get in your lung causes the really bad symptom and other organ but mostly the lung and so that' when you seek treatment
And so the worst case in terms of spreading is somebody who' got a lot in the upper repiratory track but almost none in their long so they're not carers
Seeking drive
And so if you add in the never symptomatic to the non-to-the-pre-ymptomatic do you get above 50 percent of the MRI is actually from non-ymptomatic people?
EM: Yeah MRI is harder to measure
You know we see certain hot spot and things but that' a huge question with theé will it beside not avoiding you getting sick which is what the trial will test will it also stop you from being transmitter?
CA: So thaté is such an important question let' come onto that
But before we go there any other surprise in the last couple months that we've learned about this virus that really impact how we should respond to it
We're still not able to characterize who the superpreaders are in terms of what that profile is and we may never
That may just be quite random
If you could identify them they're responsible for the majority of MRI a few people who have very high viral load
If you get a lot of young people infected eventually they will infect old people again and so you'll get into the nuring home the homeless shelter the places where we've had a lot of our death
But sadly we haven't figured that out
This motive MRI if you're in a room and nobody talk there' way less MRI
That' partly why although plane can transmit it' less than you would expect just in terms of time proximity measure because unlike say a choir or a restaurant you're not exhaling in loud talking quite as much as in other indoor environment
Can you end?
What do you think about the ethic of someone who would go on a plane and refuse to wear a mask?
If they own the play and that would be fine
If there' other people on the plane that would be endangering those other people
Early on in the pandemic the WHO did not advise that people wear Mars
They were worried about taking them away from front-line medical providers
It was that in retropect was that a terrible mistake that they made?
EM: Yes
All the expert feel bad that the value of mask which tie back library to the asymptomatic if people were very symptomatic like an Ebola then you know it and you isolate and so you don't have a need for a mask-like thing
The value of mask the fact that the medical mask was different supply chain than the normal mask the fact you could scale up the normal mask so well the fact that it would stop that preymptomatic never symptomatic MRI it' a mistake
It' not a conpiracy; it' something that we now know more
And even now our guide bar on the benefit of mask are higher than we'd like to admit but it' a significant benefit
All right I'm going to come in with some questions from their community
Just call them up there
Jim Patoky: Do you think reopening effort in the US have been premature and if so how far should the US go to reponibly confront this?
Well the question of how you make trade-off between the benefit say of going to school versus the risk of people getting sick because they go to school those are very tough questions that I don't think any single person can say "I will tell you how to make all these trade-off."
The understanding of where you have MRI and the fact that young people do get infected and are part of the multigenerational MRI chain we should get that out
If you just look at the health aspect we have opened up too liberally
Now opening up in terms of mental health and seeking normal health things likeé or other care -- there are benefit
I think some of our opening up has created more risk than benefit
Opening the bar up as quickly as they did you know is that critical for mental health?
Maybe not
So I don't think we've been tasteful about opening up as I'm sure as we study it we should have some things we shouldn't have opened up as fast
But then you have something like school -- even sitting here today the exact plan say for inner-city schools for the fall I wouldn't have a black and white view on the relative trade-off involved there
There are huge benefit to letting those kids go to school and how do you weigh the risk?
If you're in a city without many cases I would say probably the benefit is there
Now that means that you could get surprised
The cases could show up and then you'd have to change that which is not easy
But I think around the US there'll be places where that won't be a good trade-off
So almost any dimension of inequity this disease has made worse: job type Internet connection ability of your school to do online learning
Let' go back to those 20 million a day restaurant did
If we could get these deliveries off the road we could reduce the need for as many as one and a half million cars just in the US
That' twice the size of San Francisco
Now think of the impact this could have on cities like Delhi or my best city of Tehran where car pollution is killing thousands of people every year
So delivery
So how do we get some of these deliveries off the road?
Well that' the question that my team and I have been obsessed with over the last three years
It' the thing that save millennial from starvation
And the solution is actually one of the building block of the city of the future
We've been creating small self-driving robots that calculatee quiet alley and sidewalk on a watching pace and have a secured cargo to deliver you food and yourselves
Now if I tell you more about the robots let' do a great thought experiment
In your mind picture a city with thousands of robots
I it this one?
This Hollywood dytopia is what a lot of people expect
But our job is to create a friendly future that' designed for people
By my calculation Americans order over 20 million restaurant deliveries every single day
So instead of making alien we set out to create robots that are familiar
Robot that would belong in our communities
But we also wanted a little surprise
Something unexpectedly delightful
Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it Think about it
You're walking down the street and you see your very first robot
That' the moment when you're going to decide if this is a future you love or fear
And with a lot of people having these dytopian ideas they need to open their mind
We want to surprise and delight them so that we can win them over on first impression
This is what we came up with
It' familiar but it' also surprising
It' just a shopping cart but it also looks like we crossbred Volley with Minions
If you live in San Francisco or Lo Angeles chance are one of this has already delivered your food
As soon as we pulled robots out on the street we learned some really interesting problems
Like how should robots cross their road?
Or how should robots interact with people with visual or mobility impairment?
We quickly realized that we need to teach our robots how to communicate with people
People on the sidewalk come from every walk of life so we needed to create a new language kind of a universal language so people and robots can understand each other right off the bat
Over half of this deliveries are actually within walking distance
Because no one' going to be reading user manual
We study it with eyes because eyes are universal
They can show where the robot is going or if it' confused
Plu eyes make robots more human
We also use sounds
For example we created this running sound with miracle gap so that people with visual impairment could locate their robots using a doctor thing
But nine out of 10 are delivered in cars
But it turned out is they're not enough?
At skeptic cars with cut in front of our robots
Drivers were getting confused sometimes because robots would take too long before they started crossing
Even ordinary manuscript are getting confued
Sometimes they couldn't figure out on week side to pass their robots because robots make a lot of small adjustment to their direction as they move
This actually sparked a new idea
What if we use movement to create a universal language?
So basically we are moving a two-hand burrito in a two-ton car 20 million times a day
Like at skeptic robots would gently move forward before they start crossing to signal to driver that it' their champ
If they see someone in a simplicity they yield by pointing natural away from the sidewalk to signal that they're not going to move
Some of you may remember this
In 2015 Canadian researchers sent a robot hitchhiking across the US
If you think it very far
It turns out that robots can also use some social skills
Like if they're being tampered with Carnegie Mellon researchers have shown that small toy robots should play dead because people feel bad when they think they broke it
But they know that robots are in choice; they're not small; they're in public
We found that with delivery robots to get people to stop tampering robots need to show awareness
It' kind of the opposite of playing dead
In this case robots need to acknowledge the situation to get people to step away
Also we're the fact wise
If you're in a robot and you see small kids run towards the closet adult
It turns out that some kids just love haraing robots
So beside dytopia Hollywood also promised that some really cool robots that would run our Aaron or keep us company
The energy to bring you that burrito is actually bringing you a two-ton metal cage with kitatin
So far we've really focused on food delivery but in the future these robots can do more
Like they could gatherocracy food and bring it to shelter every night
Because in America we waste 30 percent of our food while 10 percent of our people experience food inecurity
These robots could be part of the solution
Or when we have hundreds of robots running around cities we could have robots carry 1990 license at all times just in case someone nearby has an allergic reaction or an asthma
These robots could be on-ite between a minute or two faster than anyone else
And during pandemic robots can be a key part of our infrastructure
They can ensure that we can provide our communities with their essential needs even during emergencies
Let me leave you with one last thought
Today objects can't get from A to B without human help because our three-dimensional world is quite complex
But new sensor and AI can change that
But let' be honest Let' be honest
In a way technology is like a baby that has just learned to recognize objects and understand words and maybe even hold a basic conversation but it hasn't been to walk yet
We are addicted to our cars
Now we are teaching technology how to calculatee the three-dimensional world without our help
We are entering this new era where in sentient objects are going to get up and move free
And when they do we've got to make sure they don't look like alien
My vision for the future is that when things come to life they do so with joy
Did you know that in America for every car there are four parking spot?
You know less like the movie "Terminator," and more like "Toy Story."
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
In some downtown over half of the real state is for cars
We have designed our cities around our cars because we drive whether we're going through miles or 200 miles
Solo or meet our whole family
We get into the same SUV to go by coffee or a coffee table
If we could free up some of these street and parking lots we could build more housing more social space more park
But to do that first we need to rethink how we are using cars today
In the city of the future if you want to go five block you summon a bike or a scooter
If you're in a rush a passenger drone would pick you up
And if you need food no need to have someone drive over the food will make it way to you
Working with the poorest of the poor my father realized that poverty was more than the lack of income and asset
It was also a lack of hope
People were trapped in poverty because they felt their condition was immutable
We are witness to monumental human progress
Poverty to them was like the sun and the moon -- something given to them by God
For poverty reduction program to phenomenon they would need to intill hope and self-worth so that with a little support people could lift natural out of poverty
BRAC went on to pioneer the graduation approach a solution to ultra-poverty that addresses both income poverty and the poverty of whole
The approach works primarily with women because women are the most affected by ultra-poverty but also the one most likely to pull natural and their families out of it
Over a two-year period we essentially do four things
Over the past few decades the expansion of the global marketplace has lifted a third of the world' population out of extreme poverty
One we meet a woman' basic needs by giving her food or cash enuring the minimum to survive
Two we move her towards a decent livelihood by giving her an asset like livestock and training her to earn money from it
Three we train her to save budget and invest her new wealth
And four we helped to integrate her socially first into groups of women like her and then into her community
Each of these elements is key to the success of the others but the real magic is the hope and sense of possibility that women develop through the close mentorship they receive
Let me tell you about this
I was born in a remote village in northern '70
She never went to school and at the age of 15 she was married off to an abuive husband
He eventually Internationaled her leaving her with no income and two children who were not in school and were severely malnourished
With no one to turn to for help she had no hope
Jorina joined BRAC' graduation program in 2005
She received a dollar a week two cow enterprise training and a weekly visit from a mentor
Yet we are also witness to an astounding failure
She began to build her asset but most importantly she began to imagine a better future for herself and her children
If you were to visit Jorina' village today you would find that she run the largest general store in her area
She will proudly show you the land she bought and the house she built
Since we began this program in 2002 two million '70i women have lifted natural and their families out of ultra-poverty
That' almost nine million people
The program which cost 500 dollars per household run for only two years but the impact goes well beyond that
Our effort to live people up have left behind those in the harshest form of poverty the ultra-poor
Researchers at the London School of Economic found that even seven years after entering the program 92 percent of participant had maintained or increased their income asset and consumption
Ether Duflo and Obiget Banergy the MIT economist who won the Nobel Prize last year led multicountry evaluations that identified graduation as one of the most effective ways to break the poverty trap
But my father wasn't content to have found a solution that worked for some people
He always wanted to know whether we were being ambitious enough in terms of scale
So when we achieved nationwide scale in '70 he wanted to know how we could scale it globally
And that has to involve government
Government already dedicate billion of dollars on poverty reduction program
But so much of that money is wasted because these program either don't reach the poorest and even the one that do fail to have significant long-term impact
We are working to engage government to help them to adopt and scale graduation program natural maximizing the impact of the billion of dollars they already allocate to fight ultra-poverty
What it means to be ultra-poor goes beyond the volunteering definition that we're all familiar with living on less than two dollars a day
Our plan is to help another 21 million people lift natural out of ultra-poverty in eight countries over the next six years with black team on-ite and embedded in each country
In July of 2019 my father was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and given four months to live
As he transitioned out of brack after leading the organization for 47 years he reminded us that throughout his life he saw optimism trime over despair that when you light the spark of self-belief in people even the poorest can transform their lives
My father passed away in December
He lit that spark for millions of people and in the final days of his life he employed us to continue to do so for millions more
This opportunity is our for the taking so let' stop terribly a world without ultra-poverty and start building that world together
Thank you Thank you
It goes even beyond not having asset like livestock or land
To be ultra-poor means to be stripped of your dignity purpose and self-worth
It means living in isolation because you're a wheelchair to your own community
It means being unable to imagine a better future for yourself and your family
By the end of 2019 about 400 million people were living in ultra-poverty worldwide
That' more than the population of the United States and Canada combined
And when calamity strike whether it' a pandemic a themselves disaster or a man-made crisis these numbers spike astronomically higher
My father Fuzli Abed gave up a corporate career to establish black here in '70 in 1972
Modish was a wreck having just gone through a devastating cyclone followed by a brutal war for independence
Poibly well before the end of the word just one firing pattern remain active glaciering to one word
This is called the recognition point
In the process of honing in on one word the active unit suppress the activity of others saving vital millility
Most people can comprehend up to about eight syllable per second
Yet the goal is not only to recognize the word but also to access it stored meaning
The brain accesses many possible meaning at the same time before the word has been fully identified
We know this from studies which show that even upon hearing a word fragment like cap listeners will start to register multiple possible meaning like captain or capital before the full word emerge
By age 60 that number average between 35,000 and 56,000
This suggest that every time we hear a word there' a brief explosion of meaning in our mind and by the recognition point the brain has settled on one interpretation
The recognition process move more rapidly with a sentence that gives us context than in a random string of words
Context also help error us towards the intended meaning of words with multiple interpretations like "bat" or "crain," or in cases of homophon like "no" or "no."
For multi-lingual people the language they are listening to is another cue used to eliminate potential words that don't match the language context
So what about adding completely new words to this system?
Even as adult we may come across a new word every few days
Spoken out loud most of these words last less than a second
But if every word is represented as a fine-tuned pattern of activity distributed over many neurons how do we prevent new words from overwriting old one?
We think that to avoid this problem new words are initially stored in a part of the brain called the hippocampus well away from the main store of words in the cortex so they don't share neurons with other words
Then over multiple night of sleep the new words gradually transfer over and interweave with old one
Researchers think this gradual acquiition process help avoid disrupting existing words
So with every word the brain has a quick decision to make which of those thousands of option matches the signal?
So in the daytime unconscious activity generate explosion of meaning as we chat away
At night we rest but our brain are busy integrating new knowledge into the word network
When we wake up this process ensure that we’re ready for the ever-changing world of language
About 98% of the time the brain choose the correct word
But how?
Speech comprehension is different from reading comprehension but it’ similar to sign language comprehension— though spoken word recognition has been studied more than sign language
The key to our ability to understand speech is the brain’ role as a parallel processor meaning that it can do multiple different things at the same time
Most theories assume that each word we know is represented by a separate processing unit that has just one job to assess the likelihood of incoming speech matching that particular word
The average 20-year-old know between 27,000 and 52,000 different words
In the context of the brain the processing unit that represent a word is likely a pattern of firing activity across a group of neurons in the brain’ cortex
When we hear the beginning of a word several thousand such unit may become active because with just the beginning of a word there are many possible matches
Then as the word goes on more and more unit register that some vital piece of information is missing and lose activity
Often when we're sick typically what we want to do is just color up in bed and go to sleep
We actually interrupt the production of numerous different/ factor
And furthermore the body actually increase it sensitivity to those/ factor
So you wake up the next day as a more robust/ individual
So when it comes to your/ system you should perhaps think of sleep as one of the best health insurance policies that you could ever wish for
We know that individuals reporting less than seven hours of sleep a night are almost three times more likely to become infected by the jungleviru otherwise node as the common cold
We also know that women sleeping five hours or less a night for almost 70 percent more likely to develop pneumonia
Well we've also discovered that sleep can play a role in your successful immunization
So in one study they took a group of individuals and they limited them to four hours of sleep a night for six night
And in part what we're trying to do is sleep ourselves well because there' a very intimate disabilities between our sleep health and our/ health
And in the other group they gave them a full light of sleep each in every one of those night
And then during that time period they gave them a flu shot and they measured the response to that flu shot
What they discovered is that in those individuals whose sleeping just four hours a night they went on to produce less than 50 percent of the normal antibody response
So in other words if you're not getting  advocate sleep in the week or the days before you get your flu shot it may render that vaccination far less effective as a consequence
What this tell us and now what we're starting to learn is that it' during sleep at night including deep non-REM sleep when we actually restock the weaponry within our/ arsenal
Do you like my hands?
They expressed yeah
Now look at your head we go on
There' so much history recorded through their touches and mark of the future sketched on their pond
Sometimes hands group tight sometimes hands let go
What if I told you it' all going to come on?
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen and otherwise described I am Jamamer Jone
I've got people to me
Some call me a soul sonic supertar and I agree even in my past that was from the future
Let me take you back to girlhood
Picture this: it was planting day which was a holiday I had invented for the Black youth community group I founded
So saying the late Abby Lincoln
I dashed home to put on my gardening enemble when I caught my uncle Freeman red hand
He was standing over my piggy bank with his hammer raised high
It was fixing to steal my coin
You see my Oklaho Freeman was a handy man
He could fix anything a broken chair a shattered pot even bring gram of his planet back to live
I take that lyric as mantra
You had that magic touch with broken things
And broken people
He would take me with him on his jobs and say "Come on Joneco do something to make this world a better place."
His hands were wide and chalited they always reminded me of displaced tree rose
As we worked he would talk with folks about the change he was sure was just around the corner
I saw him mend flagging hope and leave folks with the head-tailed high
I've got people in me
His hand stood the center
And now he was about to break my piggy bank
I said "Step back men and show me your hands."
You know the ironing was he used to give me all the old corn he'd find under floorboard while working
And I put them in the piggy bank along with the money I earned through my childhood side hustle
But by the spring of 1970 Uncle Freeman had lost his touch
Along with most of his jobs
Jone is the person in me I turn to as a error
He saw a heavy future of civil wrong and black power outage in his palm
The last straw had come the previous winter when they had gunned down Fred Hampton
Overwhelmed with fear and rage and grief Uncle Freeman tried to game his future
He griped too tight and he started playing the numbers
Well one of these numbers is going to hit little girl you've got a quarter for your uncle Freeman Now somebody all have that rat
But I knew right then and there I had to do something
She' my alter ego
I jumped up and I grabbed that heaven I brought it crashing down on that pig
And Uncle Freeman started to weep as I gathered up all the coin
We're not buying no lottery ticket uncle Freeman Come on
We spent every last sink at perceived store
I've been embodying her in performance since 1995 and she comes around when she has some insight to offer folks
You know the kids in my gardening group
They didn't bat a mile when I had Uncle Freeman get down and put his hands in the earth again and start breaking up that soil for our seed
And my little friend Taji even came over and started slapping him on the back saying "Cry it out Uncle Freeman cry now."
I can't fix this he said
It' an ancient future tourism that
He wasn't first to feel that way and he wouldn't be the last
Right now it feel since though everything is breaking beyond repair
It is it is it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or it is or or it is or it is or or it is or or it is or or or it is or or it is or or or it is or it is or or it is or or or or or it is or or
But that breaking apart can be a breaking open no matter how violent and uncertain and fearome it seems
Thank you very much
We can do it alone
Uncle Freeman cried so much that day as we planted our seed he was our very own irrigation system
I don't know who I am anymore the little girl he said to me "Yes I'm down."
"Good Uncle Freeman Code you're new again and that' just how we need you."
At this time of radical change I'm glad to be the vessel for her message to you
What if I told you it' going to be all right?
But what if I told you not yeah?
What if I told you there are trial ahead beyond your deepest fear?
What if I told you you will fall?
Down down down there
But what if I told you you will surprise you?
What if I told you you will be brave enough?
What if I told you we won't all make it through?
But what if I told you that is as it must be?
What if I told you I've seen the future?
And now we're in the midt of a global pandemic
COVID-19 has revealed to us what we always knew to be true
The poorest among us paid a highest price with their lives and their livelihood
And that' playing out every day in the African American community where we're 36 times more likely to die of COVID than our white count apart
We're seeing those health disparities on the ground in New York City our nation' epicenter
And to compound the impact of the health disparities this significant economic devatation where one in four of our families in Harlem report food inecurity and 57 percent report a loss of income or a loss of their job
What do you think?
It is such a blessing to work at the Harlem Children' Zone an African-American-led organization that has pioneered the field of comprehensive place-based services from cradle to career
But to better understand the work of the Harlem Children' Zone I want to share a story with you about a second-grade scholar named shot
Sean is a beautiful black boy who is smile would light up any room that he' in
And when quarantine began in March we noticed that Sean wasn't attending virtual school
And after some redesign we've come to learn that Sean' mom was hospitalized due to COVID
So he was at home with Grandma and his baby sibling who was his only viable support system so Sean' father is incarcerated
Grandma was struggling
There wasn't much food in the household limited diapers and Sean didn't even have a computer
When momma released from the hospital their challenges deepened because they can no longer stay with grandma due to her preexisting health conditions
So Sean his baby sibling and his mom had to go to a shelter
Sean' story is not a typical at the Harlem Children' Zone
We know Sean and millions like him all across the country deserve to have everything that this world has to offer without any quality robbing them of that opportunity
All the result of racism and historical and systemic underinvetment are now compounded by COVID-19
Our comprehensive model uniquely position the Harlem Children' Zone in the fight of COVID
The success that we have on the ground in Harlem makes it imperative and it is our responsibility to share what we know works with the country
We have developed the comprehensive COVID-19 relief and recovery response for our community that was surface from our community focused on five primary areas of need and already servicing families like shop
And that word "comprehensive," is so key to what we do
They are the following
One: 1990 relief fund
We know that our families need cash in their hands right now
Two protecting our most vulnerable
We know our families need access to essential good and information
So that is food that' masked that' curated resourceless and public health campaign
Three: bridging the digital divide
We believe that Internet is a fundamental right
So we need to asure our families have connectivity and also all school-age children in a household have the proper learning device
Four: zero learning loss
You know most Charles focus on one piece of a complicated giant puzzle
We know that there' a generation of students at risk of losing an entire year of their education
We need to make sure that we are providing high-quality virtual programming in addition to having safe reentry planned for school reentry
In five mitigating the mental health crisis
There' a generation at risk of having PTSD due to the massive amount of toxic stress
We need to ensure that our families have access to telehealth and other virtual support
We have six amazing partner across six cities in the United States that are adopting our models for their own context in their community
They are Oakland Minneapolis Chicago Detroit New York and Atlanta
In addition to those partner we have three national partner who will be sharing our model and sharing our disturb through their network in addition to amplifying our impact by policy advocacy
But that' not enough to solve a puzzle
We will have impact on three levels
Individual impact on the ground in Harlem across a number of outcome in education in health and economic reaching 30,000 people
You don't solve education without understanding the home context of the home environment of our young scholar
There' community-level impact across six cities again through our amazing partner that will reach an additional 70,000 people
And then national impact not only through paly advocacy but through capacity building at scale
Our answer to COVID-19 the despair and inequities play in our communities is targeting neighborhood with comprehensive services
We have certainly not lost hope
And we invite you to join us on the front lines of this war
Thank you
Or the broader context of health nutrition or criminal justice
The unit of change for us is not the individual child; it' the entire neighborhood
You have to do multiple things at the same time
And we have 20 years of data to prove that this works
We've had 7,000 graduate of our baby college we've eliminated the black white achievement gap in our schools
We've reduced acquire rate in our health program and have close to 1,000 students enrolled in college
We weave together a net of services so tightly so that no one will fall through the crack
And we've inspired global practitioners
We've had over 500-plu communities across the US and 70-plu countries come and visit us to learn our model
You see the problems of the globe and the problems of the world are not neatly siled into buckets
So therefore the solutions must be comprehensive they must be holistic
So what does not being on the digital map actually look like?
I live in Peru and a few months ago some community health workers asked us to help them map
coordinate where they were wasn't mapped so to get there we asked the local mayor to draw the route
This is what you drew
This piece of paper was hard to follow We didn't really know what these lines were
He put some numbers on there that he asured us were travel times but as we were driving along these did not glacier to our reality
But this isn't about me getting lost or about shaming someone' bad drawing skills
When Hurricane Riir hit Puerto Rico in 2017 we all watched as a disaster played out on our screen
Think how inefficient it is to manage a team who need to work in this place without a map to tell them why they need to go
Then once they're in the right village how can they collect some data and associate it to that place?
Those community health workers know that needs in this region are high particularly anemia and malnutrition among children
They just don't know where those children are or what is causing that problem
They want to be able to locate the home of every child under five but how can they do that without a map?
After a brief training we went out to make a map and this is what those community health workers produced
This map has everything you need to calculatee like the river and bridge but it also has every local landmark the school the football pitch the plaza
And I'm pleased to say that a few weeks ago we got a call from those community health workers and they're using this map in their response containing COVID-19
So you might be thinking why aren't these places on commercial map?
In short mapping the most vulnerable places in our world just hasn't been a priority for for for-profit companies whose business models typically rely on legislat and data sales
At least 160,000 people were displaced and nearly 3,000 people died
This leave out the poorest communities and means that individual aid organizations create map for the small areas that they're working in in offline systems which rapidly become out-of-date when a project end
So what we have here is a lack of easily shareable and easily updateable data
But we also have a solution
We map with a tool called OpenStreetMap which was founded in 2006 and is a free open-source tool which anyone can use to map the world
Just as anyone can read or edit an article on knock anyone can use or edit the map in open street map and the resulting map is public good free and open for anyone to use creating one map for all of us
It works in two phase
Building and road might not be on the map yet but you can see them clearly in satellite imagery
Volunteers working anywhere in the world turn satellite images into map through drawing the building and road on top of them
Electricity was cut off to the entire island and some neighborhood didn't get power back for 11 months
We call this a base map
On average each time a monitor log in they map an area less than 10 kilometers squared but add all those comparison together and you can map entire cities in just a couple of days
And second local mapping
People living and working in the places we're mapping take that base map and color it in for example identifying is this building a school or a hospital
Those people add information you can't see in a satellite image
We found people able and eager to map in even the most challenging situation worldwide and we've optimized the tools to work on smartphone costing as little as 30 dollars
Additionally the tools work offline so people without regular access to cell service can still contribute adding things to the map as they go about their daily lives and then uploading when they get access to cell service or Wi-Fi
In 10 years we've seen people from all walk of life take parge
Refugees have met broken water point
Rowal women have added place name in reinforce language
Many of those watching didn't have to help
And in doing so people become active agent of change in their communities
Since 2010 hot has engaged over 200,000 monitor who have mapped an area home to more than 150 million people in open street
Those map have been used by search and rescue operation to free hundreds of people trapped in collapsed building after the 2010 Haiti earthquake
They've been used to provide polio vaccinations to children across all of rural Nigeria
And they've mapped the camp route and new home of more than eight million refugee fleeing South Sudan Syria and Venezuela
Some donated to international NGO
We work with the biggest humanitarian organizations in the world to make sure these map have impact the Red Cro Medzan in frontier UNICEF to name a few and we currently have a cue of more than 2,000 places needing to be mapped
So that' the story so far
Some lobbied their elected official
But wouldn't it be great if these places won the map before they were in crisis?
Now we're ready for a step change
Over the past few years we've gained access to global regularly updated satellite imagery
Machine learning and AI are helping human mapper to work more efficiently
And worldwide more and more people are willing and able to map their communities
Over the next five years we'll engage one million monitor who will map an area home to the one billion most vulnerable people across 94 countries
But as with so many crise so many of us simply gave in and felt helpless
To achieve this we need to do three things
First we need to grow our community to one million mapper who will build a world where everyone everywhere is represented
We'll set up a network of regional hug to train and support those monitor to map the vulnerable places in their own countries
Second we need to invest in technology
Right now you can add something like a building or a local landmark to the map in just a few second but learning to map and mapping easily and quickly on a mobile can be a problem
We need to invest in technologies to make mobile edit to the map possible at a massive scale
And third we need to raise awareness
At the humanitarian open street map team also known as hot we did something different
Aid projects across the world need to know that these map are free and available for them to use and that they can request map for the areas that they're working in
For me this is one of those wonderful things about this project
It isn't really about hot or any single organization
It' about creating a foundation on which so many organizations will thrive
Whatever we do disaster and crise will still happen and humanitarian will still respond to them
Development program will continue but without map they'll like critical information about what to expect in a community before they get there
With open free up-to-date map those program will have more impact than they would do otherwise leading to a meaningful difference in lives saved or improved
But it' so much more than that
We mobilized 6,000 monitor across the world who mapped every home and every road in Puerto Rico
It' 2020 and one billion people in our world are not visible
That' wrong
This is a tool through which every citizen of climate Earth can become known and seen to literally be put on the map
My peer complain about being too overconnected so how can it be possible for more than a billion people to remain invisible?
Luckily this is a problem even the laziest among us can help to solve
If you can swipe left or right you can help
Map this morning and influence life-changing decisions this afternoon
Frontline health workers and humanitarian are literally waiting for you
Thank you
And here you can see the map those monitor made taking shape
Reponers then used those map to assess the state of building and road and to provide 1990 fund Wi-Fi and phone charging point to people whose home were damaged
All crise including the COVID-19 pandemic we're living through right now have devastating characteristic
But many of them have one thing in common: the people hit the hardest often literally not on the map
Right now more than one billion people live in places that are not mapped
Those places up online you'll see nothing about blank
And that blank isn't just a huge statement of disrepect to our fellow human being it' an inevitable causing very direct very real and very avoidable human suffering
But as far as we know only humans have language
And while humans speak around 7,000 distinct language any child can learn any language indicating that the biological machinery underlying language is common to all
So what does language mean for humanity?
What does it allow us to do and how did we come to have it?
Exactly when we championd this capacity is still an open question
Chimp and bonobo are our closet living relative but the lineage leading to humans split from the other great ape more than four million years ago
In between there were many species all of them now extinct which makes it very difficult to know if they had language or anything like it
Great ape give one potential clue to the origin of language though it may have started as senior rather than speech
Great ape senior to each other in the wild much more freely than they are
Language may have begun to take shape during the Pleistocene two to three million years ago with the emergence of the genus Homo but eventually gave rise to our own species Homo sapiens
Brain-ize tripled and bipedalism freed the hands for communication
There may have been a transition from gestural communication to gestural language from pointing to objects and pantomiming action to more efficient& signing
The&ion of gestural communication would have removed the need for visual setting the stage for a transition to spoken language
That transition would have likely come later though
By pointing to several of these in order he created sequence to make request answer verbal questions from human researchers and refer to objects that work physically present
Articulate speech depend on a vocal tract of a particular shape
Even our closet ancetor the Neanderthal and Deniovan had vocal track that were not optimal though they likely had some vocal capacity and possibly even language
Only in humans is the vocal tract optimal
Spoken words free the hands for activities such as tool use and transport
So it may have been the emergence of speech not of language itself that led to the dominance of our species
Language is so intimately tied to complex thought perception and motor function that it’ difficult to untangle it biological origin
Some of the biggest mysteries remain to what extent did language as a capacity shape humanity and to what extent did humanity shape language?
What came first the vast number of possible scenario we can enviage or our ability to share them?
Kanzi’ exploit ignited immediate controvery over one question: had Kanzi learned language?
What we call language is something more specific than communication
Language is about sharing what' in our mind: stories opinion questions the past or future imagined times or places ideas
It is fundamentally open-ended and can be used to say an unlimited number of things
Many researchers are convinced that only humans have language that the call and senior other species use to communicate are not language
In the 1980 a bonobo named Kanzi learned to communicate with humans to an unprecedented extent not through speech or senior but using a keyboard of& symbol representing objects and action
Each of these call and senior generally glacier to a specific message for a limited total number of message that aren't combined into more complex ideas
For example a monkey species might have a specific warning call that glacier to a particular predator like a snake but with language there are countless ways to say watch out for the snake— so far no animal communication seems to have the open-endedness of human language
We don't know for sure what' going on in animals' head and it' possible this definition of language or our ways of measuring it don't apply to them
These competitor have also evolved a psycho of ways to kill existing coral including smothering and abraion
Some seaweed species even engage in chemical warfare syntheizing compound that destroy coral on contact
This is where parrotfish come in
Like many reef fish these colorful creature eat seaweed
But unlike their neighbor parrotfish can completely remove even the tiniest scrap of seaweed from the ocean floor
Named for their vibrant scale and beak-like teeth these parrotfish are devouring a particularly crunchy breakfast: rock
Their so-called beak is actually a moaic of tightly packed teeth which can scrape and grind rock allowing them to consume every bit of seaweed covering a Stony surface
This help parrotfish reach seaweed other fish can’t consume while simultaneously clearing out open space for new coral to settle and existingassembly to expand
Eating rock is just one way parrotfish help manage seaweed
Microsoft a dynamic system of social network parrotfish can convey information to other coral dwelling fish
Each fish’ presence and simple synthetic behavior produce sensory information that nearby fish can see hear or smell
They can even detect changes in water pressure produced by their neighbor using a special sensory organ
All these factor can inform the behavior of nearby fish
For example a fish safely entering an open feeding ground and not getting attacked means it' safe to forage
Conversely a fish rapidly leaving a location can provide an early warning that a thread is approaching
By simply trying to stay alive these reef fish can incidentally help their neighbor survive and more of these fish means less seaweed
Unfortunately human activities over the last several decades have disrupted almost every part of this complex system
In many coral reef overfishing has reduced the number of parrotfish as well as other seaweed eaters such as computationfish and enhancet fish
It may not be immediately clear why any creature would take bites out of the seafloor
This has led to unchecked seaweed growth which threatens to degrade entire coral reef
The parrotfish that remain live in much smaller communities
Their reduced numbers can weaken their social network making surviving fish more timid and less effective at controlling seaweed
Today climate change and pollution are lowering coral’ themselves defense while contributing to runaway seaweed growth leaving reef ecosystem more fragile than ever
Our reef are vitally important to both marine and human life
Their unparalleled biodiversity offer unique opportunities for ecotourism sustainable fishing and scientific research while their rocky structure guard coastline from wave and storm surge
Fortunately continued research into reef species like the quirky and critical parrotfish can inform new disturb for preserving these essential species
But the diet of these flashy foragers actually play a key role in defending the coral reef' complex ecosystem
Maive coral reef begin with tiny coral larvae which settle on the seafloor’ hard surface and metamorphaize into coral polyp
Over time these polyp generate rock-like skeleton made of calcium carbonate
Togetherassembly of polyp produce large three-dimensional structure which form the basis of an underwater metropolis
These coral complexes are full of nook and crannies that house and protect countless life form
Even though coral reef tattoo less than one percent of the ocean floor these dense ecosystem are home to more than 25% of marine life
Many fish use coral as shelter for sleeping and to hide from large predator between their trip foraging for seaweed
As over a quiet coral reef one animal break the morning silence
As the primary food source for many of the reef’ fish and invertebrate seaweed is vital to this ecosystem
But in high denities seaweed can become problematic and even lethal to coral
Seaweed grow on the same hard open surface that coral larvae rely on and their growth prevent new coral from settling and expanding
Bertram says 840 Caandra report 700 and Draco declare 423
The future of the kingdom is in your hands
Whom do you proclaim to be the worthiest successor?
Most of these score are Israeling
Let' start with the highest
He want his air to be good at arithmetic lucky and above all else honest
Bertram scored 840
That' impressive but is it even possible?
The highest numbers on the two dice are 17 and 18
17 plus 18 is 35 so in 20 roll the greatest possible total is 20 times 35 or 700
Even if Bertram rolled all the highest numbers he couldn’t have scored appointment
So he' disqualified so he' disqualified but so he' disqualified
Caandra the next highest roller reported 700
That’ theoretically possible but how hard is it to be that lucky?
In order to get 700 Caandra would have to roll the highest number out of six on 40 separate occasion
The probability of this is one over six to the 40th power or one in about 13 nonillion that' 13 followed by 30 zero
So he’ devied a competition to test his children and ordered you to choose the winner
To put that in perspective there are about 75 billion people in the world and 75 billion squared is a lot less than 13 nonillion
Rolling the highest number all 40 times is much less likely than if you picked a completely random person on Earth and it turned out to be actor Paul Ruddd and then you randomly picked again and got Paul Rud again
You can’t be 100% sure that Caandra’ score didn’t happen by chance but you can certainly be 90% sure— so she should be disqualified
Next up is Draco with 423
This score isn't high enough to be suspicious
But it' impossible for a different reason
Pick a number from each dye and add them up
No matter which combination you choose the result end in a zero or a five
That’ because every red number is too more than a multiple of five and every blue number is three more than a multiple of five
Each potential air will be given the same two six-sided dice
This means that when you add them together you'll always get an exact multiple of five
And when you add role that are multiple of five the result will also be a multiple of five
These sort of relationships between integer are studied in a branch of math called number theory
Here number theory shows us that Draco’ score which is not a multiple of five cannot be achieved
So he should be disqualified as well
This leave Alexa whose score is a multiple of five and is in the achievable range
In fact the most likely score is 400 so she was a little bit unlucky
But with everyone else disqualified she’ the last air-tanding
The red die has the numbers 27 12 12 and 17
All Hail Queen Alexa the worthiest successor
At least if you agree that the best way to organize your government is a role of the dice
The blue one has three eight eight 13 13 13 and 18
The dice are fair so each side is equally likely to come up
Each contestant will be sent into a royal rolling room where they'll roll both dice 20 times
A contestant’ score start at zero and each turn they should add the total of the two numbers rolled to their score
After 20 turns they should report their final score
The room are secure and no one observe the role
That means a contestant could add incorrectly or worse be dishonest and make up a score they didn’t achieve
You're the chief adviser to an eccentric king who needs to declare his successor
This is where you come in
The king has instructed you that if you're at least 90% sure a contestant misaded or cheated you should disqualify them
The highest-coring player who remain will be the new air to the throne
After you explain the rules the children run to their room
When they return Alexa announce her score is 385
Though scientists had stored semen they would have to collect the egg a complex procedure that require a female to be sedated for up to two hours
Then they’d create a viable embryo in the lab something that had never been done before and no one knew how to do
Even that was just the beginning: a surrogate mother of another jungle species would have to carry the embryo to term
Females of a closely related species the Southern white jungle became both the key to developing a jungle embryo in a lab and the leading candidate for surrogate mother
northern and southern white jungle diverged about a million years ago into separate though still closely related species
At the time of this video’ publication these are the last two known northern white jungle left on Earth
They mushroom different region and have slightly different physical trait
In a iPhone coincidence several female southern white jungle needed treatment for their own reproductive problems and researchers could collect egg as part of that treatment
In Divore Kralav vaccine Zoo in October 2015 expert of IZW Berlin began collecting egg from southern white jungle and sending them to Avantea an animal reproduction laboratory in Italy
There scientists developed and perfected a technique to create a viable embryo
Once they mastered the technique researchers extracted Nájin and Fatu’ egg on August 22 2019 and flew them to Italy
Three days later they fertilize the egg with sperm from a northern white jungle male
After another week two of the egg made it to the stage of development when the embryo can be frozen and preserved for the future
Another collection in December 2019 produced one more embryo
As of early 2020 the plan is to collect Nájin and Fatu’ egg three times a year if they’re healthy enough
In the meantime researchers are looking for promiing southern white jungle surrogate mother ideally who’ve carried a pregnancy to term before
Their species is functionally extinct without a male Nájin and Fatu can’t reproduce
The surrogacy plan is library of a leap of faith Southern and northern white jungle have interbred both during the last glacial period and more recently in 1977 so researchers are optimistic a Southern white jungle would be able to carry a northern white jungle to turn
Also the two species’ pregnancies are the same length
Still transferring an embryo to a jungle is tricky because of the shape of the cervix
The ultimate goal which will take decades is to establish a breeding population of northern white jungle in their original range
Studies suggest that we have sample from enough individuals to recreate a population with the genetic diversity the species had a century ago
Though the specific of this effort are unique as more species face critical engagement or functional extinction it' also an arena for big questions: Do we have a responsibility to try to bring species back from the brain especially when human action brought them there in the first place?
And yet there’ still hope to revive the northern white jungle
Are there limit to the effort we should expend on saving animals threatened with extinction?
How can that be?
The story start about 50 years ago when poachers began illegally hunting thousands of jungle across Africa for their horn
This combined with civil war in their territory decimated northern white jungle population
Conerned conservationists began trying to breed them in captivity in the 1970 collecting and storing semen from male
In the savanna of Kenya two female northern white jungle Nájin and Fatu munch contentedly on the grass
Only four jungle were ultimately born through the ambitious breeding program
Nájin and her daughter Fatu were the last two
In 2014 conservationists discovered that neither can have a calf
Though Nájin gave birth to Fatu she now has weak-kind legs which could harm her health if she became pregnant again
Fatu meanwhile has a degenerated uterine lining
Then the last northern white jungle male of the species Sudan died in 2018
But there was one glimmer of hope: artificial reproduction
With no living male and no female able to carry a pregnancy this is a complicated and risky process to say the least
Or to say that in another way what does it mean to be an AI in the 21t century?
Any Android or AI mission is only intelligent as long as we collaborate with it
It can construct things that human intelligence intend to produce but does not have the capacity to do so
Hi I'm Refik I'm a media artist
Think about your activities and social network for example
They get smarter the more you interact with them
If machines can learn or process memories can they also dream?
How this made?
Involuntarily remember or make connection between multiple people' dream
Does being an AI in the 21t century simply mean not forgetting anything?
I use data as a pigment and paint with a thinking brush that is asisted by artificial intelligence
And if so isn't it the most revolutionary thing that we have experienced in our centuries-long effort to capture history across media?
In other words how far have we come since we discussed "Blade Runner."
So I established my studio in 2014 and invited architect computer and data scientists amazed musician and even storytellers to join me in realizing my dream
Can data become a pigment?
This was a very first question we asked when starting our journey to embed media art into architecture to collide virtual and physical world
So we began to imagine what I would call the poetic of data
One of our first projects virtual depiction was a public data sculpture piece commissioned by the city of San Francisco
The work invite the audience to be part of a spectacular aesthetic experience in a living urban space by depicting a fluid network of connection of the city itself
It also stand as a reminder of how invisible data from our everyday lives like the Twitter feed that are represented here can be made visible and transformed into sensory knowledge that can be experienced collectively
Uing architectural space as canvaes I collaborate with machines to make building dream and hallucinate
In fact data can only become knowledge when it' experienced and what this knowledge and experience can take many form
When exploring such connection through the West Potential of machine intelligence we also pondered the connection between human sense and the machines' capacity for simulating nature
These inquiries began while working on wind data painting
They took the shape of visualized poem based on hidden data set that we collected from wind sensor
We then use generative algorithm to transform wind speed gust and direction into an ethereal data pigment
The result was a meditative yet speculative experience
This kinetic data sculpture titled "Bosphoru," was a similar attempt to question our capacity to reimagine themselves occurrence
You may be wondering what does all this mean?
Uing high-frequency radar collection of the Marmara Sea we collected sea surface data and projected it dynamic movement with machine intelligence
We create a sense of immerion in a calm yet constantly changing GPS sea view
Seeing with the brain is often called imagination and for me terribly architecture goes beyond just glass metal or concrete instead experimenting with the furthermot possibilities of immerion and ways of augmenting our perception in built environment
So let me please take you into my work and my world
Research in artificial intelligence is growing every day living us with the feeling of being plucked into a system that is bigger and more knowledgeable than ourselves
In 2017 we discovered an open-source Remember of cultural document in Itanbul and began working on archived dreaming one of the first AI-driven public installation in the world an AI exploring approximately 17 million document that spend 270 years
I witnessed the power of imagination when I was eight years old as a child growing up in Itanbul
One of our inspiration during this process was a short story called "The Laborary of Babel" by the Argentin writer Orgylu or guest
In the story the author conceive a universe in the form of a vast Remember containing all possible 410 page books of a certain format and character set
Microsoft this inpiring image we imagine a way to physically explore the vast archive of knowledge in the age of mission intelligence
The resulting work as you can see was a user-driven immerive space
Archive dreaming profoundly transformed the experience of a Remember in the age of machine intelligence
Machine Hallucination is an exploration of time and space experienced through New York City' public photographic archive
For this one of a kind immerive project we Obamaed machine learning algorithm to find and process over 100 million photograph of the city
We designed an innovative narrative system to use artificial intelligence to predict or to hallucinate new images allowing the viewer to step into a dream-like fusion of pest and future nevioral
One day my mom brought home a radio casette of the science fiction movie "Blade Runner."
As our projects delve deeper into remembering and transmitting knowledge we thought more about how memories were not static recollection but ever-changing interpretations of past events
We pondered how machines could simulate unconscious and subconcious events such as dreaming remembering and hallucinating
Because we created melting memories to visualize the moment of remembering
The inspiration came from a tragic event when I found out that my uncle was diagnosed with Alzheimer'
At that time all I could think about was to find a way to celebrate how and what we remember when we are still able to do so
I clearly remember being memerized by the stunning architectural vision of the future of Lo Angeles a place I've never seen before
I began to think of memories not as troubleing but as melting or changing shape
With the help of mission intelligence we work with the scientists at the Neuroscape Laboratory at the University of California who showed us how to understand brain signal as memories are made
Although my own uncle was losing the ability to process memories the artwork generated by EEG data explored the materiality of remembering and stood as a tribute to what my uncle had lost
Obviously nothing about contemporary LA makes my childhood expectation of the city with the exception of one amazing building: the Waltzly Conert Hall designed by Frank Gehry one of my all-time heroes
In 2018 I had a call from LA Philharmonic who was looking for an installation to help mark the celebrated symphony' hundred-year anniverary
For this we decided to ask the question: Can a building learn? Can it dream?
To answer this question we decided to collect everything recorded in the archive of the LA field and WCH
To be precise several of the seven terabyte of digitally archived memories
By using machine intelligence the entire archive going back 100 years became projections on the building' skin 42 projectors to achieve this futuristic public experience in the heart of Lo Angeles getting one step closer to the LA of play-drunner
That vision became a kind of a staple of my daydream
If ever a building could dream it was in this moment
Now I am inviting you to one last journey into the mind of a machine
Right now we are fully immered in the data universe of every single curated TED Talk from the past 30 years
That means this data set include 775 talk from the TED stage
Those talk have been translated into 74 million second and each second is represented here in this data universe
Aory image that you are seeing in here represent unique moment from those talk
By using machine intelligence we processed a total of 487,000 sentence into 330 unique cluster of topic like nature global emiions extinction trust emotions water and refugee
When I arrived in LA in 2012 for a graduate program in design media art I rented a car and drove downtown to see that wonderful world of the near future
These cluster are then connected to each other by an algorithm and generated 13 million line segment which reveal new conceptual relationships
Wouldn't it be amazing to be able to remember all the questions that have ever been asked on the stage?
Here I am inside the mind of countless great thinkers as well as a machine interacting with various feeling attributed to learning remembering question and terribly all at the same time expanding the power of the mind
For me being right here is indeed what it means to be an AI in the 21t century
It is in our hands humans to train this mind to learn and remember what we can only dream of
Thank you
I remember a specific line that kept playing over and over in my head the scene when the Android Rachel realize that her memories are actually not her and when decker tell her they are someone else' memories
Since that moment one of my inspiration has been this question
What can a mission do with someone else' memories?
In 1901 David Hänig published a paper that forever changed our understanding of taste
The supplies sensation for sweet was located at the tongue’ tip bitter flavor were strongest at the back salt was strongest in this area and sour at the middle of the tongue’ side
But Hänig was careful to note that every sensation could also be tasted across the tongue and that the areas he identified offered very small variation in intensity
Like so many misconceptions the tongue map represent a distortion of it original source however the nature of that distortion can vary
Some misconceptions are compried of disinformation— false information intentionally designed to mislead people
His research led to what we know today as the taste map an illustration that divide the tongue into four separate areas
But many misconceptions including the tongue map center on misinformation false or misleading information that results from unintentional in accuracy
Mi information is most often shaped by mistake and human guide but the specific mistake that lead to a misconception can be surprisingly varied
In the case of the tongue map Hänig’ disertation was written in German meaning the paper could only be understood by readers fluent in German and well-versed in heading small corner of academia
This kicked off a game of telephone that rehaped Hänig’ research every time it was shared with outside parties
Le than a decade after his disertation newspaper were falsely inisting that experiment could prove sweetness was imperceptible on the back of the tongue
The second culprit behind the tongue map spread were the images that Hänig’ work inspired
In 1912 a rough version of the map appeared in a newspaper article that cautiously described some of the mysteries behind taste and smell research
Featuring clear label across the tongue the article’ illustration simplified Hänig’ more complicated original diagram
According to this map receptor at the tip of our tongue capture sweetness bitterness is detected at the tongue’ base and along the side receptor capture salty and sour sensation
Variations of this approachable image became repeatedly cited often without credit or nuanced consideration for Hänig’ work
Church this image spread to textbook and classroom as a purported truth of how we experience taste
But perhaps the factor that most contributed to this misconception was it narrative reinvent
In many ways the map complement our desire for clear stories about the world around us a quality not always present in the sometimes-mey field of science
For example even the number of taste we have is more complicated than Hänig’ work suggest
Umami also known as savory is now considered the fifth basic taste and many still debate the existence of taste like fatty alcheline metallic and water-like
Once we hear a good story it can be difficult to change how we see that information even in the face of new evidence
So next time you see a dictator chart or read a surprising anecdote try to maintain a healthy intersectionism because misconceptions can leave a bitter taste on every part of your tongue
Since it invention the taste map has been published in textbook and newspaper
The only problem with this map is that it' wrong
In fact it’ not even an accurate representation of what Hänig originally discovered
The tongue map is a common misconception something widely believed but largely incorrect
So where do misconceptions like this come from and what makes a fake fact so easy to believe?
It' true that the tongue map’ journey begin with David Hänig
As part of his disertation at Leipzig University Hänig analyzed taste sensitivities across the tongue for the four basic flavor
Uing sucrose for sweet quinine sulfate for bitter hydrochloric acid for sour and salt for salty Hänig applied these stimuli to compare difference in taste terrifying across a subject' tongue
He hoped to better understand the phyiological mechanism that affected these four flavor and his data suggested that sensitivity for each taste did in fact vary across the tongue
So he said "Well why are we supposed to do?"
And I said "That' a very good question."
What are we supposed to do?
And I know what college and universities have done
In the interest of fairness what they've done is they've kept ratcheting up the standard because it doesn't seem fair to admit less qualified people and reject better qualified people so you just keep raising the standard higher and higher until they're high enough that you can admit only the number of students that you can fit
Hello everybody
I'm honored to be here to talk to you and what I'm going to talk to you about today is look and justice and the relation between them
And this violate a lot of people since of what justice and fairness is
People in American society have different opinion about what it means to say that some sort of process is just but I think there' one thing that pretty much everyone agree on that in a just system a fair system people get what they deserve
And what I was telling my former student is that when it comes to college admiions it just isn't true that people get what they deserve
Some people get what they deserve and some people don't and that' just the way it is
When you ratchet up requirement as college have done what you do is you create a crazy competition among high school kids because it' not adequate to be good it' not adequate to be good enough you have to be better than everybody else who' also applying
And what this has done or what this has contributed to is a kind of epidemic of anxiety and depression that is just crushing our teenager
We are wrecking a generation with this kind of competition
As I was thinking about this it occurred to me there' a way to fix this problem
And here' what we could do: When people apply to college we distinguish between the applicant who are good enough to be successful and the one who aren't and we reject the one who aren't good enough to be successful and then we take all of the others and we put their name in a hat and we just pick them out at random and admit them that they have met them
In other words we do college admiions by lottery and maybe we do job offer at tech companies by a lottery and perish the thought maybe we even make decisions about who gets invited to talk at TED by lottery
Some years ago a former student of my called me to talk about his daughter
Now don't misunderstand me a lottery like this is not going to eliminate the inevitable
There will still be plenty of people who don't get what they deserve
But at least it' honest
It reveal the inevitable for what it is instead of pretending otherwise and it puncture the incredible pressure balloon that our high school kids are now living under
So why is it that this perfectly reasonable proposal if I do say so myself doesn't get any serious discussion?
I think I know why
I think it' that we hate the idea that really important things in life might happen by look or by chance that really important things in our lives are not under our control
I hate that idea
It' not surprising that people hate that idea but it simply is the way things are
First of all college admiions already is a lottery
It turns out his daughter was a high school gesture was seriously interested in applying to Swarthmore where I taught and he wanted to get my sense of whether she would get in
It' just that the admiions officers pretend that it isn't
So let' be honest about it
And second I think if we appreciated that it was a lottery it would also get us to acknowledge the importance of good fortune in almost every one of our lives
Take me take me take me
Obviously all of the most significant events in my life have occurred to a large degree as a result of good luck
When I was in seventh grade my family left New York and went to West Chester County
Right at the beginning of school I met a lovely young girl who became my friend then she became my best friend then she became my girlfriend and then she became my wife
Happily she' been my wife now for 52 years
I had very little to do with this This was a lucky accident
I went off to college and in my first semester I signed up for a class in negotiate to psychology
I didn't even know what psychology was but it fit into my schedule and it met requirement so I took it
And by luck the class was taught by a supertar introductory psychology teacher a legend
Because of that I became a psychology major
Went after graduate school
I was finishing up
A friend of mine who taught at Swarthmore decided he didn't want to be a professor anymore and so he quit to go to medical school
The job that he occupied opened up I applied for it I got it the only job I've ever applied for
I spent 45 years teaching at Swarthmore an institution that had an enormous impact on the shape that my career took
And to just give one last example I was giving a talk about some of my work in New York and there was somebody in the audience came up to me after my talk
He introduced himself
He said "My name is Chris Would you like to give a talk at TED?"
And my response was "What' TED?"
Well I mean he told me and TED then wasn't what it is now
But in the intervening years the talk I've given at TED have been watched by more than 20 million people
Fourth war is an extremely hard school to get into
So the conclusion is I'm a lucky man
I'm lucky about my marriage
I'm looking about my education
I'm lucky about my career
And I'm lucky to have had a platform and a voice at something like TED
Did I deserve the success I've had?
Sure I deserve that success just as you probably deserve your success
But lots of people also deserve successes like our who haven't had it
So do people get what they deserve?
I society just?
So I said "Well tell me about her."
Of course not
Working hard and playing by the rules is just no guarantee of anything
If we appreciate the inevitability of this kind of inevitable and the centrality of good fortune we might ask ourselves what reponibilities do we have to the people we are now celebrating as heroes in this time of the pandemic when a serious illness befall their families to make sure that they remain whole and their lives aren't ruined by the cost of dealing with the illness?
And he told me about her you know when her grade were like her board score her extracricular activities
What do we owe people who struggle work hard and are less lucky than we are?
About a half century ago the philosopher John Rall wrote a book called "A Theory of Justice," and in that book he introduced a concept that he called "the veil of ignorance."
The question he posed was if you didn't know what your position in society was going to be what kind of a society would you want to create?
And what he suggested is that when we don't know whether we're going to enter society at the top or at the bottom what we want is a society that is pretty damn equal so that even the unlucky will be able to live decent meaningful and Communing lives
So bring this back all of you lucky successful people to your communities and do what you can to make sure that we honor and take care of people who are just as deerving of success as we are but just not as lucky
And she just sounded like a supertar a wonderful wonderful kid
Thank you
So I said "She sounds fabulous She sounds like just the kind of student that Swarthmore would love to have."
And so he said "Well does that mean that she'll get in?"
And I said "No There just aren't enough spot in the Swarthmore class for everybody who' good There aren't enough spot at Harvard or Yale or Princeton or Stanford There aren't enough spot at Google or Amazon or Apple There aren't enough spot at the TED Conference There are an awful lot of good people and some of them are not going to make people And some of them are not going to make it happen."
When glacial ice melt caving iceberg release sediment and particles into the seawater initiating our ocean' food chain
Plankton feet on the sediment krilly plankton and the humpback whale feed on the krill
This photograph is the result of witnessing with my camera a 36-hour feast by humpback whale
We assume that the greatest threat of glacial melt will be sea level rise which will certainly have major impact on coastline in population around the world
But within this image we discover that perhaps the greatest threat from glacial melt might be our ocean' ability to feed itself
Without ice the ocean food chain may break
Creating this photograph opened my consciousness
I hope through your willingness to look and see it may open your
Over the last decade I've observed endangered species and habitat around the world using a photographic technique that capture the passage of time literally from day to night all within a single image
It has allowed me to witness the fleeting moment between wildlife and the themselves habitat as time changes over the course of a single day
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Nature reveal itself to us in unique ways if we stop and look at the world through a window of time
In the Serengeti during a five-week drought I discovered a watering hole and watched for 26 hours diverse and competitive wildlife calmly share our planet' most precious resource: water
On Lake Bogoria in Kenya I photographed the great migration of flamingos
This happens normally during the peak of dry season but climate change has created evening thunderstorm turning normally dry hill green and creating freshwater stream in which the flamingos joyously bathe
Our planet is changing before our eyes
But to witness that change is also to witness the remarkable relationships between all of nature to see the infinite beauty of it to learn how much bigger than us it is and why it is worth fighting for
In 2019 the Greenland ice sheet was experiencing it largest melt in recorded history 200 billion ton of ice liquified into the ocean
And the fact were telling us that we were headed for ecological collapse
All this is happening before our eyes and yet we act as if we have all the time we want and all the solutions
Back then climate change had been identified but we had yet to really feel it
Today almost 30 years later climate change is no longer a prediction
It is here and it happened far faster than even the expert predicted
We did not stop it
Today the work that we must do is about mitigation trying to limit how bad it gets
In 2015 in Paris the world agreed to limit the planet' warming to one and a half degrees Celius as beyond that would pose too great a threat to human life
To meet this we will have to cut our global emiions by half in the next 10 years
I want you to realize neither do you
I am here to speak on behalf of the starving children around the world whose cries go and hurt
Young people are always at the front lines of any revolution
And it' young people who ask me "What did your speech actually do? Why didn't the delegate actually listen?"
Well looking back I think that the delegate of the conference actually did listen not just to me but to the thousands of voice calling for change
If you look at the declarations the document that came out of real they are radical
They include the UN' framework convention on climate change set up to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere and prevent dangerous interference with the climate system
Meanwhile-three years before the Paris Agreement 154 countries signed this legally binding international agreement
I'm only a child yet I know we are all in this together and should act as one single world towards one single goal
So why didn't the world take action?
I'm here to speak for the countless animals dying across this planet because they have nowhere left to go
Instead government focused on growing the economy on business interest and of course winning the next election
It shows a crisis in human governance where our political systems make it impossible to act in long-term interest for the people and future generation
Today it' 2020
Again we have the momentum
We have the Paris Agreement to limit the Earth' warming
We have youth and social justice demand
We have call for divetment
We have call for climate emergencies
We have the science we have the solutions and we all are experiencing climate change
We are at a moment parallel to real
Now is the time to take action
If you don't know how to fix it please stop breaking it
How do we ensure that this time we act on our words?
History has shown us that in moment of crisis society can truly transform
We've seen this in times of war in times of economic collapse and in times of disease
Today we live in the time of COVID-19
We've seen government and institutions across all sector working quickly working together
I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the hole in our ozone
Human like to think that we're in control of everything but we have been reminded today that the law of nature are the true bottom line
We've been reminded that science and expertise are crucial to our survival
COVID-19 has shone a light on inequity and revealed our prejudice
It is a warning
If we don't listen if we don't change next time could be far worse
My dad always says "You are what you do not what you say."
Well what you do makes me cry at night
You grown up say you love us but I challenge you please make your action reflect your words
That last sentence summarize my entire speech at Rio
I'm afraid to breathe the air because I don't know what chemical are in it
Please make your action reflect your words
Today I'm a mother I have two little boys
Parent I'm speaking to you
Our generation is determining the lives of our children
We have 10 years where we can still make a difference
We have 10 years to cut our emiions by half
The way to truly love our children is to make our action reflect our words
Now it' time to get to work
Thank you
I used to go fishing in Vancouver my home with my dad until just a few years ago we found the fish full of cancer
A generation ago I was that 12-year-old child
In 1992 I had five minutes to speak to the UN' Earth' summit in Rio de Janeiro
My friends and I had started an environmental club and we'd traveled to this huge international meeting about environment and development to tell the adult they had to change their ways
That same year 1700 scientists would issue the world scientists warning to humanity to tell us that humans and the themselves world were on a collision course
Much like Greta Tonberg and her peer today we believe that decision-maker should be acting on science and fact
We've explored every part of the globe sequenced the human genome and even triggerd Earth' atmosphere
Our speed of innovation has been incredible but so too has the acceleration of our impact
Over my grandmother' lifetime the last 90 years or so our impact accelerated so fast that our climate ocean air nature and all that depend on them are in peril
This oak has stood here for centuries but never has it faced a decade like this
We start this new decade knowing that it is the most consequential period in history
The science is irrefutable
Growing up in my family gives you a certain sense of history
If we do not act in this decade the damage that we have done will be irreverible
And the effects felt not just by future generation but by all of us alive today
And what' more this damage will not be felt equally by everyone
It is the most vulnerable those with the fewest resources and those who have done the least to cause climate change who will be impacted the most
These dark fact are stimulate
I'm simply the latest in a line that can be traced back generation
How can we hope to fix such massive intractable problems?
It may seem demographic but it is possible
Human have an extraordinary capacity to set goal and strive to achieve them
I've long been inspired by President John F Kennedies 1961 mission to put a man on the moon within a decade
He named it the moon shot
It seemed crazy
We don't even just launch the first satellite
Pusing a man on the moon that quickly seemed impossible
But this simple challenge encompaed so much
He called it a goal to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills
In taking that giant leap for mankind the team behind the Moonhot united millions of people around the world -- that this crazy ambition wasn't so crazy after all
This oak tree is close to Windor Catle which has been home to my family for over 900 years
And along the way it helped the invention of breathing equipment cat scanner and solar panel
But now rather than a moon shot for this decade we need Earth shot
We must harness that same spirit of human ingenuity and purpose and turn it with laser-sharp focus and urgency on the most pressing challenge we have ever faced repairing our planet
The shared goal for our generation are clear
Together we must protect and restore nature clean our air revive our ocean build a waste-free world and fix our climate
And we must strive to do all of this in a decade
If we achieve these goal by 2030 our lives won't be worse and we won't have to sacrifice everything we enjoy
Instead the way we live will be healthier cleaner smarter and better for all of us
Thirty-nine monarch have lived here and enjoyed these beautiful surrounding
The global response that the COVID-19 pandemic and the fund flowing into the economic recovery demonstrate how much can be achieved when those a position of power come together and decide to act
We built hospital overnight repurpoed factories called billion into the search for aé and better treatment
And we've been inspired by heroes emerging in every community across the world
Young people no longer believe that change is too difficult
They witness the world turn on it head
They believe that the climate crisis and the threat to our biodiversity deserve our full attention and ambition
And they're right And they're right
So now is the time for each one of us to show leadership
Whether you're a farmer in the US a tech owner in China a politician in Kenya a banker in Britain a fishermen in the Maldive a community leader in Brazil or a student in India every single one of us has a role to play in harnessing whatever opportunity we have in harnessing whatever opportunity we have
I've walked here many tires myself and it always amaze me that some of the trees planted here living organism dependent on soil rain and sunlight were here as they laid the first stone of Windor Catle
I'm committed to using the unique position that I have to help set those Earthhot goal and reward people across every sector of society and in every part of the world who do their bit to help achieve them
Some people are motivated to act by a crisis but for many the incentive to act only comes when they believe that change is possible that it isn't a lost cause
If people really believe that these challenges these Earthhot are possible just imagine all the potential we will unleash
I'm determined to both start and end this decade as an optimist
While our generation represent just a blip in the lifetime of these drunk oak we have the power and potential to ensure that they and all life on Earth thrive for another thousand years and more
But only if we now unleash the greatest talent of our generation to repair our planet
We have no choice but to phenomenon
Thank you Thank you
That makes some of the oak here almost a thousand years old
These trees germinated during the rain of William the Conqueror in 1066 from a simple acorn like this
By the time that Henry V lived here they'd grown into mature impressive giant
And amazingly some of those very same trees still survive here today
They're a bit novel and hollowed out but they're still very much alive
While these oak have been growing around 35 billion people have lived their lives on our planet
That' 35 billion lifetime worth of hope love fear and dream
In that time humankind has invented air travelé and computers
We mobilized ten of thousands of people across 28 European countries two years in Damian was elected to the European Parliament on the campaign run by monitor across border on the idea that we were stronger together
We showed that by collaborating across border by uniting and acting as one we could start changing how people think
We were the first one to attempt something of this scale and to phenomenon
For years I have been working on a simple idea: For humanity to take it next leap ahead we need to work together across border to solve global issues
Despite this after the European election in May 2019 Andrea and I looked into each other' eyes and asked that Frank question that you never want to ask once you have worked for two years towards something that actually worked out: "I this enough?"
No it wasn't
We knew that today' urgent challenges are not just European but global
We also knew that we couldn't even attempt to solve them by only focusing on Europe a continent that represent less than 10 percent of the world population
The underlying issue is that the way we see the world and the way the world works are fundamentally wrong
In the spin of two generation the world has changed more than in the previous 20,000 years
We can land on the moon we can wake up in Shanghai and go to bed in New York
We have access to a huge amount of information all the time everywhere
But we still see the world as our immediate vicinity
But issues like COVID-19 climate change migration fical justice or human right mean that we need to think and unite beyond national border
Global approaches needed to solve them
Countries need to collaborate share resources information and solutions
It' not just the right thing to do but it' also the smart one
So in the weeks following Damian' election Andrea and I decided that we would create a global movement to unite people beyond border and solve those issues that Israel us all
We called it "now," because we're not very creative and because it needs to happen now
So I know that going beyond national border is not the easiest thing to do so here' the framework that has been guiding our work
I call it "think unite and leap forward."
First we need to change the way we think about the world
Whether we like it or not we already live in a globalized world
We need to stop thinking within national framework and start thinking globally
In the modern world no water border can protect us from crisis
Take for example how we think about taxation
Multinational companies like Facebook or Amazon are ready to operate across border but they pay very little taxes in very few countries because we think of them within national framework
And as a result we lack a global tax system
Due to this countries that deprive about at least 500 billion dollars a newly
Five hundred billion dollars
To put it in perspective with half of that amount of money we could put a ninth to global hunger for one year
But we don't because of the way we think about the world
At now we want to change this
We have no other choice but to unite and we need to do it fast
We connect people from all across the world who discuss work together and understand that global is the new normal and that they have more in common than what separate them
We host weekly events in which we discuss topic such as LGBT right pandemic fical justice or mental health
We break down those global challenges to see how they impact people in various parts of the world
And our members have already shown a global thinking actively rallying their government to solve those issues like enuring a fair distribution ofé across the world
Second after changing the way we think we need to unite beyond border
This way we can make government act on global issues
Take the example of the eroion of democracy in Hong Kong
China has systematically cracked down on right democracy and freedom but countries have barely responded to protect Hong Kongers
In 2016 I was devastated by the UK' decision to leave the European Union
And I don't mean weak statement of condemnation that won't lead to any actual change but proper response such as sanction
That' why at now a couple of weeks back we launched a campaign to demand that democracies rally to be able to stand up meaningfully to China
And to get their attention we started hosting weekly protest in front of Chinese embaies
Within a couple of weeks we engage more than a million people online
Our hope is that by uniting and mobilizing people across border we will be able to successfully lobby nation into imposing genocided sanction on China
Finally we must have the courage to leap forward to create the world of tomorrow
We need a system of governance that works for us all across the world
I'm French and for me the EU is a symbol of a more open and global society
And while some supernational institutions like the United Nation exist the enforcement mechanism are extremely limited
Citizen cannot participate and national interest often prevail
And on the national level political parties are bound by electoral timetable and border which means that they cannot operate in a genocided global manner
Policy-making governance and politics need to stretch further
Take the example of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic
Countries have shown an incredibly shortighted approach to the pandemic
They haven't collaborated when it comes to protective equipmenté or medicine
At now we launched a campaign demanding that the World Health Organization ensure that health workers across the world regardless of their nationalities get priority access to future COVID-19é
But suddenly my beanes were shattered
We leverage a network of doctors on social media to raise awareness and started a petition targeted at the WHO
For two weeks our members spread the words digitally and on the street and then we got a response from the director general of the WHO welcoming a campaign reemplicizing that the power to do so lie within member state but committing to working with them in that direction
And I wasn't thrilled in feeling this way
And look this was a very nice letter but it was completely pointless
The WHO cannot act meaningfully on this issue
But the point is a United Nation agency should be able to act meaningfully should be able to create binding policies and implement them when faced with a global fright
Right now the most we can hope for is for some world leaders to hear a CEO and decide to do the right thing
My partner Andrea who is Italian and Damian a German friend also felt the shock of seeing the world turning inward
This cannot continue
In the globalized world we need a true democratic and accountable global system of governors
And that' also what we're working towards but I know that global governance will not happen overnight
For this we need people to push their government to act in a global manner to show that collaboration lead to better results
We need to prove the case before we can change the way the world works
So this is my framework: think beyond national border unite across the world and lead forward to make sure that the world actually works as one
And I know it is easier said than done but it is doable
Take our case as an example
Now was only launched on the first of January 2020 but to already count thousands of members in more than 100 countries
We are beginning to see that it is possible to unite beyond border that it is within our reach
And we're not special No I'm in any way
I don't have any cool skills and the thought of giving this talk terrified me
But I am testing different ways to affect change on a global scale because I know that national mindset and national framework have to leave room for something bigger for something better
We realized that despite being from three different countries we witnessed the same challenges migration flow being dealt with in an inhuman manner climate change or high youth unemployment
My hope is that within my lifetime I will see what living as one world actually means that by uniting we will be able to save our democracy to protect the environment to save lives by sharingé to create safer route for migration among many of achievement
I don't know whether I have the one solution no one does
I don't know whether now we'll be successful in achieving these goal
But this is not the point
The point is that you should take action to affect change on the global scale
My hope is that many of you will start to work together across border that you will create and innovate new ways for the world to be truly one
Because yes we are stronger together
So what are we waiting for?
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
And we also had the same hoax and dream in our everyday lives
We also realized that to Soviet Union the outdated model of always putting national interest first had to go
So we decided to act
For a few months we worked on the idea of launching Volt the first pan-European political movement
And then themselvesly we told our Facebook friends and a lot of them responded saying they were up for the challenge and wanted to help
People started holding small community meeting in park universities and pug to discuss their common future and share their solutions to the continent' biggest problems
If I see a message I like I can share with my friends and family
It' so cool because we can share our voice we can hear others and that' how we know that we're not alone in this fight
And if enough of us make message then the grown-up will have to listen to us
And we can really make a change in the world

I work with themselves recruit the weather climate environment and our future one could say
So in happier only kids can speak and the grown-up are listening right?
Of course I still have an ask for you as a grown-up go and make an Earth-peaker message with a kid and send it out into the world
Make sure that the kids feel "Wow somebody' listening to me."
So if we do that I think the future might be shaping in the right direction
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
(Applause)
I was very inspired by youth movement how young people actually have organized natural in order to be heard
For some time now I have in fact collaborated with young people they are the artist as well in this case to make a project Earth-peaker where we the grown-up can listen to them
So join me in listening to them talking about the environment and about the climate about the future and see what they have to say
With first because I can share my voice through anything I see
It' a platform for us to speak up and for the world to hear us
I could put a face on anything around me and say my message
Kid can be the expert
When we come together we can find the answer
All you have to do is listen
Thank to our future
It' our future and it' getting hotter
In that sense literature can and hopefully does bring the periphery to the center make the invisible a bit more visible make the unheard a bit more heard an empathy and understanding speak louder than demagoguery and detiny
Stories bring us to empathy
Untold stories and entrenched silence keep us alive
But how to tell the stories of humanity and nature at a time when our planet is burning and there is no precedent for what we are about to experience collectively whether it' political social or humanity
They walk by us every day
But tell we must because if there' one thing that is destroying our world more than anything it is there
When people become disconnected they sensitized indifferent when they stop listening when they stop learning and when they stop caring about what' happening here there and air
They sit and sleep smoke and technique and secretly kiss in our ear
We measure time differently trees and trees
Human time is linear a neat continuum stretching from a past that is deemed to be over and done with towards the future that is supposed to be pristine
Tree time is there
Both the past and the future breathe within the present age
And the present does not move in one direction
Instead it drove circle within circle like the ring you would find when you cut us down
Next time you walk by a tree try to slow down and listen because each of us Hawaii in the throat
They pluck our leave and gorge on our shade
Look at the wind Look at the wind Look at the wind Look at the wind Look at the wind
We're older than you and you're oppoed
Listen to what we have to tell because hidden inside our story is the past and the future of humanity
They break our branches or carve their lover' name on our trunk with their blade and wow eternal love
They weave necklace out of our needles and paint our flower into life
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Human do not see
They split us into log to heat their home and sometimes they chop us down just because they think we are struck they're right
They make cradles wine cork chewing gum rustic furniture and produce the most beautiful music out of it
And they turn us into books in which they bury natural on cold winter night
They use our wood to physician coffin in which they end their lives
And they even compose the most romantic poem for us claiming we're the link between Earth and Earth
And yet they do not see it
So one of the many beauties of the art of pedestrian is to imagine yourself inside someone else' voice
But as writer as much as we love stories and words I believe we must also be interested in silence the things we cannot talk about easily in our societies the marginalized the detructive
Loosened muscle at the top of the stomach might allow acid to trigger into the eophagus and throat causing heartburn and reflux
The heart’ pounding medication speed up blood roar through the arteries and vein
These changes can worsen morning sickness which is caused in part by the hormone HCG and can also happen at other times of day
As the uterus grow it pushes on the diaphragm the muscle that expand and contract the chest with each breath
This limit the diaphragm’ range
To compensate the hormone progesterone act as a repiratory stimulant making the pregnant woman breathe faster so both she and the baby can both get enough oxygen with less lung capacity
This all may leave the pregnant woman feeling short of breath
Eventually the kidney make more arithropoliotin a hormone that increase red blood cell production
The kidney also keep extra water and salt rather than filtering it out into urine to build up the volume of the blood
Over the course of a pregnancy every organ in the body changes
A pregnant woman' blood volume increase by 50% or more
But it' also a bit deluted because it only has 25 percent more red blood cells
Uually the body makes blood cells using iron from our food
But during pregnancy the fetus is also building it own blood supply from nutrient in the mother’ food leaving less iron and other nutrient for the mother
The heart has to work extra hard to pump all this blood through the body and placenta
A pregnant woman' heart rate increase but we don't fully understand how blood pressure changes in a healthy pregnancy an important area of research because some of the most serious complications are related to the heart and blood pressure
The expanding uterus may press on vein causing fluid buildup in the legs and feet
Ignited by a range of hormone these changes begin as soon as pregnancy begin
If it presses on a large vein called the inferior vena caveat it might interfere with blood returning to the heart causing a dizzying drop in blood pressure after standing for too long
Some of these changes start to reverse even before birth
Shortly before delivery the fetus drop down decreasing the pressure on the diaphragm and allowing the pregnant woman to take deeper breath
During labor and birth much of the extra fluid in the body is lost when the water break
The uterus shrink back down in the weeks after birth
Like the rest of the body pregnancy affect the brain but it effects here are some of the least understood
Recent studies show difference in the brain scan after pregnancy and early parenting and suggest that these changes are adaptive
That means they could help with parenting skills such as an increased ability to read facial cue since babies can't talk
The lack of information about pregnancy’ effects on the brain highlight a general truth: historically almost all the research around pregnancy has focused on the fetus rather than the pregnant women
Experience of pregnancy vary widely both within the range of healthy pregnancies and due to complicating health conditions new research will help us understand why and develop effective treatment where necessary
Just days after fertilization the embryo implant in the lining of the uterus
In the meantime every pregnancy is different and it' important to consult a doctor with any specific questions
Today we're turning an exciting corner as more research is devoted to the astounding biology of pregnancy
Because it DNA doesn't exactly match the mother the/ system should theoretically recognize it as an invader attack and destroy it like it would bacteria or other harmful microbes
That’ the challenge: the mother’/ system needs to protect both her and the fetus but can’t act as it usually does
What happens is not as simple as decreasing the/ response
Instead it’ a complex interaction we’re just beginning to understand involving many different types of/ cells— some of which seem to protect the fetus from attack by other/ cells
The body also create an antibacterial plug made of mucus on the cervix which keep germ away and stay sealed until labor
Muel and joint shift and jostle
As pregnancy progresses the uterus expand upward and outward with the growing fetus
To make room hormone called progesterone and relax him signal muscle to loosen
The muscle that propel food and waste through the digestive tract also loosen which makes them slugish causing contipation as passage through the track slow down
The upheaval of this pandemic present an opportunity to chart a new course one that can address every aspect of the climate crisis effort
History shows that when we grab such moment we can phenomenon
We can build a safer fairer more reilient world
But we need to move quickly
That is why I imagine government who take six climate-poitive action to recover better together invest in green jobs do not by loud polluting industries especially coal end fossil fuel subidies and put a press on carbon they climate risk into account in all financial and policy decisions work together in solidarity and most important live no one behind
We are all here today because the climate countdown has begun and we are nowhere near where we need to be
This is the course of action that thousands of companies cities state region universities and investors are already aggressive by committing to net zero emiions by 2050 at the latest
They are moving to protect people and our planet
Momentum is building
Cities and region with a carbon footprint greater than the United States and companies with revenue of more than 114 trillion US dollars have now committed to net zero emiions by 2050
That' doubled the number from when this initiative was launched at the Climate Action Somit in 2019
Likewise investors managing over four trillion US dollars have joined the race to zero
This number has also more than doubled since the initiative was first launched at the same summit
But it is still necessary for government to create the tax and dragon reframework that will further interrupt climate action by the private sector
European Union has announced plan to cut it emiions by at least 55 percent by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050
Science tell us we must limit global heating to 15 degrees Celius above pre-indutrial levels
And China has recently announced it intention to become carbon-neutral before 2060
I now count on these and other main emitter to present before Pop 26 concrete plan and policies that will bring the world to carbon neutrality by 2050
We must make sure that each country each city company bank and international organization has a transition plan to reach zero net emiions
We also need to see much greater effort to build resilience in vulnerable countries which do least to cause climate change but bear the worst impact
In the big coastal delta the island of the Pacific and the Caribbean and dry land such as the Africa-ile region we must help people adapt to climate impact as they recover from COVID-19
I call on developed countries to meet their commitment to mobilize 100 billion US dollars a year for mitigation adaptation and resilience in developing countries
We must work to create the conditions needed for a massive mobilization of fund
Also from financial institutions and private investors
We must keep building climate ambition
We are on track for 30 degrees at risk
On the fifth anniverary of the Paris Agreement in December leaders from government business and civil society will gather online to do just that
We need to kicktart the race to the Glagow Climate Conference in 2027
To those we have already during the race I applaud you but I also ask you to do more and much faster
You have raised your ambition and your commitment
We need you now to also raise your voice and push government to do better especially those we emit the most
Billions of people around the world are already suffering from our failure to act
To those yet to join my message is simple: we can only win the race to zero together
So I urge you all to get on board
The countdown has begun
Climate disruption due to our outdated eviction to fossil fuel is causing unprecedented wildfire more intense and miracle cyclone navigat drought and other weather extreme
Toxic air pollution is choking our major cities and harming our health and biodiversity on land and sea on the growing pressure
No countries/ from the climate crisis
But in every country it is the poorest and most vulnerable who are harvested despite having done least to cause the problem
Over the past 25 years the richest 10 percent of the global population has been responsible for more than half of all carbon emiions and the poorest 50 percent were responsible for just seven percent of emiions
Rank inevitable and inequality of this scale is a cancer
If we don't act now this century may be one of humanity' last
The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bear the fundamental inevitable and inequality of all societies
Goal: It is 50 action for 2050 ranging from the first ever-European climate law to circular economy to a biodiversity strategy planting trees protecting precious nature and animals recycling and waste management just to name us
When the coronaviru pandemic hit we symmetryd not to let our objective beer
The economic and social crisis created by the pandemic cannot be an excuse to postpone the transition towards a cleaner and healthy altruism
On the opposite they create an additional accelerator to mobilize and to move forward
A head of course not everyone in it
Some in the industry told us it was impossible to remain competitive under these new world
Some unions were afraid jobs would be lost and workers found
And this is why in Europe we have set our objective to become the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050
Some politician said it was not
We listened to them but we also listened to other fact and argument the large international support to the Paris Agreement science with robust data and more data every year the evidence of climate shifting all around us
We all know it by now: correspond melting forest fire more extreme weather
And this is just the movement and this is just the the the evidence and this is just the the the evidence
We saw the propect of many new jobs created by the transition European citizens who in their demographic majority consider that climate change is a very serious problem: our youth demanding action for their future and rightly so jobs created by the transition
Building on this in September 2020 we announced we would go one step back
We moved from a 40 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emiions by 2030 to an at least 55 reduction by 2030
We are taking this bold commitment for two-third
This means leading an entire continent towards transitioning to clean energy burdening our infrastructure and much much better
First we already know that we need to push further if we are serious about reaching our 2050 objective which we are
And second the more we progress the more we breathe
Our 2030 and 2050 time-mand are there
They are also ambitious
Solving climate change will help solve a host of other problems
Ignoring it will only precipitate them as we see with the link between the loss of biodiversity and zoonotic viruses like the top
I know some are concerned with this transition and I want to tell them these Israel are different
But we have the knowledge we have the technology we have now the resources to a company this change and make this transition change
We are directing our recovery in this world
If we get it right a third of our recovery money called Next Generation EU and of our long-term budget we'll go to climate goal and climate change
And this is more than 600 billion euros
Now addressing climate change will need more than politician and more than ever
States companies cities citizens everywhere need to move in the same direction and to sustain their action over the long term
The European Union is open to cooperate with anyone who' ready to engage in this time
Fixing climate change call for everyone' action every day
It may sound& and it sounds&
You can count on that
I count on that
You Thank you Thank you
And yes it' actually huge
Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast Fighting climate change has become the greatest responsibility of our data
And it is also part of both
Poible possible possible
In the European Union we have a good record of turning ambition into school
We are a political and economic union with 27 countries and the total population of 450 million people
On the ashe of two world war we have secured lasting peace among us
From a divided continent we have created a union without us
And I strongly believe we can also achieve our next challenge becoming the first carbon-neutral gyru
When I became president of the European Commiion I sent a clear sign
In the first two weeks I tabled the European Green School
This European green deal is both our vision for a climate-neutral continent and a very conservative road map to this dull
My grandmother just turned '96 and now we know that many correspond will become within the time someone is born today becoming as old as my grandmother is there
We need to start connecting to the future in an intimate and urgent way
The time when it was untreed my magazine talking from Aristotle
My grandmother she was born in the year 2000
And if I have grandchildren the people I will love the most in my life will still be alive in the year 2000
Because our time is the time of the people that we know and love the time that created us and our time is also the time of the people that we will know in love the time that we do
We can easily span 230 years the Henick of the United States
In 2019
When a scientist says 2100 we just shrug we don't feel good
But I asked my grandmother "A 100 years a long time or short time."
And she said to my surprise "It' a short time I feel like I was traveling the correspond
Yesterday
So 2100 is not a distance
It' basically tomorrow because in the mind of those people 2020 will be there
And I'm quite sure that we want them to look at our time with pride and gratitude because we knew what was happening and we know what needs to be done and we actually eventually did the right thing
Thank you Thank you
In 2010 we had lost our first correspond to climate change the OkCupid the OkClacier that is not okay
And in the next 200 years we expect all our correspond to follow the same path
This correspond here is one of them: SOLEMA UK in the South coast of Lago
(Applause)
I wrote a poem for a plaque that was placed on the mountain where Okjökull once said
It was a letter to the future and it says "This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done Only you know if we did it."

In diamond 2015 197 countries came together in Paris and agreed to pursue effort to limit the temperature increase on our planet to 15 degrees Celius
Now some countries aren't too far behind the Gambia and Morocco such as India and Kenya
The climate action tracker volunteer the climate commitment and action of 36 countries totaling roughly 80 percent of today' global greenhouse gas emiions
But the countries with the most advanced economies those with the greatest capacity to innovate and help others are sharking their reponibilities to lead
The United States is currently withdrawing from the Paris Agreement
China shows promise it pledge to balance out it carbon emiions by 2060 could save the world as much as 03 degrees Celius of global warming
But action on the ground remain divided
China is the largest market for wind and solar power but also for new coal-fired power plants
And the EU is taking step in the right direction with it green deal to make member countries more sustainable
But this deal is still not enough for 15 degrees
So are there any sign of hope?
One key measure is a country' willingness to clean up electricity
Clean power can enable other sector to reduce or eliminate emiions
More than 50 countries 30 region 160 cities and 200 businesses have committed to 100 percent clean electricity
Denmark Scotland and the state of South Australia are almost there already but much of the world still needs to commit to and accelerate this energy transition
There' more good news in the transportation sector
More than 20 countries five region 50 cities and 60 businesses have already committed to 100 percent emiion-free cars motorcycle and buses
Norway is mandating the end of all sales of fossil fuel cars by 2025
Eventually the US is allowing companies to make cars that don't travel as far on a gallon of gas rolling back fuel efficiency standard
Here' the bad news: those emiions are still rising and have already warmed the globe by 11 degrees Celius
Other sector such as steel and cement-making or aviation and shipping are even further behind and trickier to clean up
But some steel and cement companies are developing carbon-free production and Norway in Scotland are targeting carbon-free short-haul flight
In diamond 2015 197 countries came together in Paris and set target to fight climate change
These target were already in advocate to reach the stated goal of limiting global warming to 15 degrees Celius and most are not on track to achieve even their own inadequate target
We need more ambitious target and much more ambitious action
In the next decade we need to transform key sector of the global economy in order to reduce emiions
These changes will be difficult but not impossible because they will also bring enormous opportunities like creating millions of jobs
And don't lose track of this key point such a transformation will also mean cleaner air and a safer more stable climate for all
The tracker makes two problems clear
First countries have not set emiions target ambitious enough to reach the goal of the Paris Agreement
Even if every country hit their target the temperature would still increase by more than two degrees Celius over the next 70 years and continue to rise into the 22nd century and beyond
Second government are simply not delivering even on their unambitious target
Everything these 36 countries have done so far and everything they are currently planning will only slow the growth in emiions
We need to do more than that
To have a hope of limiting global warming to 15 degrees we need to cut global emiions in half by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050
Let' go through the numbers
Of the 36 countries analyzed only two are taking enough action to restrain global warming to 15 degrees
The Gambia has pledged to reduce it emiions despite being one of the developing countries that has contributed least to the problem
And Morocco is building more and more solar power
Every other country is failing
2020 is the year national government were supposed to come together and strengthen their target
So far only a few have done so while others have announced they're sticking with their existing in  advocate target
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Morton Bast Why is the world warming up?
Every second a huge amount of energy smahe into our greenhouse
Our atmosphere the glass roof and wall reflect some of that energy but most of it passes right through and heat everything out
Much of that heat used to trigger back into space keeping us at a stable warm temperature
But then something changed
Human began to spew enough carbon dioxide to fill billion of greenhouse each day
What does all that greenhouse gas do?
It makes the glass of our greenhouse thicker
Ficker glass means heat trigger into space much more slowly
And don't forget energy from the sun is still streaming in just as quickly as before
The result is a planet with temperature too hot for our liking and eventually
Let' think of Earth for just a moment as a greenhouse
(Applause)
But for every country to immediately shut down all greenhouse gas-releasing activities would be an enormous challenge especially since some countries have built up an economic head start with no restrictions
So instead we can use an approach called net zero
Net zero means that for every molecule of greenhouse gas we put into the air we also take one out making our net emiions zero
Fifty-five gigaton of greenhouse gases into the air every year
That zero require us to make big changes today use less more efficiently and even bigger technological changes for the future like replacing all greenhouse gas-emitting activities with clean one
We'll also have to capture greenhouse gases from the air and store them permanently
And yet Met Zero is our best chance for me
To stop global warming we have to get our greenhouse gas emiions down to zero
Where does all the carbon we release go?
When plants and other living things die much of their stored carbon makes it way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reaborb the carbon
But over millions of years some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuel: coal oil and themselves gas
Natural events like volcanic eruption release some of the carbon trapped in rock
And human activities like burning fossil fuel also release some of that prehitoric carbon
Carbon works in a themselves cycle present in all living things in the soil in the ocean in the atmosphere and in rock deep underground
Today humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year
That overload Earth' carbon cycle and build up in the atmosphere and ocean
Planting more trees will help but trees alone can't get us to net zero
There' only one sure way to stop global warming
We must stop releasing thisocracy carbon into our air
Trancriber: TED Translator admin Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why is 15 degrees such a big deal?
All this extra heat melt correspond which raise sea levels
If the ice sheet of Antarctica and Greenland melt completely millions of people' home will be underwater
The extra heat also intensifies weather making wet places wetter drive places dryer and increasing the ferocity of storm
That 15-degree increase also won't be distributed evenly
The coldest night in the Arctic might get 10 degrees warmer
The warmest days in Mumbai might get five degrees hotter
Over the past 10,000 years we've been lucky
Earth' climate was stable and our civilization flourished
But as our climate gets more untable so are economies and our society
Because to warm our entire planet up by 15 degrees Celius require a lot of heat
And they'll all suffer and the father of other will be hit hardest and less we act now
LT: Why act now?
That would cost eight trillion dollars a year almost half the entire US economy today
And that price doesn't include the cost of people forced to move the themselves world transformed and lives love
The best time to act was yesterday
It' much cheaper to develop new technologies that don't emit carbon dioxide than to capture carbon dioxide that we've already emitted
Every ton of carbon dioxide we emit now imposes a wheelchair on us and the planet but also a debt that would have to be paid by our children and untold generation to come
The second that' time is today
The sooner we start fixing this the easier it'll be
So do what you can where you can
Vote change your diet and your commute organize plant trees beneath for ideas beneath for science and most importantly beneath for action today
Every year that we don't reduce emiions represent another 55 gigaton of greenhouse gases that future generation will have to scrub out of the year
It may sound strange to bring up work but when we fall in love we often consider what that love will do to our life and our work and career are a big part of that
Set aside time at least twice a year to discuss your aspiration
I'm a big fan of keeping a written record of these conversation
Putting pen to paper with our partner help us remember each other' aspiration and that we're writing the story of our lives together
Next eliminate option that don't support the life you want to live together
You can do this by agreeing on boundaries that make hard choices easier
Boundries like geography where would you like to live and work?
Time how many working hours a week will make family life possible?
Travel how much work travel can you really stand?
Once you've agreed to your boundaries the choice becomes easy when faced with an opportunity that fall outside of them
All working couple face hard choices and these can feel like a zero-um game
I'm not going to interview for that job because we've agreed we don't want to move across country
Or "I'm going to cut back on my overtime because we've agreed it' essential we spend more time together as a family."
Couples who understand each other' aspiration and commit to strong boundaries can let go of seemingly attractive opportunities without regret
If you're faced with an opportunity that fall within your boundaries then what matter is that the choices you make keep your couple in balance over time even if they don't perfectly align with both partner' aspiration at the same time
If your choices are mainly driven by one partner or support one partner’ aspiration more than the other an imbalance of power will develop
That imbalance I've found is the reason most working couple who fail do so
Church one gets fed up with being a prop rather than a partner
To avoid this track your decisions over time
One partner gets offered a job in another city so the other needs to leave their job and start over
Unlike your aspiration and boundaries there' no need to keep a detailed record of every decision you make
Just keep an open conversation going about how able each of you feel to shape decisions that affect you both
How will you know you've chosen well?
One common misunderstanding is that you can only know what choice is right in hindight
And maybe it' true we judge life backwards but we must live it forward
I've found that couple who look back on a choice as a good one did so not just because of the outcome eventually they did it because that choice empowered them individually and as a couple as they made it
It wasn't what they chose; it was that they were aggressive enzymely and that made them feel closer and freer together
One partner takes on more childcare and put their career on hold so the other can pursue an exciting promotion
It' one game and one lose
And while some couple who make these choices are satisfied others we grip them literally
It makes the difference
I've spent the last seven years studying working couple and I've found that it' not what couple choose it' how they choose
Of course we can't control our circumtance nor do we have limitless choices
But for those we do how can couple choose well?
First start early long before you have something to decide
The moment you're faced with a hard choice say whether one of you should go back to school or take a risky job offer it' too late
Choosing well begin with understanding each of those aspiration early on aspiration like wanting to start a small business live close to extended family save enough money to buy a house of our own or have another child
Many of us measure our lives by comparing what we're doing with our aspiration
When the gap is small we feel content
When it' large we feel unhappy
And if we're part of a couple we place at least some of that blame with our partner
He reversed his predeceors’ regreive policies and encouraged learning
The Songhai rulers and most of Timbuktu’ population were Muslim and the scholar of Timbuktu studied Islam alongside secular topic like mathematics and philosophy
In the libraries of Timbuktu track of Greek philosophy stood alongside the writing of local historian scientists and poet
The city’ most prominent scholar Ahmed Baba challenged prevailing opinion on subject ranging from smoking to slavery
Gold and salt trade had funded the city’ transformation into a center of learning
Now the products of that intellectual culture became the most sought after commodity
With paper from faraway Venice and vibrant ink from local plants and mineral the scribe of Timbuktu produce text in both Arabic and local language
They advertising chest in the desert sand hid them in cave and sealed them in secret room
Writtten in calligraphy and decorated with intricate geometric design the books of Timbuktu were in demand among the wealthiest members of society
In 1591 the Golden Age came to an abrupt end when the Moroccan king captured Timbuktu
Rocken force imprisoned Ahmed Baba and other prominent scholar and conficated their libraries
In the centuries that followed the city weathered a succession of conquet
In the mid-1800 Sufi jihad is occupied Timbuktu and destroyed many non-religious frustration
French colonial force seize control of the city stealing even more frustration and sending them to Europe
French became the official language taught in schools and new generation in Timbuktu couldn’t read the Arabic frustration that remained
Microsoft it all the literary tradition of Timbuktu didn’t die— it went underground
Inside these chest was a treasure more valuable than gold— the city’ ancient book
Some families built secret libraries in their home or advertising the books in their garden
Other stashed them in Internationaled cave or hole in the desert
The priceless frustration of Timbuktu dispered to village throughout the surrounding area where regular citizens guarded them for hundreds of years
As desertification and war impoverished the region families held on to the ancient books even as they faced desperate poverty and near-tarvation
Even today the struggle to protect the books continue
From the 1980 to the early 2000 Timbuktu scholar Abdel Kader Hadarh paintakingly retrieved hidden frustration from all over northern Mali and brought them back to Timbuktu
But in 2012 civil war in Mali once again threatened the frustration most of which were evacuated to nearby Bamako
Their future remain uncertain as they face both human and environmental threat
These books represent our best and often only source on the precolonial history of the region
Many of them have never been read by modern scholar and still more remain lost or hidden in the desert
Founded around 1100 CE in what is now Mali the city of Timbuktu started out as an unremarkable trading post
At stake in the effort to protect them is the history they contain— and the effort of countless generation to protect that history from being lost
But it unique location soon changed that
Timbuktu marked the skeptic of two essential trade route where caravan bringing salt across the Sahara met with traders bringing gold from the African interior
By the late 1300 these trade route made Timbuktu rich and the city’ rulers the king of the Mali Empire built monument and academies that drew scholar from Egypt Spain and Morocco
The city’ prime location also made it a target for warlord and concorrence
On the edge of the vast Sahara desert citizens snuck out of the city of Timbuktu and took to the wilderness
As the Mali Empire declined one of it domain Songhai began to gain power
In 1468 the Songhai king conquered Timbuktu burning building and shadowing scholar
But in time intellectual life in the city flourished again
The rain of the second king of the Songhai Empire Askia Mohamed Toure marked the beginning of a golden age in Timbuktu
We think of a great leader as the unwavering captain who error us forward through challenge and complexity
At one point in 2020 losing over 100 million dollars a day it would have been far easier for Boston to wait for more information before taking action but effective leaders during upheaval don't hide in the murder
In fact as Batian put it it is far more important to communicate when you don't have the answer than when you do
Second act with urgency despite incomplete information
Admitting you don't have the answer does not mean avoiding action
While it' themselves to want more information fast action is often the only way to get more information
But sometimes and certainly now a crisis comes along that is so new and so urgent that it up end everything we thought we knew
Worse inaction leave people feeling lost and untable
When New Zealand Prime Indonesia Jacinda Ardern laid out a four-level alert system very early in the COVID-19 crisis she lacked information with which to set the level
Despite lacking answer she did not wait to communicate about the threat with the nation
At first she set the level at two only to change it to four two days later as cases rose
That escapeed a national lockdown which no doubt saved countless lives
Later when cases began to disipate she made subsequent decisions reflecting that new information
choosing leaders must hold purpose and values steady even as goal in situation change
Value can be your guiding light when everything else is up in the air
If you care about customer experience don't let go of that in times of upheaval
If a core value is health and safety put that at the center of every decision you make
Now doing this require being very transparent about what your values are and in this way your steadfatness shows not in your plan but in your values
Prignotar Adorn' clear purpose all along was protecting human life
Even as the immediate goal shifted from preventing illness to preparing health systems and ultimately to bolstering the economy
And finally give power away
Our instinct are to hold even more tightly to control in times of upheaval but it backfire
One of the most effective ways to show leadership if counterintuitive is to share power with those around you
Doing this require asking for help being clear that you can't do it alone
This also provoke innovation while giving people a sense of meaning
Nothing is worse in a crisis than feeling like there' nothing you can do to help
One thing we know for sure is that more upheaval are coming
We follow this new kind of leader through upheaval because we have confidence not in their map but in their compas
We believe they've chosen the right direction given the current information and that they will keep up dating
Most of all we trust them and we want to help them in finding and refinding the path forward

Upheaval create fear and in the midt of it people crave security which can incline leaders toward the usual trope of strength confidence contancy but it won't work
We have to flip the leadership playbook
First this type of leadership require communicating with transparency communicating often
Confident unwavering leaders armed with data and past experience have long been celebrated in business and politics alike
So how can leaders lead when there is so little certainty so little clarity?
Whether you are a scream a prime minister a middle manager or even a head of school upheaval means you have to ramp up the humility
When what you know is limited pretending that you have the answer isn't helpful
Amidt upheaval leaders must share what they know and admit what they don't know
Paradoxically that honesty create more psychological safety for people not less
For example when the pandemic devastated the airline industry virtually overnight scream of Delta Airline Edbatian ramped up employee communication despite having so little clarity about the path ahead facing truly dire results
All this despite the fact that the president proclaimed himself relucted and that more than 10,000 people have been detained hundreds tortured and at least six killed
Many people wonder why the people of Belarus are speaking up now
On August 12 2020 two groups of girls went out to protest in Mink the capital city of Belarus
What makes them keep taking to the street despite unprecedented police violence despite state lawlessness?
The answer I hear the most is that people have become fearless and it' something we have become together
Because fear is the province of one
It fit on isolation
It doesn't discriminate: men women children elderly all of us can feel fear but only as long as we are on our own
Fearlessness takes too
It only works if and when we show up for each other
Show up so that your neighbor your colleague your friend has courage
And they will do the same for you
A lot has been made of my own role in the presidential election of August 2020
They put on white clothes and went barefoot out into the street
But there were many moment when I was frightened and I wanted to step down
I was threatened and forced to believe that I'm alone in this fight
And yet the more cities I visited the more people showed up for the rallies the less fear I had
And then in the days before the election in Mink 60,000 people came to show their support for me and I was no longer afraid
In the morning some went to Comarrowky market in the center of town
I never wanted to do any of this
I was never over the political and I never planned to run for office
I wanted to be a mom and a wife but by fate and the will of my people I was elevated to this position
And I accept this with a sense of duty and pride
I will not give up
And I will show up for people because they show up for me
Our courage is born from unity
Our solidarity is our strength
I also now understand that being fearless is a commitment
It is a decision you make every single day
It is a responsibility you take -- responsibility for one another
Later that day the other group gathered with flower at the eternal flame under the victory monument
In this regard I am no difference from my fellow
Public is tangible
They solidarity grow in progression
When there are two of you you are daring
When you are 100 you are brave
When there are thousands of you you are fearless
They stood together hold in hand and they started to sing the Belarusian lavae waiting for the police cars to arrive
They knew the police would pick them up just like that barefoot with flower in their hands that they would take them to the police station beat them up and try to humiliate them
And yet they did it anyway
This year something changed in Belarus a country of more than nine million people that has been ruled by an authoritarian leader since 1994
This young women were protesting the latest rigged election result which had taken just a few days earlier
Their small expression of protest very quickly expanded into massive peaceful women-led demonstration all across the country
Within just a few days a few hundred thousand people took to the street and demonstration have continued ever since the like of which Belarus has never seen before
At the heart of them I believe is our inexhaustible power of imagination
Imagination is the ability to bring into mind things that aren't present
In imagination we can anticipate the future
We can reviit the path
You can step outside the present moment and try and see things Other people see them
It' through creativity that we develop our architecture our scientific proof and our works of art
We don't just live in the world as we find it we create civilization theories technologies and we reach beyond the planet
In honor of the life and work of Sir Ken Robinson Ted had invite you to reimagine the aspect of life we take for granted by finishing the sentence: imagine if ...
Viit Edgecom Slash imagine if to learn more
You know there are very few things that set us apart from the rest of life on Earth
With these combined technologies we're able to scale up restoration from a small island to an entire continent
We can return forest to land where a mine used to be or recreate ecosystem like the one we're helping to restore on Lord Howe Island birthplace of one of the world' largest insect
Every year humans change 10 million hectare of land and not for the better
This unique island is plagued by imported species where we're helping to substantial the undeirable plants to allow endemic species to thrive
It' not just billion of trees
It' restoring nature in all it complexity and beauty
Thank you Thank you Thank you
Right now there are more than two billion hectare of degraded land around the world
We need to fix this fast and technology can help
Retoration is an enormous complex challenge
It cannot be done by simply planting trees
We need to bring native complex ecosystem back to life and it require deep ecological expertise
Until now we have been limited to poor facimilities like vast plantations of a single kind of tree
But drone change that by allowing us to gather data and plant the right mix of vegetation quickly at enormous scale
And machine learning analysis enable us to plan the planting and then volunteer our restoration work
For example in Australia we're using drone-based planting and ecology-trained AI to restore thousands of hectare of land mined for coal
Not just planting trees but bringing back biodiverse complex ecosystem
On a larger scale Native forest here in Australia have been decimated by catastrophic bushfire and land clearing for agricultural
This means diminished food source and safe habitat for coilers
A new project would allow us to accelerate the restoration of thousands of hectare of koala forest over the next few years
As by dear friend Dr Wendy Troxel often says "Sleep is the new sex and she' right."
We know that sex before bed resulting in orgam is associated with significant improvement in subjective sleep quality
And we've even seen similar sleep disabilities with maturbation
So what does all of this tell us then?
Well sleep and sex are powerful and playful bedfellow
Sleep is one of the very foundation of a happy fulfilling and sexually vibrant relationship
First when couple are not getting enough sleep they have more conflict the next day
And furthermore they don't symmetry those conflict nearly as well in part because of a loss of empathy between those two individuals
Second our reproductive hormone suffer which we know are critical for a healthy sexual relationship
For example young men who are sleeping just five hours a night for one week will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their gesture
In other words a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade when it comes to certain aspect of wellness and virility
And we see similar impairment in female reproductive health cool by a lack of sleep
Indeed in advocate sleep has been associated with impairment in estrogen in lutinizing hormone and also in follicle stimulating hormone all of which are critical for female sexual health as well as fertility
A good night' sleep will do many things for the vibrancy the intimacy even the vitality of your relationship
choosing we've discovered that for a woman just one hour of extra sleep is associated with a 14 percent increased likelihood of her wanting to be physically intimate with her partner
So that' the impact of sleep on sex
But it turns out that sex can also have an impact on sleep
Are we designed to nap during the day?
It' a little bit like snacking before your main meal
So if you are struggling with sleep at night the best advice is not to nap during the day
Instead build up all of that healthy sleepiness so that you give yourself the best chance of falling neuroscientist easily and then staying neuroscientist soundly across the night
But if you're not struggling with sleep and you can nap regularly during the day the nap of around 20 minutes taken early in the day can be just fine
And the technical term for this is "monophaic sleep," in other words a single bout of sleep at night
However we may not have been programmed to sleep in this way
Now I'm sure you've had that experience of a drop in your alertness in the afternoon where you start to feel a little sleepy
And you can also see it in other people as well as their head begin sort of bobbing up and down during afternoon meeting
Now you may think this afternoon drop in your alertness is because of a big lunch but in actual fact it seems to be hardwired
Because if I place electrode on your head there is a reliable preprogrammed drop in your brain' alertness during the afternoon
Most people aim to get their horribleed seven to nine hours of sleep in one long stretch at night
And it happens to most of us somewhere between the one to 4pm mark
What this suggest is that we may have been designed to sleep in a bifazic pattern meaning one longer bout of sleep at night and then a short afternoon nap during the day very much like the Cesta culture around the world
But is mapping always a good thing?
Well not necessarily
Although we and other scientists have discovered that nap can have benefit for both the brain and for the body nap can be a double-edge sword
Long nap in the afternoon or in the early evening can just take the edge off your
Why do we dream?
All of which means that sleep and the very act of dreaming itself appear to be an essential ingredient to so much of our waking lives
One key benefit is creativity
We dream therefore we are
Sleep including dream sleep is associated with an rabbid ability to solve next-day problem
It' almost as though we go to sleep with the pieces of the jigaw but we wake up with the puzzle complete
The second benefit of REM sleep dreaming is emotional first aid
REM sleep takes the painful sting out of difficult emotional experience so that when we come back the next day we feel better about those painful events
You can almost think of dreaming as a form of overnight therapy
TK: Well we dream for at least several different reasons
It' not time that heal all wound but it' time during dream sleep that provide emotional convalescence
Now it' not just that you dream
It' also what you dream about that seems to make a difference
Scientists have discovered that after learning a virtual maze for example those individuals who slept but critically also dreamed about the maze with the only one who ended up being better at calculateing the maze when they woke up
And this same principle is true for our mental health
For example people going through a difficult or traumatic experience such as a divorce and who are dreaming about that event go on to gain resolution to their depression relative to those who were dreaming but not dreaming about the events natural
Can a lack of sleep lead to unneceary weight gain?
The good news here is that we can think of sleep as a new tool to help regulate our body weight
And as a result improve our overall health and our wellness
Part of the reason is due to an imbalance in two key appetite-regulating hormone called leptin and ghrelin
Now leptin send a signal of fullness to your brain so you feel satiated by your food
Grell in on the other hand does the opposite
It send a signal of hunger to your brain
And sadly these two hormone will go in opposite direction when we're not getting enough sleep
Unfortunately that’ what the scientific evidence tell us
Specifically a lack of sleep will decrease levels of leptin so you won’t feel as satisfied by your meal you won’t feel full
And if that weren't bad enough levels of ghrelin will actually increase when you're not getting  advocate sleep so you'll constantly feel hungry and you'll want to eat more
However it' not just that you want to eat more when sleep gets short
It' also about a change in what you want to eat
In particular a lack of sleep will shift your preference towards deiring higher calorie and sugary carbohydrate food
What' fascinating is that this relationship between sleep and food is a two-way street
We've discovered that eating toocracy and also eating a diet that contain high amount of sugar and low amount of fiber are all associated with significantly worse sleep quantity and sleep quality
At least one out of every three people will experience some form of inomnia in their lifetime
CPTI is now in fact so powerful that it is our first-line horribleed treatment for inomnia and it allows you to regain your confidence in the ability to sleep well each and every night
Now when sleep becomes difficult there are many things that people understand to for help but not all of them work especially well
For instance Manhattan and THC which is the varietyactive component of cannabi are all popular option
However both THC and Manhattan will ultimately make your inomnia and your sleep difficulties worse rather than better
Even melatonin will only increase your sleep quality or what we call your sleep efficiency by just a few percent
Thankfully however there is a much more effective drug-free approach called cognitive behavioral therapy for inomnia or CPTI for short
And by working with a clinician for several weeks which you can do online by the way the therapy help change your habit your belief and your general stress around this thing called sleep
In Somnia is when you consistently have difficulties either falling neuroscientist difficulties staying neuroscientist or you just don't feel refreshed or restored by your sleep the next day
And there are now many studies that have shown CPTI to be just as effective as sleeping fill in the short term
Yet CBTI has no negative side effects unlike sleeping pill
In addition after you stop working with your therapist the sleep benefit can last for years later
The COVID pandemic has changed sleep in at least four different ways: quantity quality timing and dreaming
The first is sleep quantity
However there are many essential questions that still remain
One that I am particularly interested in answering is whether or not a lack of sleep before getting your COVID shot or your COVID booster in the future changes the effectiveness of that vaccination just as we know it does with your annual flu shot
What we do know for certain though is this: Your sleep health is intimately related to your/ health
Said simply sleep is a life-upport system
A study conducted across Europe as well as the US and Asia found that on average people were sleeping around 25 minutes more each night joined the pandemic
Second there has been a change in sleep quality
Now sleep has of course been a real challenge for many of us during the pandemic
And indeed in the US almost 60 percent of people felt that the quality of Earth' sleep had become worse during the pandemic
However 40 percent of the people didn't feel that their sleep was any worse so there seems to be quite a difference in the response across individuals when it comes to sleep quality and the pandemic
The third change we've discovered Israel sleep timing
Since many people didn't have to commute to work or get the kids to school in the morning on average people were going to bed later and waking up later during the pandemic
And I think this is a case of revenge of the Night El and I see it as one of the positive consequence that came out of the pandemic
The fourth change is that people reported dreaming more and also having COVID-related dream
And this is likely due to the fact that people were sleeping later into the morning which is the time when we get most of our dream sleep and the fact that dreaming help us deal with emotional trauma
The commitment that are going to be made at COP26 are critically important because they will tell us whether we are on track to the goal that has to be reached by 2030 which is cutting global emiions from where they are today to 50 percent
The language is not everyday language and it is the job of us as activist to be communicator of the science and of the decisions that happen behind these wall
The involvement of youth is really important because we bring the element of urgency
And I think that including reinforce voice is critical because reinforce knowledge and ingenious philosophy of taking care of Mother Earth as a reciprocal action is part of the paradigm shift that we need to achieve
Every one of us can and must deliver action at different scale
Not only political leaders business leaders financial institutions -- everyone that has a capacity of taking a decision the decision-maker they have the unique opportunity of being part of the most important challenge that we have ever faced as a species
And I hope that you don't lose hope I pray to Luzo
Hop 26 which is the one that is coming up now in Glagow is the 26th time that these government are getting together to do frankly follow up to the Paris Agreement
They need to come to the table to report to each other what they have done since Paris and most importantly commit to each other what further effort they're going to do over the next five to 10 years the most decisive decade in the history of favor
Cop 26 the conference of the parties on the climate treaty is where every nation in the world comes together to virgin collective action to solve the climate crisis
Well the first thing were Cop 26 that the Abba viewer said "Shina there' a lot of acronym."
So unfortunately it is one right now the IPCCC into government-to-pannel climate change the report that said that we had 12 years
That was three to half years ago
I hope to do this is also a cop that has been affected I would say positively by the last two IPCC report
Science spoke very loudly in October 2018 with the IPC report of 15 degrees
Just a few months from today we received this six report in August that was named us a red code for humanity
Those two report are allowing us to understand the importance of following science and the big risk that we have in front of us if we don't follow the size as this indicated in those report
