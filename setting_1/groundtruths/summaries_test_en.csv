"Gore: If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years  I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love This is the wish I would pick. We're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world, he says."
"Bill Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer, hire all the great scientists, that's only tens of millions. The tough thing is building the pilot reactor  finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location that will actually build the first one of these."
"The nuclear power plant would be its own waste disposal solution. The waste would sit there and burn for 60 years, and then it's done. The company is talking to different people around the world about the possibilities. It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have built them."
TerraPower is working on a plan to emit CO2 into the atmosphere. The project could have a huge impact on the environment. TerraPower is hoping to have a pilot plant in place by 2015. The company is working with a number of other companies on the project.
"BG: The main problem we have here  it's kind of like with AIDS: you make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later. BG: If you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints, then the skeptics say, OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2"
"Climate change expert: We should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive If the tradeoff you get into is, Let's make energy super expensive, then the rich can afford that, he says. The disaster is for that two billion"
"The world puts out 26 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. For each American, it's about 20 tons, for people in poor countries it's less than one ton. We have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero"
"Every year, this number, on average, is going to go up, and so, overall, that will more than double the services delivered per person. Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent. But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons."
"Climate change means many years, crops won't grow, he says. So we need energy miracles, he adds. This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline, he writes. We don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date"
"CNN's John Sutter looks at ways to reduce CO2 emissions. Sutter: We need solutions, either one or several, that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year, Sutter says."
"Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, don't require fuel. But the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. These are intermittent sources, so the climate changes will be terrible for them. Nuclear power also has three big problems."
"TED Talk: If you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy. All the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy. We need lots of companies working on this  hundreds of people."
"Nathan Myhrvold and I are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach. The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium  the one percent, which is the U235  we decided, Let's burn the 99 percent"
CNN's John Defterios looks at how the world can reduce CO2 emissions. He says the first step is to get to an 80 percent reduction in emissions. Defterio: The second step is that we have to make sure that we are using this technology
CNN's John Sutter talks about the power of the human spirit. Sutter: All you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power Sutter says he's changed because of the people who have opened his eyes.
"The God Who Only Knows Four Words is a poem by Persian poet Hafiz. The God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them, saying, 'Come, dance with me'  is a powerful piece of poetry. The words whole and wholesome refer to a person's spirit."
"Aimee O'Mara says her childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute opened doors for her as a child. She says he told her she was such a strong and powerful little girl, I think you're going to break one of those bands O' Mara: It's not just about the words, it's what we believe about people when we name them."
"Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life We are marked, of course, by a challenge, whether physically, emotionally or both Our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity, but preparing them"
"We do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt. We need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability. And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of."
"Aimee Mullins: We can reimagine adversity as something more than just tough times. Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet, Mullins says. Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use."
"I have no idea who he is. I don't remember meeting him, she says of the man who delivered her from the womb. He said he had been making a difference in my life since I was a little girl, she recalls. It's very difficult to think straight"
"Kahneman: Money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions, he says. Kahneman: If people took seriously that finding, it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about."
"Kahneman: People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come, he says. There's just no way of getting it right, he adds."
"There are two selves: an experiencing self and a remembering self. The remembering self is the one that keeps score, and maintains the story of our life. Getting confused between the two is part of the mess about the notion of happiness, he says."
"Researchers asked patients to report on their pain every 60 seconds. One patient had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than the other. The one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it's a bad story. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness, among researchers"
"Psychologist David Frum: What defines a story? Changes, significant moments and endings Frum says most of the moments of our life are ignored by the remembering self. Most of them don't leave a trace, he says. They are lost forever"
"The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. Time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self. This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness, and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness, because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else."
How much do we consume our memories? That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self. Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves. There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply.
Happiness is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life. The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years.
"Happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like, spending time with people we like. We know that money is very important, goals are very important. The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for wellbeing. It is a completely different notion."
"With Pivot, you can drill into a decade. You can jump right into a specific issue. You get the idea that when you navigate over information this way, you're not searching. You're doing something that's actually a little bit different. It changes the way information can be used."
CNN's John Sutter shows how to use information to see trends that would otherwise be invisible. Sutter: The whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary
Pivot is an app that lets users zoom in and out of web pages. It also lets users see their entire browsing history in one place. The idea is that the web can be used to reveal hidden patterns in data. It could also help people extract information from data.
CNN's John Sutter uses a new tool to look at the causes of death in the U.S. Sutter says the data shows that the most common cause of death is death by natural causes. He says the new tool can be used to help people understand the cause of their own deaths.
"As a child, I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds. So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together, and that made sense. I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives."
"With The Abyss, I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic. With Terminator 2, we created the liquid metal dude in that film. And it did, and we created magic again."
"Avatar was meant to push the envelope of visual effects, of CG effects, beyond, with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG, he says. But the envelope pushed back, and he shelved it and made a movie about a big ship that sinks. Secretly, what he wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of Titanic, he adds."
"After the success of Titanic, he said, OK, I'm going to go be a fulltime explorer for a while I was a real science geek, he says. It was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility"
"It was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had, he says. When I say, I'm operating it, my mind is in the vehicle It may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out"
"I learned a lot about science, says Jacques Cousteau. I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing? You're doing it for the task itself, he says."
"Avatar was tremendously exciting. Tremendously challenging. And we became a family, over a fourandhalf year period It completely changed how I do movies. It was more of a fundamental way of doing business, the process itself"
"CNN's John Defterios talks to CNN iReport about his new documentary, Fish in the Sea Defterio: For better or for worse, aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future Failure is an option, but fear is not, he says."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the environmental benefits of fish farms. Sutter: Fish farms pollute, and they're inefficient. He says there's a better way: Farms that restore instead of deplete. If that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious, Sutter says."
"I've known a lot of fish in my life. I've loved only two. I was lying in bed, and I thought: What the hell is a sustainable protein? We're basically a world unto ourselves. That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one, he said."
"There's just too much chicken in the world, he says. I swear to God, after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken It was a beautiful fish: flavorful, textured, meaty, a bestseller on the menu"
"CNN's John Sutter tries a different kind of fish for the first time. This time, the fish is from a farm in southern Spain. The fish was overcooked, but it was still delicious, Sutter says. Sutter: Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked? I can't, but this guy can."
"Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. In 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. They reversed the flow of water. Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in."
Miguel is like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. Miguel is an expert in relationships. He is also an expert on rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants.
"The farm has 600,000 birds on it, more than 250 different species. The system is so healthy, it's totally selfrenewing. The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankston, is what feeds the fish. The fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild."
"The farm is not only a fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary. The flamingos eat the shrimp. The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pinker the belly, the better the system, the owner says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to Miguel, owner of a fish farm in southern Spain. Miguel: The skin acts like a sponge. It's the last defense before anything enters the body. It evolved to soak up impurities Sutter: Our water has no impurities."
"The world needs a radically new conception of agriculture, he says. One billion people will go hungry today, he adds. The food system has determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years. How are you going to feed the world? Can I be honest? I don't love that question"
"An illusionist shows off a trick he uses to teach children about deception. The trick involves holding a knife in your hand and shifting your finger. The illusionist says the trick is very simple, but can teach you a great deal about deception by studying it."
"The magician uses chicanery to trick people into believing he is giving them a placebo. He says the placebo effect is when something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real The trick can be used to trick your friends and neighbors, too."
"If you have capsules, they're more effective than tablets in any form. A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills."
"This is not a Hollywood special effect. This is really my flesh, he says. I'm going to show you what it looks like to go through the skin of a human being And then I'll show you the other side, he adds. And you'll see that it's not as bad as you think"
This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s. I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s. Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it. I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. Thank you very much.
"The Institute for the Future piloted the game with 1,700 players in 2007 and tracked them for the three years since. This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on. Challenge yourself to see how you would survive, says the game's creator."
"Superstruct is a game done with the World Bank Institute. If you complete the game, you will be certified as a Social Innovator, class of 2010. We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks. They came up with 500 creative solutions that you can go online, Google Superstruct, and see."
"Jane McGonigal is a game designer and the creator of the popular Fortnite game. She says the game is a tool to help people solve reallife problems. McGonIGal: We can make any future we can imagine, and we can play any games we want"
"When we're in game worlds, I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves. In real life, when we face failure, we often don't feel that way. We never have those feelings when we're playing games, they just don't exist in games. What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything?"
"There's no unemployment in World of Warcraft; no sitting around, wringing your hands  there's always something specific and important to be done. There are also tons of collaborators. Everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission."
"The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21. For children in the United States, 10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school, from fifth grade to high school graduation."
500 million people in the world spend at least an hour a day playing online games. The game industry is developing consoles that are lowenergy and that work with the wireless phone networks. They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.
"The average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week  kind of a halftime job. Gamers love to be attached to aweinspiring missions to human planetaryscale stories. We know that we are optimized as human beings, to do hard and meaningful work. And gamers are willing to work hard all the time."
"We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments We have to start making the real world work more like a game I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago. It's not, by any means, an optimal situation"
"Before we had awesome game controllers, we had sheep's knuckles. Herodotus says that games, particularly dice games, were invented in the kingdom of Lydia, during a time of famine. On one day, everybody would eat, and the next day everybody would play games."
"DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans, who then led to the Roman Empire, actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians. Scientists have suggested that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true. They played dice games for 18 years, we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years."
"We want to make the future a reality for people We don't want to predict the future, we want to help people get there It's not a game, it's a way of life I'm not trying to make people feel bad. I'm just trying to help them get to the future"

"Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people are triumphs of the scientific method, he says. We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now, he adds. I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it"
"Bob Greene: People wrap themselves in their beliefs, and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free. Greene: I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on. You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not."
"We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to, he says. We've lost faith in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science itself, and there's no reason we shouldn't have. Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence, he adds."
"We're now in an epidemic of fear like one I've never seen and hope never to see again When you get proof, you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down"
"I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous, he says. We need to learn it really soon, he adds. I'm not part of that crowd, but I have to say that I do understand it"
"Paul Offit developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people. It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids in the developing world every year. He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school."
"We didn't have polio in this country yesterday, he says. That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't. Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it. It doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless. The data says it all the time. They darken your urine"
"I love Big Placebo. I'm totally with you. It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine? I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma. We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man. And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks"
"When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science, you end up in a place you don't want to be. Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice, every sprig of parsley, every Brussels sprout has been modified by man. It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop."
"Vitamin A can help millions of people prolong their lives, he says. Some of it worked, and some of it didn't. We can do it in a more precise way, but there are risks, absolutely. It's true, we've got a huge food problem, but this isn't science, he adds."
"In the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now, 70 percent. We don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance. It's not even an idea; it's a process. The idea that we should not allow science to do its job is very deadening."
"This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals. This isn't about Rice Krispies, this is about keeping people alive, he says. We have to have these conversations and we have to think, but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead, we're going to be happy we do It's stuck in the present right now, but we have an amazing opportunity, he adds."
"Among the worst are recent graduates of business school, who lie, cheat, get distracted and produce really lame structures. Among the best are kindergarteners, who produce the tallest structures. Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge."
"Architects and engineers build the tallest freestanding structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape and a marshmallow. Thirtynine inches is the tallest structure I've seen. Architects and engineers understand triangles and selfreinforcing geometrical patterns."
"The challenge was to build the tallest marshmallow in the shortest amount of time. The winner of the challenge received a $10,000 prize. The challenge was designed to teach students how to use digital tools to make better products. It was also a chance for students to test their own ideas of what a good design is."
"Every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it? The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language and a common stance to build the right prototype. And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly."
"Bezos: I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero, he says. I swear. I swear, he adds, I'm not a hero."

"The Congo is a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty. It is also the scene of a violent conflict that has claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War. Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives. They have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict."
"Play is where we learn about the rules of the game. Play is not just child's games, it's a way of life. It's also a way for people to bond and learn from each other. Play can be very serious or very funny. It can also be very silly."
"Fuku, a young female bonobo, is seen playing with water in the Congo jungle. Fuku says play is the key to our capacity to adapt to an increasingly challenging world. In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the time when it is most urgent."

CNN's John Sutter talks about his work with a new type of laser. The laser can be used to project images onto a wall. Sutter: It's a new way to communicate with the public. It's a very exciting time
"The EyeWriter is a device that allows people to draw and communicate using only their eyes. The EyeWriter was created by a group of people who spent two weeks programming the device. The device is free to build and to download, and you can download the software for free."
"TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. He only has use of his eyes. We kicked his bed so that he could see out. And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital. And he drew again for the first time, in front of his family and friends."

"CNN's John Sutter talks about the role of evolution in human evolution. Sutter: For better or worse, and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us Is it just about the past, or is it about the future? he asks. How would you like to be better than you are?"
"We have been here for about 130,000 years. We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago. We carry in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body. The gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria."
"The Big Bang took place 14 billion years ago. The human species emerged in the last 130,000 years. In most of the existence of life in singlecelled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells. Sexual reproduction enters the picture."
"I was trying to preserve the body. I wanted us to live long and healthy lives, he says. I don't want to achieve it through not dying. I want it through living well. I want to live as long as I can, he adds. That's what I want to do."
"Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. At the bottom of the ocean, bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce, if fish were there, sousvide cooked fish."
"The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and it took 13 years. It cost 2.7 billion dollars. Neoevolution is the new evolution that is guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make."
"In 2004, you could have a complete sequence of the human genome for 20,000 dollars. The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves, but induce immunity against other viruses. An experimental vaccine against influenza has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant."
"Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject. Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine? Why not live longer? These will be irresistible."
"Antonelli: Our objects, our environment is starting to talk back to us It's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator That is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there"

Researchers in Seattle used tags to track trash as it moves through the system. The tags were placed on items that people would throw away anyway. The results show that the tags can be used to track objects with much less energy. The project was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.
"The first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain. It started with a question by the mayor of the city, who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space."
"The Digital Water Pavilion is made of water. There are no doors or windows, but when you approach it, it will open up to let you in. The roof also is covered with water. If there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize splashing, you can lower the roof."
"The Flyfire project is a 3D cloud of pixels that can move in space. The pixels are made of water, and then projections are made on them. The project was inspired by the idea of winning a Formula 1 race with a good driver and a good car."
"We've been working with Roberto Bolle, one of today's top ballet dancers. We captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire. It's both 3D scanning in real time and motion capture. So you can reconstruct a whole movement."
"For the first time, we can go from the digital world, from the selforganizing power of networks, to the physical one. This has been digitizing everything, knowledge, and making that accessible through the Internet. But tomorrow it can be, to tackle today's pressing challenges."
Amitai Bhatnagar: I get a lot of people asking me: What do you get for 10 billion pixels? So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for10 billion pixels. Amitai: You can zoom around very simply. You can go to the end of the corridor. Have fun.
"CNN's John Sutter takes a tour of the MoMA in New York. Sutter: You see some fun stuff happening here. But then you really want to go deep. And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here"
"The Power of Zoom lets you zoom in and out of Van Gogh's masterpieces. Collections lets you create your own museum of the artist's work. You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going."
"GoogleArtProject.com is a new online museum. The site features works by artists from around the world. The project was created to make art more accessible to the general public. It is available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Dutch."
"Physicists used to use quantum mechanics to describe small, tiny particles. But now they use it to describe the large, everyday objects around us. It didn't really sit well with my intuition, and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often"
"If everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics, then shouldn't everything just follow quantum Mechanics? I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. So a few years ago, I set off to do just that. So I made one."
"quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way. We turned off the lights, then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air. By giving it a gentle nudge, we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate."
"The difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunks of metal and you. So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time, what would that be like? How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space? Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes."
"Physicists need a good deal of logic to string together complex ideas. But at the same time, they need intuition to actually make the experiments work. You can be logical and intuitive. It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything, he says."
CNN's Jessi Drexler has spent the last week traveling around the U.S. wearing nothing new. She shows you how to look great for under $50 and how to fit in with the right people. She also shares some of the lessons she's learned.
"This week, CNN.com's Kat Kinsman shares her style tips. She says there is no look that you can't pull off. I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a different, colorful, crazy outfit for every single occasion, she says."
"CNN.com's Kat Kailani Khera says she gets all her clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores. I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner, there is always going to be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit just waiting for me, if I put a little love in my heart, she says."
"In 2009, Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis. At the next regularly scheduled election, Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform, but reconciliation as well. Lobo asked Octavio to be his chief of staff. In 2007, I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development."
"Professor Paul Romer was asked to speak at a congress in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. He was trying to persuade the Hondurans that a new city should be built on at least 1,000 square kilometers of land. He presented a slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City."
"Honduras voted to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions. To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress. A delegation of about 30 Hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business."
"Cities are worth so much more than it costs to build them, he says. Around the world, there's 700 million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else. A million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States."
"TED Talk: There may be different kinds of insights that can come from different types of anatomies I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name: charter cities My friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you, TED.com"
"Feminism is a concept of not just how to protect, but how to care for each other. I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day, each conceiving a baby, OK? She is a girl, she is raised as a girl. I'll just give you a few examples of the types of sex that isn't standard for male or female."
Intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum. Most females like me are actually androgensensitive. The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
"Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis, when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it. The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories. Our system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity"
The way we think about sex is much more complex than we first thought. It's not as simple as male and female or a man and a woman It's more complicated than that. We have to think about what we want to do with our bodies.
"I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous, he says. It makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy, he adds. What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful"
"The Founding Fathers were moving towards a naturalistic concept. They decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy, not the difference in anatomy. In doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights Movement of the future."
"I want to maintain some divisions, anatomically, in our culture. For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human. There are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me. But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them, and do they have meaning?"
"A democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart, says Dr. Richard Vedder. Vedder: I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, it feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us He says we should judge people based not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character, moving beyond anatomy."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the future of human rights in the U.S. Sutter: I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans I think we have to be in the lead of thinking about this issue, Sutter says."
"I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again. It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life. As an artist, connection is very important to me."
"Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves. They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences. Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore."
"The author says he and his partner took care of a woman who died. He says he had an epiphany that death is a part of life. It needs truth and beauty, and it's our job to hand those things out, he says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his history with the Internet. Sutter: I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room Sutter says the Internet is one of the main sources of online problems today. It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about, he says."
"Groups like Anonymous have become a major player in the field of online attacks. The US Secret Service, two months ago, froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Jain. In the future, the majority of crime will be happening online."
"DigiNotar is a certificate authority from the Netherlands  or actually, it was. Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly. You need a certificate if you have a website that has https, SSL encrypted services. These services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran."
"Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens. Western governments are doing it to themselves as well. This is not a question between privacy against security. It's a question of freedom against control. And while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011, any rights we give away will be given away."
"In 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page. And we in the West couldn't understand how anybody would do this, how much this would restrict freedom of speech. Do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now?"
"The average American makes about 70 choices in a day, CNN's John Sutter says. Sutter: We choose not to choose, even when it goes against our best selfinterests. He says a new study shows that people are more likely to buy a jar of jam when there are more choices."
"The more money a person has, the less likely they are to spend it. The more money they have, the more likely it is that they will spend it in a way that doesn't benefit them in the longterm. This is because they are more likely to spend money on things they don't really need."
"The average CEO engages in about 139 tasks in a week, according to a new study. When Proctor &amp; Gamble went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp, Shoulders to 15, they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent. Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their 10 worstselling cat litter products and saw a increase in profits by 87 percent."
"CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. Visit CNN.com/Travel each week for a new gallery of snapshots from around the world. The gallery will be open to the public on Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 10 a.m. ET."
"In order for people to understand the differences between the choices, they have to be able to understanding the consequences associated with each choice. The consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way. The third technique: Categorization. We can handle more categories than we can handle choices."
"The categories need to say something to the chooser, not the choicemaker, he says. It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can, we've just got to take it a little easier, he adds."
"The choice overload problem is one of the biggest modern day choosing problems, he says. If you keep hitting the default button per decision, that means you're getting overwhelmed, he warns. We're losing them, he says of people who go from high choice to low choice, over and over again."
CNN's John Sutter talks about how to get the most out of your life's choices. He says the key is to make sure you don't make the same mistakes over and over again. Sutter: We need to be able to choose what we want to do with our lives
"Brian Goldman: I am a redefined physician. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people Goldman: The system is evolving to make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make."
"Brian Goldman: I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change Nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat, he says. We send each one of them, including myself, out into the world"
"I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything, or as much as possible, as close to everything as possible, he says. And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. Drucker, he adds."
"I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart. And over the course of the next hour and a half or two, she started to feel better And that's when I made my first mistake. I sent her home without speaking to my attending. Maybe I didn't want to be a highmaintenance resident"
"Nurse: Do you think it's okay if she goes home? Yeah, I think she'll do okay, says doctor. I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach, he says. There's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly"
"Drucker collapsed an hour after she had arrived home. She had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock. She went to the intensive care unit, and it was clear that she was never going to wake up. At about the nine day mark, they let her go."
"I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine, he says. I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel I kept asking myself these questions. Why didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home?"
"The author was diagnosed with strep throat. He was given a prescription for penicillin and sent on his way. Two days later, he was told he had an infection that could have killed him. The story of his recovery is told in a new book, The Man Who Knew Too Much"
"In one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis. In both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care. I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice."
"Medical errors are absolutely ubiquitous, says Dr. David Perry. Perry: It's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians  those who make mistakes and those who don't. He says one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage."
"In Canada, as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors. In the U.S., the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000. In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years, we can't keep up with it."
"We're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that's very different from engineering, he says. In a sense, it's getting ahead of us. We're now using those programs to make much faster and more accurate calculations"
We're at a point in time which is analogous to when singlecelled organisms were turning into multicelling organisms. The thing is becoming faster and that's why I think it seems so confusing. But I think that there really is something coming along after us.
The future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime. We're sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is. I think that the reason is because we all feel that something's happening there.
"CNN's John Sutter looks back at the origin of life on Earth. Sutter: The only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA, Sutter says."
"The first cells learned to write down information two and a half billion years ago. In fact the recipe for us, our genes, is exactly that same code and that same way of writing. Every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code."
"Bacteria can exchange DNA, allowing communities to form that, in some sense, were in the same boat together. These communities of cells began to abstract information. They began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community. At that stage, we have multicellular communities of lots of different types of cells, working together as a single organism."
"neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up. They began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording, understanding, learning information. And that gave them an evolutionary advantage. Because at that point, an individual  learning could happen within the time span of a single organism."
"Humanity is going through the same levels that multicellular organisms have gone through. Evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds. The process is feeding on itself and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic. The more it changes, the faster it changes."
"In the most extreme cases, we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions. In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale. We put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale."
"The trick is in how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a twodimensional surface. It's not really what is realistic, it's what we think looks realistic really. I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality."
"Photos combined should have the same perspective and the same type of light. The things that make a photograph look realistic are the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives. When combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong."
"Photographer's interest in photography started as he got his first digital camera at the age of 15. He says it's easier to create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head. But it does require a lot of planning."
"Photography is more about being at the right place and the right time, he says. He wanted to create something where the process starts when you press the trigger. I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph, he adds."
"We need to make it easier for people to get the help they need It's not just a matter of finding an AED, it's about finding the right place to go We need people to be able to go to the hospital and get the care they need. We don't want people to have to wait until the last minute"
"We made an application for Layar: Augmented Reality, to find these AEDs. And we built an iPad application. And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht, and somebody collapses, you can use your iPhone, and within the next weeks also your Microsoft cellphone to find the nearest AED."
The author has been illustrating books since he was 16. He wants to use the iPad as a tool to connect readers all over the world. He has created an interactive app called Khoya to help people make sense of the world around them.
"The author says he was fascinated by the idea of fireflies in a jar as a child. The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities, he says. I become a character in the book. At various points, a little letter drops down to me, he adds."
"With mobile technology, we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology. The Apsaras is a contemporary story for children that deals with new issues like the environmental crisis. You need to go out and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower and then tag it."
"In the next book, we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on and through augmented reality, you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a houseplant that's outside your house. In the possibilities of linking together magic, the earth and technology, there are multiple possibilities."
"The author and her family were forced to flee to Australia after their father's death. They spent four years on a fishing boat in the China Sea. The author's mother carried a small bottle of poison in case they were captured by pirates. After three months in a refugee camp, they were reunited with their family."
"Four women across three generations shaping a new life together. They settled in Footscray, a workingclass suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants. Unlike the settled middleclass suburbs, their existence I was oblivious of, there was no sense of entitlement."
"I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, she says. I didn't know how to talk about anything I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb But I couldn't do that. I had to go out and help people"
"I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that, yes, the world does fall apart, but not in the way that you fear There was an energy there, an implacable optimism, a strange mixture of humility and daring It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together. This is not a finished story"
"At 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her. With no support from her husband, she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case. She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered."
"I was in the shower when my mother died. I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side. I knew she had come to say goodbye. A few days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket."
"Trevor Neilson: Can I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave, the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine, the vast horizon that guarantees nothing? I don't know. But if I could give it and still see them safely through, I would"
"Rebecca Black's Friday is one of the most popular videos of the year. The video has been seen nearly 200 million times this year. Kevin Allocca, trends manager at YouTube, explains what happened on this day. There are now 10,000 parodies of the video on YouTube."
Nyan Cat is a looped animation with looped music. It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year. Even cats were watching this video. An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something we can all actually be a part of.
"In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out. YouTube has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become famous in a part of our world's culture."
"In 2010, a video of a rainbow was viewed 23 million times on YouTube. The creator of the video says he didn't set out to make a viral video. He says the video was just one of many that have gone viral in the last few years."
"The average human lifespan has more than doubled in the last 100 years. The cost of food, electricity, transportation, communication have dropped 10 to 1,000fold. The majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile phones, air conditioning and cars."
"The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster. On this curve, riding on Moore's Law, are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies. Cloud computing, what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing. 3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet."
Peter Diamandis: Technology can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges. He says technology is a resourceliberating force. Diam and Ray Kurzweil started a new university called Singularity University. They ask students to start a company or product that can affect a billion people within a decade.
"Aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and platinum. But then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throwaway mentality. For the first time, this year the cost of solargenerated electricity is 50 percent that of dieselgenerated Electricity in India."
CNN's John Defterios talks to the inventor of a new type of water purifier. He says the technology could be used to clean up the world's water supplies. The technology could also be used in the development of new drugs and treatments.
"The world is living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted. GPS, HD video and still images, libraries of books and music, medical diagnostic technology are now dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone. The biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy."
"Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation. These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy. They will get healthier by using the Tricorder, and they'll become better educated by using Khan Academy."
"Human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers, he says. We are living into extraordinary decades ahead, he adds. If it bleeds it leads, is very true, he says of exponential technology."
"The writer's parents were born in Virginia in the 1840s. She was born in the 1880s, and her experience shaped the way she saw the world. I do get tired, as we all do. Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important, she says."
"I'm so proud of you, a janitor at a courthouse says to a young lawyer. There's no conduct in this county, it's all misconduct, the lawyer writes in a motion. My grandmother was tough, but she was also loving, says the lawyer."
"Jimmy Stevenson's mother used to hug him so hard when he was a little boy. When he was in court, a judge asked him, Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion? He replied, Yes, sir, I did. Stevenson: It connected deeply with something in me about identity, about the capacity to contribute"
"CNN's John Sutter talks to TED Talk host Chris Anderson. Anderson: We cannot be full, evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity There are opportunities all around us, Anderson says. Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on"
"We need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime, not do less I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one. And I think that's the orientation that we have to change You're an inspiring person. Thank you so much for coming to TED"
"I spend most of my time in jails, in prisons, on death row, he says. I think you can do anything you want to do, his grandmother tells him. The first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom"
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a young woman about her relationship with alcohol. The young woman was asked to promise she would never drink. She said she would, but then her brother said, What's wrong with you? Sutter: I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead."
"phthalmologist says he's never had a drop of alcohol, but his grandfather was in prison during prohibition. He says the U.S. now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. TED has an identity. When we create the right kind of identity, we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe make sense"
"One out of three Black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole. 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison. Wealth, not culpability, shapes outcomes."
"The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13yearold children to die in prison. The other way of thinking about it is not: Do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit? For every nine people who have been executed, we've identified one innocent person."
"Stevenson: We have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill, he says. I tell them about terrorism, the era that began at the end of reconstruction"
"CNN's John Defterios is a journalist and author. He is best known for his book, The Art of War, about the Second World War. Defterio: The art of war is the art of finding a way to make a difference in the world"
"In the states of the Old South, you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white. Vclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this. It's that mindheart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things."
"Bryan Johnson: There is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human We're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice, he says. I grew up in a house that was the traditional African American home that was dominated by a matriarch"
"I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done, she says. I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them, they're not just a thief. And because of that, there's this basic human dignity that must be respected"
"We won't be judged by our design, we will be judged on our work, he says. I don't believe that. I actually think, in too many places, the opposite of justice is justice It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year, he adds."
"Nine cities are planning to use the app, which takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally. It suggests how government could work better  not more like a private company, as many people think it should. The app represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government."
"Program is called Code for America, and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks. What we do together that we can't do alone, says Tim O'Reilly. Politics is not changing; government is changing, he says."
"Boston has an app, a Web and mobile app, called Citizens Connect. Citizens Connect allows people to report opossums in their neighborhoods. The app is public, so everybody can see the opossum's location. It's also a great example of government getting in on the crowdsourcing game."
"Government is like a vast ocean and politics is the sixinch layer on top. When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen our communities. We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money. But it's also a great example of government as a platform."
"The OccupytheSEC movement has written a 325page response to the SEC's request for comment on the Financial Reform Bill. We have to engage with the machinery of government. That's not being politically active, that's being bureaucratically active, says Al."
"CNN's John Sutter talks with Code for America fellows about using their hands to make government work better. Sutter: This is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted. He asks: When it comes to the big, important things that we need to do together, all of us together, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we also going to use our hands?"
"LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function. They're preengineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors. The bricks are colorcoded. Green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire."
"LittleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures. We want to make every single interaction in the world into a readytouse brick. Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors  everything should be accessible. We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them."
LittleBits is an opensource project that lets people make their own LEGO bricks. The first LEGO bricks were made in the 1930s and became the world's mostused construction unit. LittleBits was created by a group of students at the University of Cambridge.
"In 2000 AD, asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth. If you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this, you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how, up until a certain point in time, asteroids would demolish the surface of a planet."
"Intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped. The equation is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc for intelligence that I've seen. The video below shows some of the amazing applications of this equation."
"I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in the traditional sense, not just the gay closet. I've got this little bit from Vanity Monologues I'm even going to do a little bit of Sex and the City I'm a girl. I like to wear my comfy jammies"
"CNN's Robin Roberts says coming out of a closet was the easiest hard conversation she's ever had. She says we all live in closets, and they may feel safe, or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door. But a closet is no place for a person to live."
"The experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal. I was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any fouryearold that walked into the cafe I had brain surgery 18 years ago, and since that time, brain science has become a personal passion of mine"
"Google's John Defterios: Mental images, for most of us, are central in inventive and creative thinking I have lots of great, really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed, he says."
"Part of the brain that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters was missing after surgery. The father of three is one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter. I'm an experimentalist at heart, so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages"
"A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very submissive, says Malala. She is confined under the four walls of her home. She becomes the socalled honor of her father and of her brothers. If she transgresses the code, she could even be killed."
"Malala Yousafzai's father says he was fascinated with a heroic freedom fighter in Afghanistan. I don't like newborn children, to be honest, but when I looked into her eyes, I got extremely honored, he says. The story of women is the story of injustice, inequality, violence and exploitation"
"When she was eight years old, she was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating the mysteries of gender. At 15, she met a woman named T.L. who convinced her to join a beauty pageant. She won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up."
Geena Peralta was born in the Philippines and moved to the U.S. in 2001. She became a fashion model and competed in beauty pageants as a child. She says she is not alone in her struggle to break free of the limitations imposed by her skin.
Chris Kluwe: What do augmented reality and professional football have to do with empathy? Kluwe shows what it's like to get tackled on the football field from the perspective of the tacklee. Kluwe says the Oculus Rift is one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created.
"CK: What do you think fan's experience is going to be when we take video footage of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line, shedding a tackler with a stiffarm before sprinting in for a touchdown? CK: I think adult diaper sales may surge. But this is not yet augmented reality. This is only virtual reality, V.R."
"In 2023, imagine you're a player walking back to the huddle and you have your next play displayed right in front of your face. With Google Glass, we can get a sense of what it's like to be running down the field at 100 mph."
"I am here to tell you that we have been lied to about disability, he says. We've been sold the lie that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T To live with a disability makes you exceptional. It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you exceptional, he adds."
The author is the author of the book Inspiration porn The book is about the idea that disabled people can be inspired by images of disabled people. The author says the images are objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people.
"The author's father taught him how to shoot a gun. He says he's never been able to do anything like it. I'm not a fighter, I'm a victim, he says. It's not about me, it's about the people I love"
"Madeleine Aronson was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1983 to an Egyptian engineer and a loving American mother. Her father exposed her to a side of Islam that few people, including the majority of Muslims, get to see. Madeleine: If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would have meaning or value"
"TED Talk: Why are we conscious? Why aren't we just robots who process all this input, produce all that output, without experiencing the inner movie at all? Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions. To integrate consciousness into science, some radical ideas may be needed."
"The centerpiece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for correlations, correlations between certain areas of the brain and certain states of consciousness. We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why they do. Why is there this inner subjective movie?"
"consciousness is a kind of anomaly, one that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how. We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation, we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains parts of psychology. But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture."
"Theory of consciousness is based on the idea that there is no hard problem of consciousness. Theories of consciousness are based on a reductionist brainbased theory of consciousness, he says. But he says that view is too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory."
"According to the EPA, Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors. That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize. The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental, a fundamental building block of nature."
"Architects have been using this trick for more than 200 years. The trick is to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of. Building things is terrifying. It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated"
"We push and we push until we completely alienate all of you, says the author. We take these forms that we know you love and we update them It's about concrete. It's about making a difference in the world, he says."
We're all hanging out in malls and we can create our own architectural fantasies. We add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials. It was crazy. But it's the '80s. And we can't give you enough of it.
"In the late '80s and early '90s, architects started experimenting with something called deconstructivism. The New York Times called the Guggenheim Bilbao, by Frank Gehry, a miracle. Gehry is our very first starchitect."
"The hymen is like a scrunchie in function as well as in looks. It's elastic enough to handle a vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage. For other women, the hymen may tear a bit to make room for the penis, but that won't make it disappear."
"The myth that the hymen breaks and bleeds the first time a woman has vaginal sex is untrue. The absurdity of virgin testing is illustrated in a study done on 36 pregnant teenagers. There is no virgin seal that magically disappears after sex, and half of virgins can easily have sex."
"We want every girl, parent and [future] husband to know what the hymen is and how it works It's a question of cultural and religious control of women's sexuality. And that is much harder to change We opt for using nothing. If you really want to know if a woman is a virgin or not, ask her"
"Scientists have been drilling deep into the ocean to find new life. They have found deepsea mud that looks like it has been there for millions of years. The mud is actually made up of a variety of different organisms, including some that make fuel."
"This is what real DNA looks like, from a gene that these species happen to share. Everything lines up nearly perfectly. The chances of getting so many of those vertical columns where every species has a C or every species have a T, by random chance, are infinitesimal."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at a family tree of microbes on Earth. He says we're kin to every living thing on Earth, and that we're as different from each other as we are from pine trees. Defterius: They're not like anything we've ever seen before He says they're a highly diverse microbial ecosystem on Earth"
"No human has ever gotten a single one of these exotic deep subsurface microbes to grow in a petri dish. That may sound disappointing, but I actually find it exhilarating, because it means there are so many tantalizing unknowns to work on. We were going to read their genes like a recipe book, find out what it was they wanted to eat and put it in their petri dishes. But when we looked at their genes, it turns out that what they wanted"
"Scientists are trying to determine how deep we can go to find life on Earth. If these things wanted to colonize our throats and make us sick, they would get muscled out by fastgrowing streptococcus before they could even initiate cell division. Perhaps the fact that the deep subsurface is so boring is actually an asset to these microbes."
"There is no theoretical limit on the lifespan of a single cell. A single cell could live for hundreds of thousands of years. If we could find out how, we could use the same technique in cancer cells, for example, to extend the life of cancer cells."
There are a hundred billion billion billlion living microbial cells underlying all the world's oceans. That's 200 times more than the total biomass of humans on this planet. What seems like a day to them might be a thousand years to us. Most protein consumed on the African continent is cropbased.
"We share pathogens, and thus diseases, with the species we live closest to: our livestock. Recent reports show that the deadly dozen zoonotic diseases kill 2.2 million people and sicken 2.4 billion people annually. The greatest burden of zoonoses falls on one billion poor livestock keepers."
"iCow teaches farmers best livestock practices using SMS over simple, lowend phones. Farmers receive three SMSs a week on best livestock practice, and those that execute the messages go on to see increases in productivity within as short a time as three months. The African Dairy Genetic Gains program is using SMS and cuttingedge genomics."
"Working with smallholder farmers is one of the best ways to guarantee food security, he says. The numbers of stunted children under the age of five, in most regions of the world, has been declining. 59 million children, three in 10 in that age group, struggle to meet their genetic potential  their full genetic potential."
"My father died on a Friday. He was 42 years old and I was 15. At school, I drifted from science to mathematics to history to biology. From May to July to September to November, I went about with my usual smile. I was praised for being strong."
"I started to use food to numb my pain, says the author. I see you, and by seeing you, I bring you into being It was a simple act but nothing short of a revolution for me, she says."
"World Health Organization tells us that depression is now the single leading cause of disability globally. People's tendency is more and more to lock down into rigid responses to their emotions. A third of us  a third  either judge ourselves for having socalled bad emotions, like sadness, anger or even grief."
"Being positive has become a new form of moral correctness. People with cancer are automatically told to just stay positive. Women, to stop being so angry. Our thoughts, our emotions and our stories that help us to thrive in an increasingly complex and fraught world."
"The more you try to ignore it, the greater its hold on you. Internal pain always comes out. And who pays the price? We do. Our children, our colleagues, our communities. How we deal with our inner world drives everything."
"The conventional view of emotions as good or bad, positive or negative, is rigid. Tough emotions are part of our contract with life. You don't get to have a meaningful career or raise a family without stress and discomfort. Discomfort is the price of admission to a meaningful life."
"Emotional agility is more than just an acceptance of emotions. When we are open to the difficult emotions, we are able to generate responses that are valuesaligned. We tend not to feel strong emotion to stuff that doesn't mean anything in our worlds."
"When you feel a strong, tough emotion, don't race for the emotional exits. Instead, try to notice the feeling for what it is. Emotions are data, they are not directives. We own our emotions, they don't own us."
"When people are allowed to feel their emotional truth, engagement, creativity and innovation flourish in the organization. Emotional agility is the ability to be with your emotions with curiosity, compassion, and especially the courage to take valuesconnected steps. The most resilient individuals, teams, organizations, families, communities are built on an openness to the normal human emotions."
"Sawubona: When our moment comes to face our fragility, it will ask us, Are you agile? Are you agile? Let the moment be an unreserved yes. A yes born of a lifelong correspondence with your own heart. And in seeing yourself, you are also able to see others."
Cost of solar panels has collapsed by 95 percent over the last 30 years. The appliance network has also come down in cost. The cell phone revolution has piggybacked on the solar revolution. The opportunity has come to convert some of that solar power into energy at the household level.
"27 billion dollars is what people like Susan spend every year on cell phone charging, flashlight batteries and kerosene to light their homes. The lightbulb comes from this idea that you have an energy system that's made up of the ideas of Tesla and Thomas Edison."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at the potential of solar energy in Kenya. He says it could lead to a fullyfunctioning lowcarbon economy. Defterio: It's not just about the lightbulb, it's about the whole system"
"The problem is that the sun only shines for 12 hours a day, so we need to find a way to make more use of it. We need to get more efficient with our existing energy resources. We can do this by using more of the existing infrastructure, such as power stations."
"Mwende Katwiwa is a poet, a PanAfricanist and a freedom fighter. The revolution is an echo of the cell phone revolution. Photons are wireless, they fall on every rooftop and they generate enough power to be sufficient for every household need."
"The poet says being Black in America has made motherhood sound like mourning. I do not want a stanza for a son nor a line for a little girl, she says. Poetry is not about art and performance. It is a form of protest"
"The death of Trayvon Martin, a 17yearold Black boy, reminded me how little this nation values Black life. The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter became the most recognized call for Black people and our children to live in safe environments and healthy communities."
"Toni Morrison wrote, In times of dread, artists must never choose to remain silent. There is no time for selfpity, no room for fear Writer says she's always wanted to be a mother, but doesn't know if she can stomach motherhood in the U.S."
"The author says she has learned that anger is the price of love. She says that when we suppress our rage, that's when it hardens into hate. We love ourselves when we breathe through the fire of pain and refuse to let it harden"
"CNN.com editorinchief Roxanne Jones: We need to practice all three forms of love Jones: In order to love others, see no stranger. I choose to wonder about you. I will listen for your stories and pick up a sword when you are in harm's way"
"In the darkness, we breathe and we dance. Our family becomes a pocket of revolutionary love. What if our future is not dead, but still waiting to be born? Remember the wisdom of the midwife. Breathe, she says. And then  push."
"Revolutionary love requires us to breathe and push through the fire with a warrior's heart and a saint's eyes, she writes. You will teach him how to love himself because you love yourself, she tells her son. Love is sweet labor, she says."
"Love is the call of our times, writes author. In our most painful moments, in the face of injustice, we have seen love deliver us I see no stranger. I see no enemy. And if I wonder about them, then I will listen to their stories, she says."
"I will even vow to protect them when they are in harm's way, she says. I was a little girl in two long braids, but I promised. To walk the path of a warrior saint I will refuse to hate them even when they hate me, she adds."
"The first person killed in the 9/11 attacks was a Sikh man. He was killed by a man who called himself a patriot The victim's widow asked her husband's family to tell his story to the nation. She said, Tell them, 'Thank you.'"
"I have to reckon with the fact that my son is growing up in a country more dangerous for him than the one I was given, she says. There will be moments when I cannot protect him when he is seen as a terrorist ... But my mother was at my side"
"I wanted to abandon my post. But I made a promise, so I returned to the gas station where Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed 15 years to the day, he says. I set down a candle in the spot where he bled to death. His brother, Rana, turned to me and said, Nothing has changed"
"I am sorry for what I did to your brother. One day when I go to heaven to be judged by God, I will ask to see your brother Forgiveness is not forgetting. It is freedom from hate When we are free from hate, we see the ones who hurt us not as monsters, but as people who feel threatened"
LZ Granderson: Tending to the wound is how we learn to love ourselves. He says we need to be able to forgive ourselves for our mistakes. Granderson says we must also learn to forgive those who have hurt us.
"Scientist says emotions are as important in science as they are in any other part of our lives. Science is made by humans, and as human beings, even if we try hard, we cannot get rid of our emotions, he says. I believe that even in science, we should make use of our feelings, he adds."
"In 2015, a group of scientists were told to stop working on a project. The project was to develop materials for blueshining OLEDs. The group decided to continue working on the project, even though it was to end. The result was that the team was able to take on more responsibility."
"We were sitting together in the lab, or occasionally in the caf, sharing our sadness about the end of our project as well as the joy in our work, he says. We were working with such personal engagement on a project already sentenced to death because we felt connected to something meaningful"
"Scientists should not be afraid of using feelings to implement and to catalyze factbased science and innovation. Emotions and logic do not oppose each other. The feeling of being dedicated to something meaningful, of belonging to something bigger and of being empowered is crucial for creativity."
"Cancer is the prey and the immune system is the predator. Both need nutrients to survive. If cancer cells outcompete the immune cells for nutrients, they won't be able to do their job. One of the best ways to extinguish species is not to target them directly."
"The field of mathematical modeling has matured in recent years. The power and beauty of modeling lies in the fact that it makes you formalize, in a very rigorous way, what we think we know. The immediate goal of my research is to advance research and innovation and to reduce its cost."
"Mathematical modeling can help us answer questions that directly affect people's health. It can identify gaps in knowledge and logical inconsistencies. Mathematical models will be key to propelling personalized medicine, says Dr. Michael Bociurkiw. It all comes down to asking the right question, he says."
"The same coping mechanisms that get us through all kinds of life challenges fail us so miserably when our heart gets broken. When your heart is broken, the same instincts you ordinarily rely on will time and again lead you down the wrong path. Having a clear understanding of why the relationship ended is really important for our ability to move on."
Kathy became convinced something must have happened during her romantic getaway with Rich that soured him on the relationship. Brain studies have shown that the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms in our brain that get activated when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids.
"Getting over heartbreak is not a journey. It's a fight, and your reason is your strongest weapon. There is no breakup explanation that's going to feel satisfying. No rationale can take away the pain you feel. You have to be willing to let go, to accept that it's over."
CNN's John Sutter talks about how to get over a breakup. He says it's important to remember that the person you're with is not perfect. Sutter: You have to remind yourself that you're not the one who broke up with them
Miguel was devastated by his wife's decision to leave him. He barely functioned at work for many months. Heartbreak is a complex psychological injury. It impacts us in a multitude of ways. It temporarily lowers our IQ. It can also cause intrusive thoughts and anxiety.
"Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend; he lost his entire social life, the supportive community of Sharon's church. The voids in your identity: you have to reestablish who you are and what your life is about. If you refuse to be misled by your mind and you take steps to heal, you can significantly minimize your suffering."
"A study shows that 70 percent of workers in the US are disengaged. This is costing the companies 550 billion dollars a year every year. So removing unfairness and promoting fairness should be our priority. And if you're hurting, know this: it's difficult, it is a battle within your own mind."
"In the 1990s, Italian oil exploration team found more oil and gas than any other company in the world. The discovery team had no special tool to make the discovery, so they had to rely on luck. Now, the team has developed a system of reward and punishment to get the best out of its workers."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the importance of fairness in the oil industry. Sutter: These guys knew what they were doing. They weren't going to be penalized for bad luck or for an honest mistake It's when you can lower those unfairness antennae, put them at rest"
"These guys could be true to their purpose, which was finding oil and gas. They didn't have to worry about company politics or greed or fear. They could be good risktakers, because they weren't too defensive. And they were excellent team workers."
"I learned that to be fair, my colleagues and I, we needed to take a risk and stick our head out, but in a fair system, he says. This is because science shows that humans have an innate sense of fairness. We know what is right and what is wrong before we can talk or think"
"When we see or perceive fairness, our brain releases a substance that gives us pleasure. But when we perceive unfairness, we feel pain ... even greater pain than the same type of pain as if I really hurt myself. Unfairness triggers the primitive, reptile part of our brain, the part that deals with threats and survival."
"We try to filter out as much unfairness as we can, he says. It's very hard to make them part of our decisionmaking process We're trying to get to the heart of the problem, he adds, and that's how we can make progress"
"We all know deep inside what the answer is to unfairness, says author. To know what the right answer is is pretty cool for decisionmaking Wouldn't it be great to have colleagues and bosses that were selected and trained for fairness and for character"
"CNN's John Sutter asks: Where can we push ourselves beyond what's rational and do what's right? Sutter talks about a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. CTE is a brain disease that causes memory loss, depression and aggression. Sutter: It's one of the root causes of polarization"
"In 2006, former Philadelphia Eagles strong safety Andre Waters took his life. The medical examiner in Pittsburgh decided to look at their brains and found this disease. I stopped counting my concussions at 15. I wouldn't say anything, I'd just sniff smelling salts, Waters said."
"The medical examiner in Florida didn't believe that CTE was a real disease. The next of kin was Andre Waters's 88yearold mother. The family was so gracious about the call and said, You know what, we want to know what happened"
"The former NFL player was the third NFL player diagnosed with CTE. He started the Concussion Legacy Foundation to formalize research into the disease. The foundation is the first center in the world focused on CTE, he says. My job is to get the brains for Dr. Ann McKee"
"It's a tough way to live. And it's hard on me and it's even worse on these poor families that I've been calling for their brains, he says. What if it became normal for athletes to donate their brain after they died? he asks."
"Over 2,500 athletes have signed up to donate their brains to the project. Brain banks have acquired 500 brains and found over 300 of them had CTE. Only 45 cases existed in the world of this disease that had been studied in brain banks."
Of the first 111 NFL players we looked at 110 were positive for this disease. We can prevent this disease if we just stopped hitting people in the head so much. We still can't diagnose CTE in living people. We have no treatments that are going to be coming out of the pharmaceutical industry in the next five years.
"Petter Johansson wrote a book called Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis Johansson: I found there's this whole story about concussions that we weren't really being told This way we would know when people are wrong about themselves, Johansson says."
Photographer Petter Johansson asks his subjects why they prefer certain faces. One woman says she likes her smile and contour of the nose and face. Another man says he likes her haircut and the way it's lit and looks. Johansson: So they get the opposite of their choice
"PJ: I just have to ask a few questions. What were the reasons, why did they do it? Woman 3: I don't know, he looks a little bit like the Hobbit. Man: No. I didn't notice any of that. PJ: Switching the pictures as far as ..."
Researchers manipulated the responses of participants in a series of experiments. The results were similar to what they said when they were asked to explain their choices. The researchers say the results suggest that people make up their own answers when asked why they made certain choices.
"Researchers in Sweden found that people often prefer the alternative they were led to believe they liked. The effect is known as choice blindness Researchers also found that the effect extended to more complex, more meaningful choices. The researchers are now trying to find out if the effect applies to moral and political issues."
"Before each election, newspapers and polling institutes put together what they call an election compass It consists of a number of dividing issues that sort of separates the two coalitions. We walked up to people in the street and asked if they wanted to do a quick political survey"
Psychologists asked participants to answer questions about themselves. They were then asked to sum up their overall score. The results showed that 90 percent of the participants' answers had been changed. The researchers are now trying to find out why people change their answers.
Voting intention is also clearly affected by the questionnaire. 10 participants shift from left to right or from right to left. 19 participants go from clear voting intention to being uncertain. Some go from being uncertain to clear voting intend. A number of participants stay uncertain throughout the experiment.
"People often think they know the answer when they ask why, but they may be wrong. When you ask people why, you create an attitude that wasn't there before you asked the question. If you want to look at it from a positive direction, it could be seen as showing that we're actually a little bit more flexible than we think."
"The hippocampus is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new longterm memories for facts and events. The second key area is located in the temporal lobe, shown right here. How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, can form a memory that has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime?"
"Professor of neural science discovered the brainchanging effects of exercise. He spent too much time listening to those brain cells in a dark room, by himself. He went on a riverrafting trip  by himself, because he had no social life."
"I said, I'm never going to feel like the weakest person on a riverrafting trip again I focused my typeA personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym. I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard"
"Exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. Simply moving your body, has immediate, longlasting and protective benefits for the brain."
"Exercise changes the brain's anatomy, physiology and function. The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets. You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain."
"You don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects. The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session. And the good news is, you don't need to get a very expensive gym membership."
"The prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead, is critical for things like decisionmaking, focus, attention and your personality. Exercise will not only give you a happier, more protective life today, but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases."
"The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300 million people globally suffer from depression. Every 40 seconds, someone somewhere in the world commits suicide because they are unhappy. Most of these deaths are occurring in low and middleincome countries. But one thing that we do know is that depression can be treated and suicides averted."
"Farai: In my country, there are 12 psychiatrists, and I'm one of them, for a population of approximately 14 million. One evening while I was at home, I get a call from the ER, or the emergency room, from a city which is some 200 kilometers away from where I live. I obviously can't get into my car in the middle of the night and drive 200 kilometers."
"Psychiatrist in Harare, Zimbabwe, started training grandmothers in evidencebased talk therapy. Empower them with the skills to listen, to show empathy, all of that rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy. Support them with behavior activation, activity scheduling; and support them using digital technology."
"Hundreds of grandmothers are working in more than 70 communities. In the last year alone, more than 30,000 people received treatment on the Friendship Bench. Grandmothers were more effective at treating depression than doctors, a clinical trial showed. There are more than 600 million people currently aged above 65."
"HIVpositive grandmothers are making a difference in the lives of thousands of people. I'm sure she's in awe when she realizes that something that she helped to pioneer is now spreading to other countries, like Malawi, the island of Zanzibar, says author."
"Young African Refugees for Integral Development (YARID) was set up by three Congolese refugees. YARID offers free English classes, vocational training and livelihood opportunities for refugees. The organization is based in the Ugandan capital, Kampala."
"We've seen so many families become selfsustaining. We know our community better than anyone, she says. Rather than wasting money on building walls, it would be better to help refugees to help themselves Give us the support we deserve, and we will pay you back, she adds."
"Roxanne Jones: We are missing out on the best talent. She says we need to look beyond the traditional places of work. Jones says we should look for people who can make a difference in the lives of others. We need to find new ways to connect with people, she says, not just recruit."
Candidates should be asked to demonstrate their skills before they're hired. Work samples are one of the best predictors of success on the job. A 2010 study found that only a quarter of college graduates work in a field that relates to their degree.
"The author is a product manager at Etsy, a social media company. She says we need to stop equating experience with competence. We could live in a world where people are seen for what they're truly capable of, she says. It's time to stop settling for the safe"
"I didn't see pants; I saw opportunity, says author. That day, instead of being invisible, I chose to be looked at, just by wearing something different Fashion can communicate our differences to the world for us, she says. We should express ourselves, wear what we want"
"In India, when a woman dies, she is not allowed to wear white clothes. Malala Yousafzai was photographed in white jeans and a black top. She says she was attacked online for wearing the clothes. Yousufzai: What's the worst that could happen? The fashion police will get you"
"Widows of Vrindavan have started to celebrate Holi, the Indian festival of color, which they are prohibited from participating in. With every handful of the powder they throw into the air, their white saris slowly start to suffuse with color."
"Fashion can create visual disruption for us  on us, literally. This disruption, any kind of dissonance, can be the first gauntlet we throw down in a battle against oppression. Karar Nushi, a student and actor from Iraq, loved his vibrant, eclectic clothes. He soon started receiving death threats for how he looked."
"In Peshawar, Pakistani transgender activist Alisha was shot multiple times. She was taken to the hospital, but because she dressed in women's clothing, she was refused access to either the men's or the women's wards. What we choose to wear can sometimes be literally life and death. The time is now to stand up, to stand out."
"Fashion can let us literally wear our courage on our sleeves, he says. Wear it like armor. Wear it because it matters. And wear it because you matter I think this went straight to God's voicemail, though, he adds. I was not going to magically change"

"CNN's John Sutter looks at the unintended consequences of new tech. Sutter: Driverless cars will take away the need for the DMV. He also looks at what social media has done to dating. Suter: I don't know about you, but I do not want to live in a world where harsh fluorescent lights, terrible forms"
"Nobody will own their car in the future, and that means teenagers will not have a place to make out. Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates have all gone on record expressing grave reservations about artificial intelligence. The DMV: come for the registration renewal, stay for the satisfaction of knowing you made some pretty good life choices."
"We are actually teaching machines how to think, how to understand our behavior, and how to defend themselves. The one thing that's for sure: the creation always despises its creator. What we need to do before we perfect artificial intelligence is perfect artificial emotions. That way, we can teach the robots or machines to love us."

CNN's John Defterios says the world is in a state of crisis. He says it's time to change the way we look at the world. Defterio: The world needs a new way of seeing the world He says the U.S. can't afford to wait for the world to get back on track.
"In the U.S. and elsewhere, governments began to weave a safety net so that the next time there was a crash there would be programs like social security to catch people. The Depression period, along with the transformation of allied nations and economies during the World War II effort, show us that it is possible for complex societies to rapidly transform themselves."
"This was a time, let's remember, of tremendous ideological ferment, when many different ideas about how to organize societies did battle with one another in the public square. This was an era of explosive imagining. The victories of the New Deal didn't happen just because suddenly everybody understood the brutalities of laissezfaire."
"We think about political change in defined compartments. Within each compartment, there are thousands upon thousands of different groups and NGOs, each competing with one another for credit, name recognition and of course, resources. The problem of silos is understandable. They carve up our complex world into manageable chunks."
"Progressive movement is missing a coherent picture of the world we're fighting for, says Frida Ghitis. When largescale crises hit us, there isn't any agreement on what that place is, she says. Ghitis: It's as if we're no longer walking, but leaping"
"The Leap was a twoday meeting of activists in Canada. The aim was to come up with a statement describing the world after we win. The group included indigenous elders, union leaders, faith leaders and feminist icons. It was not easy work, says leader of the Leap group."
"The Leap is a new social movement based in Vancouver, Canada. It calls for a culture of caretaking, in which no one and nowhere is thrown away. The Leap has been picked up around the world with similar platforms, being written from Nunavut to Australia."
Crises test us. We either fall apart or we grow up fast. Finding new reserves of strength and capacity that we never knew we had can transform us. But first we need to picture the world that we're fighting for. And we have to dream it up together.
"The architect says a prison is the worst building type we could have created to address the harm that we're doing to one another.

"The first surgeon in my country came from that rural village. We would contribute money to send a neighbor's child to school. And so we have a surgeon. And very soon, isirika began to become small. In each place, I gained a new vocabulary."
"I just want to imagine what it would look like if everyone in this room  a medical doctor, a parent, a lawyer, a philanthropist, whatever you are  if you embraced isirika and made it your default, she says. That is the essence of seeing a person first"
"We have one planet and we don't have two choices about that, she says. There's not going to be a wall that is high enough to separate humanity Every idea counts  small or big counts, she adds. It is a privilege to give more"

"TED speaker: If you want to solve the world's biggest problems, invest in women and girls The challenge begins today because we see women everywhere organizing as isirika, she says. Women who know how to protect themselves know what it means to make a difference, she adds."
"Musimbi Kanyoro: My mother was isirika. She was not a project or a program. She embraced charity, services and philanthropy all together. Musimbi: If we are going to have over 350 trillion dollars by 2030, those dollars need to be in the hands of women."
"According to the US Department of Education, more than 85 percent of black male fourth graders are not proficient in reading. As a society, we're creating reading experiences for children that are the equivalent of telling bar jokes in a church. The more challenges to reading children face, the more culturally competent educators need to be."
Less than two percent of teachers in the U.S. are black males. There are literally young black boys who have never seen a black man reading Barbershop Books is a program to help young black men identify as readers.

"In the 1980s, child abuse was a subject no one wanted to talk about. Today, the stigma that's there is about loneliness. Being lonely can have a significant impact on your own wellbeing. It's a simple concept that can be applied across all areas of life."
"Lonely people are twice at risk of Alzheimer's disease. Loneliness is actually more harmful that smoking 15 cigarettes. It can lead to higher blood pressure, higher levels of depression, and actually aligned to mortality rates more associated with alcohol abuse or smoking cigarettes."
"The Silver Line is a new national helpline in the UK for older people. In its short history, we've taken 1.5 million calls. Some people might be calling up for a friendly chat, maybe some information about local services. Some may be calling because they're suicidal."
"In 2017, we have over 200 staff listening to older people every day of the year, 24/7. We also have over 3,000 volunteers making weekly friendship calls from their own home. My favorite group is the music group, where people, every week, play musical instruments."

The London Underground map was created by an engineer in 1908. He used simple colors to show different parts of the city. The idea is to make it easy for people to find their way around. He says the same principle can be applied to almost any project.
"The hoodie has come to signify in the past few years in the U.S. It's one of those timeless objects that we hardly think of, because they're part of our lives. The real powerful person is wearing a hoodie with a Tshirt and jeans."
Paola Antonelli: The hoodie has been an icon throughout history for good and for bad reasons. The modern incarnation of the hoodie was introduced in the 1930s by Knickerbocker Knitting Company. The earliest ones that we can trace are from ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

"The jump rope is such a simple object. It crosses cultures. It can be made out of rope, a clothesline, twine. The rope became a big thing when women's clothes became more fitted and the pantaloon came into being. There's some evidence that it began in ancient Egypt."
"In the 1950s, girls were able to jump rope because their skirts wouldn't catch the ropes. Even formerly enslaved African children in the antebellum South jumped rope, too. The skipping rope was like a steady timeline, upon which you can add rhymes and rhythms and chants."
"The design of a button hasn't changed much since the Middle Ages. For me, the best buttons are usually round. There are no bad buttons, there are only bad people. I think stairs may be one of the most emotionally malleable physical elements."
"David Rockwell: Stairs fill a deeply human need we have to inhabit a space more than just on the ground plane. The stoop is a place that invites neighbors to gather, blast music, and watch the city in motion. The staircase that remained standing after September 11th was dubbed the Survivors' Staircase"
"Staircases were a means of getting to a higher elevation, which people sought for worship or for protection. People climbed using whatever was available: stepped logs, ladders and natural pathways. In 1982, researchers at the University of Maryland developed a system they called HyperTIES."
"Margaret Gould Stewart: The hyperlink is an interface element, a building block to a complex web of connections that exists all around the world. Stewart: To me, it's one of the most democratic designs ever created. This is going to change everything about how we communicate, Stewart says."
Vannevar Bush wrote Vicky an apology a year after he began his journey. Vicky was clearly a troubled kid. Bush: Messages such as yours cannot absolve you of your past actions. The only way to do that is to improve the world and foster compassion.
"When he was 10 years old, John Sutter asked a girl what shampoo she used. Sutter: I treated another human being like some worthless other ... like I was better than her Sutter says he forgot about this memory for a long time. He reached out to friends and eventually social media to try to find Vicky."
"The author noticed he was having mean thoughts and wanting to say them. I noticed the world around me seemed to be getting more hateful, too, he says. So I did what all overly intellectual people do when they have a problem that they want to understand"
"I'm not saying hate was the only reason I picked on Vicky or even that I was consciously hateful, he says. But the fact is, the people we discriminate against in our public policies and in our culture are also the groups of people most likely to be bullied in school"
"Hate and racism have the same roots, don't they? In the historic patterns of racism and sexism that have shaped our history. Or what if you believe that group of people is inferior but you aren't aware that you believe it  what's known as implicit bias."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to former Nazis, terrorists and genocidal killers. Bassam Aramin tried to blow up an Israeli military convoy when he was 16. After prison, Bassam went on to get a master's degree in Holocaust studies. He founded an organization where former Palestinian combatants and Israeli combatants come together."

"In the U.S., threequarters of white people don't have any nonwhite friends. We need to change that. It will not happen overnight. It needs to happen, she says. It's not that complicated, right? But it's hard. I mean, everyone did it."
Hate is so ingrained in our minds and in our society that it can feel inevitable and impossible to change. Just look at the terrorist who became a peace activist. Or the bully who learned to apologize to her victim. Even the teachers picked on her.
"In Africa, 95% of people say religion is an important part of their lives. In the U.S., only 1 in 4 people say they believe in God. In Africa, 1 in 5 people believe that God can help them achieve their dreams."
"In Africa, superstition is widespread, with so many people believing in witchcraft. Yet alleged witches, usually women, children and elderly persons are still routinely attacked, banished and killed. So as a humanist, I believe we must be adventurous and even daring. To think what people have never thought."
"Humanism is a way of thinking and living that emphasizes the agency of human beings. Human beings are creative beings. We have the power to generate new ideas, new solutions and new cures. It is in our nature to create anew, to be inventive and innovative."
"For too long, we have been prisoners of our past. We have allowed despair and pessimism to drain us, drain our energies, limit our imaginations and dim our vision for a better and brighter future. We need to put an end to this game of blame that has prevented us from taking full responsibility for our own lives."
"Nigeria's first black president, Goodluck Jonathan, gives a TED Talk. He says his parents did not allow the circumstances of their bad upbringing to determine the ambition and dreams for themselves and for their children.

"I think this was a time when my family really began to realize what disability meant to some people, she says. We had an amazing judge, the first African American female federal judge, she adds. And she knew discrimination when she saw it"
"We needed to fight back people's view that if you had a disability, you needed to be cured, she says. We were learning from the Civil Rights Movement and from the Women's Rights Movement How many people do you think it takes to stop traffic on Madison Avenue during rush hour? she asks."
"In 1972, President Nixon vetoed the Rehabilitation Act. We protested. He signed it. Then the regulations that needed to be promulgated to implement that law had not in fact been signed. We demonstrated. They were signed. And then President Bush signed the ADA on the lawn of the White House. It was an amazing day."
The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was adopted in 2006. It is the first international human rights treaty fully focused on disabled people. More than 165 countries have joined this treaty. But the US Senate has failed to recommend to our president that we ratify the treaty.
"The language we speak can shape the way we think, says Dr. Richard Quest. Quest: People have been speculating about this question forever Quest: Until recently, there hasn't been any data to help us decide either way. Now we have actual scientific data to weigh in on this question, Quest says."
"In Kuuk Thaayorre, everything is in cardinal directions: north, south, east and west. In the way that you say hello in the language, Which way are you going? should be, Northnortheast in the far distance"
"There is a big difference in cognitive ability across languages. One group  very distinguished group like you guys  doesn't know which way is which. In another group, a fiveyearold and they would know. There are also really big differences in how people think about time."
"When we sat people facing south, they organized time from left to right. When we sat them facing east, time came towards the body. For the Kuuk Thaayorre, time is locked on the landscape. For me, if I'm facing this way, then time goes this way."
"Some languages don't have exact number words. Some languages have lots of words for colors, some have only a couple words, light and dark Russian speakers are faster to be able to tell the difference between a light and dark blue. English speakers, for example, don't make this categorical distinction."
"Every noun gets assigned a gender, often masculine or feminine. These genders differ across languages. The sun is feminine in German but masculine in Spanish, and the moon, the reverse. German speakers are more likely to say bridges are beautiful, elegant and stereotypically feminine words."
"Language can transmit knowledge across minds. People who speak different languages will pay attention to different things, depending on what their language usually requires them to do. English speakers will remember who did it, because English requires you to say, He did it; he broke the vase"
"There are 7,000 languages spoken around the world. We're losing one language a week, and half of the world's languages will be gone in the next hundred years. Language can have really broad effects. It can shape how you're thinking about anything."
"What we know about the human mind is actually incredibly narrow and biased. There are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world. Some languages have different sounds, they have different vocabularies, and they also have different structures. The language that you speak shapes the way that you think."
"ChopArt is a nonprofit organization that provides a safe haven for homeless teens. The organization is based in Atlanta, Georgia, but also has offices in India and Ghana. The group's founder says it's important to provide a safe place for the homeless to find their voice."

"I don't know what the appeal is of the word 'fascinating', says the author. It doesn't sound like a good word, he adds, but it is. It's a word that can be applied to anything, he says. You can do anything you want to do with your life"
"If you're fine, you don't have to do anything about it What a flimsy and feeble word! If you're crappy, say you're lousy! Tell the truth! Tell the truth! I'm so angry. Here we are at a conference about being alive"
"Mel Robbins: The bigger issue with fine is that you say it to yourself. Robbins: That thing that you want, you've convinced yourself that you're fine not having it. You have lifechanging ideas for a reason, and it's not to torture yourself, she says."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about the power of the inner snooze button He says that when you have ideas that could change the world, you hit the snoozing button. Defterio: No one's coming, motivation isn't happening, you're never going to feel like it"
Do you know that a third of Americans feel dissatisfied with their lives right now? Do you think they ever feel like eating boiled chicken and peas instead of a croissant? I don't think so!

"phthalmologist: It's a little bit like people think of spelling or singing. They think,You can either do it, or you can't. I think we'll call him Jeff, he says. We'll have some fun with the hair, watch."
"phthalmologist: I think it's more to do with beliefs rather than talent and ability (Laughter) We'll do one more. One more go. Here we go. You're getting the idea We're doing little variations on the same thing, he says. But I think you can"

"The artist was asked to draw a group of people who have suffered strokes. The group was part of a charity called TALK, which helps people with aphasia. The charity is a wonderful charity that helps people who've suffered strokes, but have a particular condition known as aphasiania."
"Stroke is a condition that can lead to a loss of confidence for sufferers. It can be difficult for people to read, write, speak or understand. To overcome this, stroke sufferers need to be able to write and speak with their left hand."
"David's stroke meant that it affected the right side of his body, and he drew with his left hand. David: It was an inspirational session for me. It was quite a humbling session, one of the best things I felt I've ever done"
phthalmologist: Many of you didn't believe you could draw. How many other beliefs and limiting thoughts do we all carry around with us every day? Beliefs that we could perhaps potentially challenge and think differently about. He asks: How many beliefs do we carry with us that we might be able to change?
"Women have been forbidden to play the drums in most African cultures. The drum is a very sensual instrument. Women have been brainwashed into believing they are not good enough to play it. Women should not be afraid of playing the drum, but should be encouraged to learn."
"The traditional African drum is disappearing from the music scene. The drummers are often women, who fear the physical pain of playing the drum. We are born to bring life to the world, says the drummers' leader. The drum is the most powerful tool we have to fight for our future"
"Women drummers have led countries, won Grammys and played the drum to a fivestar rating. As a child, she beat plates, shakers, drums, pans and so much more to become a professional drummer and percussionist. The vibrating eardrum jerks a bone called the hammer, which hits the anvil and moves the third bone."
"When a sound makes the basilar membrane vibrate, not every hair cell moves  only selected ones, depending on the frequency of the sound. At one end, the membrane is stiff, vibrating only in response to short wavelength, highfrequency sounds. The other is more flexible, vibrated only in the presence of longer wavelength, lowfrequency Sounds."
Hearing loss is the third most common  chronic disease in the world. The ability to recognize sounds and identify their location is possible thanks to the auditory system. The ears task is to convert sound energy into neural signals; the brain's is to receive and process those signals.
"Even in people with completely unimpaired senses, the brain constructs the world we perceive from incomplete information. The fullblown hallucinations of Charles Bonnet Syndrome are one example. People with hearing loss often hallucinate music or voices, sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony of an entire marching band."
Hallucinations associated with schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those caused by LSD and psilocybin. Patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels of serotonin in the brain. antipsychotic drugs relieve symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin  receptors LSD andpsilocy bin bind to.
"Historians located the Amazon homeland in Scythia, the vast territory stretching from the Black Sea across  the steppes of Central Asia. Their culture flourished for about 1,000 years beginning around 800 BC. Women hunted and fought alongside men, using the same weapons."
"Until recently, no one was sure how strong the links were between the Amazons and the Scythians. More than 1,000 ancient kurgans, or burial mounds, have been found. About 300 of the bodies belong to women, and more are being found every year."
Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber and a magnetic field draws them towards the center. A laser beam aimed at the middle of the chamber is tuned to just the right frequency that an atom moving towards it will absorb a photon of the laser beam and slow down. A magnetooptical trap like this can cool atoms down to just a few microkelvins.
"Cold atoms hold enormous potential for probing the frontiers of physics. With so little energy, theyre incredibly sensitive to fluctuations in the environment. Their extreme sensitivity makes them candidates to be used to detect gravitational waves in future spacebased detectors. Ultracold atoms have already allowed scientists to study BoseEinstein condensation."
"Scientists have found a way to slow atoms down with a laser beam. The beams momentum can stall  moving atoms, cooling them down. Stress resilience is the active biological process that allows us to bounce back after stress. insufficient resilience can result in a psychiatric disorder, such as depression."
"Depression and PTSD are chronic, often lifelong, clinical diseases. They also increase the risk of substance abuse, homelessness, heart disease, Alzheimer's, suicide. The global cost of depression alone is over three trillion dollars per year. This is the first time a drug has been shown to prevent the negative effects of stress."
"The first vaccine was discovered in 1798, but it was only for smallpox. Now scientists have discovered drugs that could prevent depression and PTSD. The drugs work by increasing stress resilience, so let's call them resilience enhancers. They are a whole new class of drug that could have a huge impact."
"During puberty, your larynx grows in size, elongating the vocal folds and opening up more room for them to vibrate. These longer folds have slower,  larger vibrations, which result in a lower baseline pitch. After puberty, most peoples voices remain more or less the same for about 50 years. But eventually we experience the symptoms associated with aging larynxes, known as presbyphonia."
"When kept in good condition, your voice box is a finely tuned instrument, capable of operatic arias, moody monologues, and speeches. The specific sound of a speaking voice is the result of many anatomical variables, but its mostly determined by the age and health of our vocal cords."
"Smoking can cause cancer in multiple tissues and organs, as well as damaged eyesight and weakened bones. But for those who quit smoking, theres a huge positive upside with almost immediate and longlasting physical benefits. Let's look at what happens as their ingredients make their way through our bodies, and how we benefit."
"Quitting can lead to anxiety and depression, resulting from nicotine withdrawal. But fortunately,  such effects are usually temporary. And quitting is getting easier, thanks to a growing arsenal of tools. Nicotine replacement therapy through gum, skin patches, lozenges, and sprays."
"The Library of Alexandria housed an unprecedented number of scrolls and attracted some of the Greek worlds greatest minds. For about 300 years after its founding in 283 BCE, the library thrived. But then, in 48 BCE, Julius Caesar laid siege to Alexandria and set the ships in the harbor on fire."
"The Library of Alexandria was built in the 5th century CE by Alexander the Great. The idea for the library came from Alexander, who wanted to build an empire of knowledge in his namesake city. Ptolemy I began to fill the library with primarily Greek and Egyptian scrolls."
"In this posthuman world, local has a new meaning. Our cities are full of imported plants, which now run wild across their adopted homes. As sunken skyscrapers add crumbled concrete to the new forest floor, the soil acidity plummets, potentially allowing new plant life to thrive."
"Humanity hasn't always been here, and we won't be here forever. But even after several million years, humanitys legacy lives on. By investigating the world without us, perhaps we can learn more about the world we live in now."
People who are highly skilled tend to think others are just as skilled. This can spiral into feelings that they dont deserve accolades and opportunities over other people. The most surefire way  to combat imposter syndrome is to talk about it.
"Psychologist Pauline Rose Clance was the first to study this unwarranted sense of insecurity. She and her patients experienced something that goes by a number of names imposter phenomenon, imposter experience, and imposter syndrome. The same thing has been established across gender, race, age, and a huge range of occupations."
"The act of remembering relies on the prefrontal cortex, which governs thought,  attention, and reasoning. The act of trying to remember can itself be a stressor, leading to a vicious cycle of more corticosteroid release and an even smaller chance of remembering."
"Deep breathing exercises have shown measurable reduction in test anxiety in groups ranging from third graders to nursing students. Completing practice questions under time pressure, or seated at a desk rather than on a couch, can make your stress response less sensitive during the test."
"In 1130, Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote The History of the Kings of Britain He cobbled together fragments of myth and poetry to compensate for the lack of official records. A few of his sources contained  mentions of Arthur, and some others were realistic accounts of battles."
"King Arthur as we know him is a creation of the later Middle Ages, but his legend actually has its roots in Celtic poetry from an earlier time. After the Romans left Britain in 410 CE, Saxon invaders from whats now Germany and Denmark capitalized on the vulnerability of the abandoned territory."
"Edgar Allan Poe was one of the most versatile and experimental writers of the nineteenth century. He invented the detective story as we know it, with The Murders in the Rue Morgue, followed by The Mystery of Marie Roget Poe also wrote satires of social  and literary trends, and hoaxes that anticipated science fiction."
"Poes short stories explore the dark side of human nature. The author was inspired by his mother and father, who died in poverty. His stories are known for their macabre realism and dark humour. They are also famous for their use of the Middle English alphabet."
"Chaucer spent most of his life as a government official during the Hundred Years' War. This may have influenced the panoramic vision of his work, and in the Tales, no level of society is above mockery. While the narrative runs  to over 17,000 lines, it's apparently unfinished, as the prologue introduces 29 pilgrims."
Middle English was used between the 12th and 15th centuries. It evolved from Old English due to increased contact with European romantic languages. Cemeteries like the 110acre PreLachaise in Paris were lushly landscaped gardens.
"Cities like London, New York, and Hong Kong are running out of burial space. Traditional burial consumes materials like metal, stone, and concrete, and can pollute soil and groundwater with toxic chemicals. With increasing awareness of the  environmental costs, people are seeking alternatives."
"The first known burials about 120,000 years ago were likely reserved for transgressors. Still others were sunk in lakes, put out to sea, ritually cannibalized, or cremated. All of these practices, though some may seem strange today, were ways of venerating the dead."
"We're not looking that hard, and we're spending a pitiful amount of money on it. Maybe we are the first such civilization in our galaxy. Or, perhaps, civilization carries with it the seeds of its own destruction through the inability to control the technologies it creates."
"SETI, the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence, is now releasing its data to the public so that millions of citizen scientists can bring the power of the crowd to join the search. In the past year, the Kepler space observatory has found hundreds of planets just around nearby stars."
"Physicists say there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles. The leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. Some physicists think the spacetime continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of socalled pocket universes."
Physicists believe there is only one universe. The Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us.
"If we fold a piece of paper 25 times, the thickness is almost a quarter of a mile. That would make it almost as tall as the Empire State Building. If we fold the same paper 45 times, it would reach 6.5 miles."
"CNN's John Sutter asks: How much thickness can a piece of paper get if it's folded over and over? He says the answer is about a thousandth of a centimeter. Sutter: If we fold the paper again and again, the thickness of the paper would increase by a centimetre."
"Sea turtles have been around since the late Jurassic, roughly 150 million years ago. Of those that began as eggs on a distant beach, now less than 10 percent remain. Human endeavors, from beach development to plastic refuse to poaching, long lines, nets, and even noxious chemicals, including oil, have upped the ante."
"Every living adult sea turtle has overcome the odds, as a consequence of chance, skill, and capability. Of the 50 to 200 eggs laid, roughly 20 percent will never hatch. The surviving eggs hatch, and the young turtles squirm to the surface, emerging from the sand."
"If you had a mole of basketballs, you could create a new planet the size of Earth. If you received a Mole of pennies on the day you were born, you would still have 99.99% of your money in the bank when you died."
"A mole is a concept that we use in chemistry to count molecules, atoms, just about anything extremely small. For a chemist, a mole conjures up the number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd, not a fuzzy little animal. In 1811, someone had the idea that equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, would contain an equal number of particles."
Avogadro's work helped lay the foundation for the atomic theory. Metaphors get under your skin by ghosting right past the logical mind. Some metaphors include the words like or as These are called similes. Similes tend to make you think.
I saw no way out is one of the most famous poems of the 20th century. The poem was written by the Japanese poet Shigetake Sato. Sato's poem is about life in a small town in Japan. He says the town is full of people who want to live in the moment.
"A good metaphor isn't a puzzle, or a way to convey hidden meanings. Metaphors are handles on the door of what we can know, and ofwhat we can imagine. By making a handle, you can make a world that only that one handle can open."
"A metaphor isn't true or untrue in any ordinary sense. A metaphor that isn't good leaves you confused. You know what it means to feel like a square wheel, but not what it's like to be tired as a whale. We don't really stop to think about a raindrop the size of an actual dog."
"In the real world, businesses are free to compete with marketing strategies, by differentiating their product line, and with price cuts. But at the heart of their strategy, companies like to keep their competition as close as possible. Why do grocery stores, auto repair shops and restaurants always seem to exist in groups instead of being spread evenly?"
"Game theorists consider this a socially optimal solution. The onehalfmile walk may be too far for some people at each end of the beach, but your cart serves as many people as possible. On the seventh and final rung, we take action based on our adjusted beliefs."
"The Ladder of Inference, which was first proposed by Harvard professor Chris Argyris, is the basis of this model. We feel angry, frustrated, vindictive, justified. We adjust our beliefs based on the experience. And finally our last rung: we take action."
"Every time we interact with someone, that experience enters the ladder at the bottom. Next time you notice yourself reacting to your experience, pay focused attention to your ladder. Ask yourself what beliefs are at play, where do they come from? What data and observations did you filter in as a result of your beliefs?"
"We all have our own unique ladder. Be mindful of yours, and help others to see theirs. That same experience zips up the ladder in the blink of an eye, exiting at the top. This process happens thousands of times a day without us knowing it."
"The walls of Constantinople were built by the Romans to stop the advance of the Turks. The walls were built to withstand the threat of a largescale attack. The wall was finally breached in 1453 by the forces of the Roman Emperor, Constantine II."
Constantinople was the capital of the Roman Empire. The walls were built to protect the city from attack. The city was 20 times the size of London or Paris at the time. It was also the center of learning for the ancient world.
"Zombies can't communicate, but they don't seem to do a good job of understanding things either. This is caused by damage  to the inferior frontal gyrus, or possibly the anterior insula, both regions behind your temple on the left side of your head. Damage to an area at the junction of two of the brains lobes is the culprit."
"The patient's behavior is similar to that of a person with Parkinson's disease. The patient is stiff legged, with long, lumbering steps,  very slow and awkward. The large gaping bite mark on its shoulder might have something  to do with it."
"Gerrymandering is the process of drawing district lines and packing in your opponents like cattle, into as few districts as possible. Packing, then, decreases the opponent's voter strength and influence. Cracking is the opposite: taking one district and cracking it into several pieces."
"Gerrymandering is the process of redrawing district lines to give one party an advantage. The process began in Massachusetts in 1812 when Governor Gerry redrew the lines to help his party win more seats in the state Senate. The more members of your party who vote, the more likely you are to win an election. Politicians think of creative ways to draw districts."
"Gerrymandering is the process of dividing up and redrawing districts to give your political party an advantage. It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states."
"There are certain states that have a long history of voting for a particular party. These are known as safe states States that are teetering between between parties are called swing states In the past four election cycles, Ohio and Florida have been swing states."
"The number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress. The census is conducted every 10 years, so every time the census happens, states might gain or lose a few electoral votes. The Democratic candidate and Republican candidate are each trying to add up the electors in every state."
The universe contains about 100 billion stars. Many of those stars have planets orbiting them. Finding planets of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning. We also want to know about the makeup of their atmospheres. We've discovered microbes living in all sorts of extreme environments.
Scientists say Earthlike planets may be only the tip of the iceberg. They think there could be billions of other worlds with life that we don't know about. The only way to find out is to go to them and look for them.
"Water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it. Life needs water in the form of liquid, not ice, and not vapor. For a planet to have liquid water at its surface, three things are important. The planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity keeps the water molecules from flying off into space."
"The antihero is not the villain, not the antagonist, but the main character in some contemporary works of literature. In the tales of Guy Montag and Winston Smith, lie the warnings of contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fears: that we are not strong enough to defeat the monsters."
"Stress hormones increase inflammation in the body, suppress the immune system, and can even increase oil production in the skin. And this is the perfect storm for forming a pimple. Stressful situations are unavoidable. But we can try to change our responses so that we're not so stressed in the end."
"Stress is a general biological response to a potential danger. In primitive caveman terms, stress can make you fight for your life. Special chemicals called stress hormones run through your body, giving you more oxygen and power to run away from danger or to face it."
"Think about what your character would do if they were on a bus with you. An older person might speak differently than a younger person. Someone from the south might speak different to someone from the north. When you speak your character's words, you can hear whether they sound natural."
"How to Hear Voices in Your Head is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at writing dialogue. This week, we look at antisocial skills  making friends, solving conflicts, being pleasant and polite. We also look at how to write dialogue, or fictional dialogue."
"An atom of ekaaluminum has an atomic weight of 68, about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom. A cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams. Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was, and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave."
"Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, died in 1907. He predicted elements that were unknown at the time: scandium, germanium, rhenium. In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element. This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101."
Dmitri Mendeleev was the first person to arrange elements with similar properties together. The first version of the periodic table from around 1870 shows elements designated by their twoletter symbols. The Lord's Prayer looks like what it would look like in Old English.
"In 1066, the Norman conquest brought war again to the British Isles. The Normans abandoned the Viking language and culture in favor of a French lifestyle. For three centuries, French was the language of the British royalty. The French also brought many Roman Catholic clergymen with them."
"Cordial and welcome are both Saxon words. The connotation of nobility and authority has persisted around words of French origin. Even if you never heard this history before, the memory of it persists in the feelings evoked by the words you speak."
"In the year 400 C.E. the Celts in Britain were ruled by Romans. The Romans protected them from the barbarian Saxon tribes of Northern Europe. With the Romans gone, the Germanic tribes, the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians quickly sailed across the water. For several centuries, these tribes lived in Britain, and their Germanic language, Anglo Saxon, became the common language."
"Cancer hijacks cells' natural division machinery and forces them to put the pedal to the metal, growing rapidly and recklessly. The more frequently a cell divides, the more likely the drug is to kill it. The list of unpleasant side effects of cancer treatment parallels these tissue types."
"Cell division is an intricate chemical dance that's part individual, part communitydriven. In a neighborhood of 100 trillion cells, some times things go wrong. Most of the time, the cell senses mistakes and shuts itself down. But enough mutations can bypass the failsafes, driving the cell to divide recklessly."
"Roxanne Jones: Imitation is not the same as reality She says that when we see something that is not what we expect, it's not ironic. Jones: We should be able to laugh at ourselves, not laugh at the situation."
"There are only two base words in all of English that have the letters doub: one is doubt, and the other is double. Historically, before English began to borrow words from French, it already had a word for doubt: tweogan"
"The word doubt started as a Latin word, dubitare It first moved from Latin into French where it lost both its buh sound and its letter b About 100 years later, scribes who wrote English but also knew Latin, started to reinsert the  b into the word's spelling."
"Life has color. The lowest frequency light that we can see is red and the highest frequency is purple. Blue things reflect blue light, red things reflect red light and so on. White objects reflect all colors of light, while black things do exactly the opposite and absorb at all frequencies."
"Using a stopwatch, you measure the time it takes for the piece of cork to go over its highest position down to its lowest and then back up again. The cork traces the same path over and over again... up and down. This repetitive or periodic motion is characteristic of waves."
"The food we eat also influences which microbes live in our gut. For example, food made of complex molecules, like an apple, requires a lot of different microbial workers to break it down. But, if a food is made of simple molecules,like a lollipop, some of these workers are put out of a job."
"When you see a color, each cone sends its own distinct signal to your brain. There are three kinds of cone cells that roughly correspond to the colors red, green, and blue. Your brain receives the same signal regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies."
"There are infinitely many different physical colors, but, because we only have three kinds of cones, the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color. This property of human vision is really useful in the real world. For example, TV manufacturers only have to put three: red, green, and blue, which is lucky for them."
"The musketeers huddled and formulated a plan. They would attack in sequence, but who should go first? They bickered for a while, the dragon ate a few more princesses, and then they finally agreed. Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction, each in turn, always the same order."
"Once upon a time in the magical and very round Land of Pi, there lived six swashbuckling musketeers. Their names were Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. But each was known best by his or her mark: the small and raised digits of Exponents."
"Newton believed that light is made up of tiny, atomlike particles, which he called corpuscles. Scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years figuring out the answer to this question. In the 19th century, long after Newton died, scientists did a series of experiments that clearly showed that light can't be made up. Only waves make interference patterns, particles don't."
"Light behaves like a particle and a wave, but not exactly like either. Ancient Greeks thought light originated in our eyes and sent out probes to gather information. The idea is that very few objects, like the sun, actually emit their own light."
"There are three types of irony out there. Dramatic irony is when the audience seems to know more about an event, a situation, or a conversation than the characters in the movie, on the show, or in the book do. Situational irony is When you expect one thing, but get the opposite. Verbal irony isWhen someone says something, but truly means the opposite of what they say."
"OkCupid asks users questions like, Do you want to have kids one day? and How often do you brush your teeth? The questions are good for matching like with like, that is, when both people answer the same way. But if both people in a relationship are saying yes, they're going to have massive problems."
"For every question, we ask you to tell us how important the question is to you. We then use that information to create an algorithm to match you with someone. For example, a question like Which is worse: book burning or flag burning? could be very important."
"Dating site is now one of the biggest dating sites in the United States. As a very simple example, we use a small set s with just two questions in common. Here are our two example questions: How messy are you and Do you like to be the center of attention?"
OkCupid's matching algorithm helps us decide whether two people should go on a date. Irrelevant is worth 0; a little important is worth 1. Very important is 50; absolutely mandatory is 250. The algorithm makes two simple calculations: How much did B's answers satisfy you?
"The algorithm multiplies your scores, then takes the nth root, where n is the number of questions. It's a mathematical expression of how happy you'd be with each other, based on what we know. The algorithm is a great way to combine values that have wide ranges and represent very different properties."
"An algorithm is just a systematic, stepbystep way to solve a problem. An algorithm can take realworld phenomena and make them something a microchip can understand. Any time OkCupid matches two people, it goes through the steps outlined."
"There are two main components in operant conditioning: reinforcement and punishment. Reinforcers make it more likely that you'll do something again, while punishers make it less likely. Operant conditioning explains how consequences lead to changes in voluntary behavior."
"In the 1890s, a Russian man taught his dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell. He did this by showing them pictures of Picasso and Van Gogh. Today, the same technique is used to teach children to read."
"classical conditioning works in the same way in humans as it does in animals. You place the different alleles on both axes and then figure out the possible combinations. Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example. The dominant yellow allele is an uppercase Y and the recessive green allele is a lowercase y"
"Gregor Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants. By breeding the pea plants he was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles that rule heredity. These days scientists know how you inherit characteristics from your parents."
"Mendel: Verbal irony is where what is meant is the opposite of what is said, while sarcasm adds that little punch of attitude. Mendel: Not all sarcasm is sarcastic, and not all verbal irony is sarcastic."
"When someone says, Great weather we're having, it is quite possible that the person really means that if the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the wind is calm. Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines, they very well may be compliments. They may also be, though, pointed and attacking lines."
"This is verbal irony when the speaker says the opposite of what he means. The conditions were harsh and many deaths were caused by exposure, malaria, and amoebic dysentery. Getting lost, starving to death, and the possibility of attacks by wild tigers or bears were constant threats."
"The Ho Chi Minh Trail was the key to Hanoi's success in the Vietnam War. Villages along the trail organized teams to guarantee traffic flow and to help drivers repair damage caused by air attacks. The trail was a network of tracks, dirt roads, and river crossings."
"In 1959, a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltrate soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam. Today, things are largely made up of atoms, but hundreds of seconds after the Big Bang, it was too hot for electrons to join atomic nuclei to make atoms."
The Big Bang was the creation of the universe as we know it. Astronomers have been trying to explain how the universe came to be since the Big Bang in 4.5 billion years ago. The Big Bang is thought to have been caused by the formation of the first stars.
"Cameras are allowing us to see a beautiful world through new eyes. In classrooms today, the camera allows the youngest scientists to observe the world around them. Sometimes cameras can help us see matter or movements that are too small for the naked eye."
"Many people think they know what they are talking about when they don't, says John Sutter. Sutter: It's important to be able to distinguish between what we know and what we don't. He says we should trust our instincts when making decisions about the future."
"We judge people by their actions, not by their words. Even the most respected people can be wrong. The world is full of people who don't know what they are doing. We should be able to trust our instincts to tell us what we should do."
"Feathers evolved over millions of years into their modern form. They are gorgeous in their complexity, delicate in their construction, and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air. Only then, perhaps 50 million years after the first wiry feathers evolved, did feathers lift those dinosaurs into the sky."
"Scientists have found dozens of species of dinosaurs with remnants of feathers. Some were as small as pigeons, and some were the size of a school bus. In many dinosaur lineages, these simple feathers evolved into more intricate ones. All the stuff that's made of atoms is visible."
"There's simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies to provide enough gravity to hold them together. The discovery of dark matter took us one step further away from the center of things. Most scientists think it's the former, that there's some kind of energy driving the acceleration."
"Supersymmetry, or SUSY for short, predicts a whole range of new particles, some of which could make up the dark matter. If we found evidence for SUSy, we could go from understanding 5% of our universe, the things we can actually see, to around a third."
"Greece's Leucippus of Miletus came up with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever. His theory is simple and elegant, and it has the advantage over the earth, air, fire, and water theory of being right. But it didn't predict anything that could be measured, and measurement is the basis of experimental science."
"Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked with spinning the wool that will be used to weave a mighty garment, 30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape. The Romans loved the idea that their wives work wool. Unlike women in Greece, Roman women go out the house and move about the city."
"Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married in two years to darling Philatus, isn't ready. She has an older brother who is fourteen, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, named after her dad. While as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls that mirror the image of their sister."
"The Porticus of Livia was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus. It was built on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio, who once tried to feed a slave to the eels in his fish pond."
"Pregnant teenager, age 15, comes to dinner with her family. She has proved that she is a successful wife by bringing children and descendants for her husband. The family head off to the dining room and are served dinner. It would seem Dad has had an invite to dinner elsewhere."
"The Romans were too. confused about who was married to whom when they came to write it down. We are constantly asked for our opinions. We want to hear from people of all ages, races, and geographic regions. If you only asked people in Idaho, where the state food is the potato, chances are that you would get a much different answer than those in New Mexico."
"Polls that are too hard can't tell you much either. Interviewer bias is all about the effect that the person asking the questions has on the sample. People worry that their answers may make them look bad. People tend to give socially desirable responses, not necessarily their honest opinions."
"Despite their flaws, public opinion polls provide us with some sense of the thoughts and moods of large groups of people. The problem is public opinion isn't easy to track and, often times, isn't even right. Next time you get a phone call asking your opinion, or if you see a poll online, take some time to think about who is asking and why they're asking."
The art form of Gyotaku was popular in Japan during the Edo period. The prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen. Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error. The artist places the fish on a hollowed out surface and pins them down to dry.
Gyo means to print in Japanese. It is a way to show the size of a fish. The artist uses cotton or silk to make the print. The fish is then released into the water. The print is then signed by the artist.
The first prints like this were for records only with no extra details. The gene heightens normally occurring connections between the taste area in his frontal lobe and the color area further back. The amazing thing is that a single nucleotide change in the sequence of one's DNA alters perception.
"Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that couples two or more senses in 4% of the population. Having one type, such as colored hearing, gives you a 50% chance of having a second, third, or fourth type. Some synesthetes even have gender or personality differences."
"In the 1580s, an Italian friar, Giordano Bruno, suggested the stars were suns that likely had their own planets. In the 1920s, astronomers studying the nebuli wanted to figure out how they were moving. They expected to see blue shift for objects moving toward us, and red shift for ones moving away."
"Aristotle believed the sun was at the center of the universe. The Big Bang was an explosion in space and time, not a point in the sky. The universe is still expanding, and we don't know what's out there."
"Some superheroes can grow to the size of a building at will. Density is defined as mass divided by volume. The human body is made out of bones and flesh, which has a relatively set density. In option one, if the hero weighs 200 pounds all the time, then he would be bones andlesh at normal size."
"The Law of Conservation of Mass implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, which means that our hero's mass will not change just because his size changes. He would need to consume 27 times 3,000 calories of food every day."
"The human body consists of 65% oxygen, 18% carbon, 10% hydrogen, and 7% of various other elements including 0.002% of silicon. In a chemical reaction, the elements recombine to make new compounds. Nuclear fusion requires so much heat, the only natural occurrence of this process is in stars."
"At 25,000 miles per hour, we would have gone past the nearest wall or through it by over a mile. Newton's First Law of Motion deals with inertia, which is the resistance to a change in its state of motion. It's the acceleration or sudden stop that causes our internal organs to crash into the front of our bodies."
"Physicists say running over a girl is the same as running her over with a space shuttle at maximum speed. Air is not empty. Elements like oxygen and nitrogen, even countless dust particles, make up the air around us. When we move past these things in the air, we're rubbing against them."
"It takes us approximately onefifth of a second to react to what we see. It's not the fall that kills her, but the sudden stop at the bottom. If you could fly, what you must do is fly up to her, start flying down at the speed she is falling, hold on to her."
"The pressure on a person's body is proportional to the size of the area it is in contact with. This is why we can lift heavy objects without breaking our skin, but a tiny needle can make us bleed with just a little poke. This can be explained by Darwin's theory of evolution."
"Immortality doesn't automatically translate to invincibility, it just means you cannot die. Women find taller men more attractive, then more tall men would mate and have children, putting more tall genes in the gene pool. Repeat that process for a million years and the average height will be a lot taller."
"If you've been alive for over one million years, the odds of still having all your limbs are pretty slim. To a tenyearold boy, one year is the same as 10% of his life. The same year, 365 days, can feel differently to different people. If this boy lives for 30,000 years, a year to him could feel like a day."
We don't remember what we did when we were five years old. We don't have the same memory as we do now. We can't go back in time. We have to go forward. We need to move forward in time to make up for lost time.
"The world record for fastest shortdistance sprint speed is roughly 27 miles per hour. The Ideal Gas Law implies that as the pressure decreases, gas volume increases. If you were to fly straight up too quickly, the inert gas in your body would rapidly expand the way soda fizzes up when shaken."
"According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, force is the product of mass times acceleration. Running speed depends on how much force is exerted by the runner's legs. Michael Phelps is currently the fastest human in water and the most decorated Olympian of all time."
"If you are invisible, you can't see because there is no light to reflect off your skin. Dust on your skin is caused by dead skin cells, soil particles and cotton fibers. If you're invisible, people would see a humanshaped blob of dust."
"Invisibility means you can't be seen by others and also cannot see. Scientists have created metamaterials to guide rays of light around tiny, twodimensional objects. Cameras can also film what is behind you and project the image so you appear invisible from the front."
"If you are truly invisible, as in from within, here are a few problems you may not have thought about before. To move around undetected by other people, you would have to be totally naked. Drivers and people on the street can't see you either, therefore they can and will run into you."
"Evolution is not about selecting which genes are best to preserve. Random mutations cause organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. There is no predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form."
"Commas are tricky things, especially when subordinates and conjunctions are involved. The comma asks the subordinates if they need help. They might not want to admit it, but this time the subordinates do need help, says the author. The author then asks the subordinate if he needs help. The subordinate is appalled at the idea of needing assistance."
"If you can remember a few basic rules, a simple law of physics, and some common scenarios, you will be able to use commas correctly. When subordinates begin sentences, the comma will place herself directly after the first thought or complete sentence. Fanboys are courteous creatures. They allow the comma to go ahead of them."
"Conjunctions are words that connect clauses, words, and phrases. Subordinates make it very clear what is being prioritized in a sentence. The conjunction assures the comma that help isn't needed, which is good for the comma because by now, all it wants to do is go home."
"pi is used to calculate the area under a normal distribution curve. It's also used in particle physics experiments, such as those using the Large Hadron Collider. Historians aren't sure when or how this number was first discovered, but it's been known in some form for 4,000 years."
"The Vitruvian Man is one of the most recognizable symbols of the Renaissance. It was created by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. The sketch shows a man who can take any shape he pleases. It is thought that by changing the position of the man, he can fill the irreconcilable areas of a circle and a square."
"Leonardo's sketch places a man firmly at the center of a circle and a square. Leonardo used the ideas of Vitruvius to solve the problem of squaring a circle metaphorically. The problem is impossible to solve because of the nature of pi, but that's another story."
"Dyslexia affects up to one in five people. One person might have mild dyslexia while the next person has a profound case. The brain is divided into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere is generally in charge of language and, ultimately, reading. The right typically handles spatial activities."
"Dyslexia is caused by a phonological processing problem, meaning people affected by it have trouble not with seeing language but with manipulating it. Neurodiversity emphasizes this spectrum of brain function in all humans and suggests that to better understand the perspectives of those around us, we should try to understand them through their brains."
"A grand piano, for example, can play 88 separate notes. We use something called a clef, a weirdlooking figure placed at the beginning of the staff. It acts like a reference point, telling you that a particular line or space corresponds to a specific note on your instrument."
"The time signature of a piece of music tells a performer how many beats are in each bar. The bottom number tells us what kind of note is to be used as the basic unit for the beat. One corresponds to a whole note, two to a half note, four to a quarter note, and eight to an eighth note."
"Music is written on five parallel lines that go across the page. These five lines are called a staff, and a staff operates on two axes: up and down and left to right. The upanddown axis tells the performer the pitch of the note or what note to play."
"In Old English, more than one lamb was lambru, and people talked not about breads, but breadru. And just like today, we have oxen instead of oxes. So, why didn't things stay the way they were? In a word, Vikings."
"English used to be an even harder language to learn than it is today. If you were speaking English before about a thousand years ago, beek is exactly what you would have said for more than one book. Thank the ancestors of people in Copenhagen and Oslo for the fact that today we don't ask for peanight instead of peanuts."
"Sarcophagus is a stone coffin typically adorned with decorative carvings or inscriptions. The Greek word sarkophagus was used to describe the limestone that a coffin was made of, not the coffin itself. The word came from the Greek words sark, meaning flesh, and phagein, a verb meaning to eat."
President Kennedy realized that catching up to the Soviets wasn't going to cut it. He announced the goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s. They succeeded in this through the Apollo program with Neil Armstrong taking his famous step in 1969.
"The world's first satellite, the R7, was launched on October 4, 1957. It was the first satellite to carry a nuclear warhead into space. The world's secondlargest planet, Antarctica, is the world's coldest continent."
"The North and South Pole are very important climate controllers. They help moderate the temperature in our temperate zones and give us stable weather. As sea ice in the Arctic declines due to climate change and global warming, weather around the globe becomes increasing more unstable."
"The North Pole is in the middle of an ocean covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice. Average winter temperatures can be as low as 40 degrees Celsius. Despite these incredibly harsh conditions, humans have populated areas in the Arctic for thousands of years."
"Some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul is just biology's way to make you continue our species. The person comes to satisfy a physiological craving, and you want more. But then sometimes, slowly or suddenly, you don't. You've fallen out of love, become unaddicted."
"Love is a construct, not a real thing. No two people's love is the same. Love can be scientific, emotional, legal, or personal. Love is not something that can be defined. It's a feeling. It is not a thing."
"Love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing in all of human history. Despite centuries upon centuries of obsession, it still overwhelms us. Some say it's a feeling, a magical emotion, a feeling for someone like you've never felt before."
Dothraki came hot on the heels of the real language that the Na'vi speak in Avatar The Elvish varieties Tolkien fleshed out the most are Quenya and Sindarin. Their words are different in the same way French and Spanish are.
"The languages of the Lord of the Rings universe are called Elvish and Dothraki The languages were created by J.R. R. Tolkien, but they are now spoken by people around the world. The languages are more complex than just a few words."
"In English, to make a verb past, you add an ed. In Elvish, wash is allu and washed is 'allune' In the 18th and 19th centuries, English uniformitarian geologists, James Hutton and Charles Lyell, studied current, slow rates of erosion and sedimentation."
"Darwin's theory of evolution is still relevant today. He found a duct in animal skulls that sends saliva to the mouth. It could be the first sign of human evolution, or a sign of a new way of looking at the world. It may also be a clue to the origin of life."
"The origin of the word robot dates back more than a thousand years to the era of serfdom in central Europe. In 1920, Czech writer Karel Capek published a science fiction play called R.U.R., short for Rossum's Universal Robots The story featured automated machines with distinctly human features that catered to the whims of the people of Earth."
"R.U.R. was wildly successful, and when it was translated into English in 1923, the word robot was enthusiastically embraced. At 144 degrees, changes begin in the proteins, which come mostly from the eggs in your dough. Water boils away at 212 degrees, so like mud baking in the sun, your cookie gets dried out and it stiffens."
"Caramelization is what happens when sugar molecules break down under high heat. The Maillard reaction produces a range of flavor and aroma compounds, which also react with each other, forming even more complex tastes and smells. Caramelization starts at 356 degrees and continues up to 390 degrees."
"When the dough reaches 92 degrees Fahrenheit, the butter inside melts, causing the dough to start spreading out. As the butter melts, its trapped water is released. And as the cookie gets hotter, the water expands into steam. An estimated 142,000 Americans are infected this way each year."
"Some people are born without a sense of smell, others lose it after an accident or during an illness. The inability to smell a scent is called anosmia, and there are about 100 known examples. For some people, the chemical androstenone smells like vanilla; to others, it smells like sweaty urine."
"As an adult, you can distinguish about 10,000 different smells. Without the ability to smell, you cannot taste anything more complicated than sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and savory. The next time you smell exhaust fumes, salty sea air, or roast chicken, you'll know exactly how you've done it."
"One out of every fifty of your genes is dedicated to your olfactory receptor neurons. Insects can contain up to 80% protein, the body's vital building blocks, and are also high in energyrich fat, fiber, and micronutrients like vitamins and minerals."
"The yellow beetle larvae are native to America and easy to farm. Insects can contain up to 50% protein, almost as much as in an equivalent amount of beef. Farming insects for food also has less environmental impact than livestock farms. Insect farms can be small scale, highly productive, and yet inexpensive to keep."
"In ancient Greece, cicadas were considered luxury snacks. Even the Romans found beetle larvae to be scrumptious. Almost 2,000 insect species are turned into food, forming a big part of everyday diets for two billion people around the world."
The author of the book The Secret of the World writes about his love of the written word. The book is about a man who creates a world out of his imagination. The author says the world he has created is based on the real world he lives in.
"Think about daytoday life. Who has power, and who doesn't? How do people treat their young and their old? What kind of technology exists? Transportation? Communication? Access to information? There's so much to think about! So, spend some time living in those tasks and the answers to those questions."
"The Law of Gravity holds seven book sets of Harry Potter to millions of bookshelves around the world. In J.R.R.'s world, the Valar are one of five people who guide the inhabitants of Middle Earth in their struggles against Sauron."
"At NASA, where astronauts are hurled into space at 17,000 miles per hour, motion sickness is a serious problem. The most common theory has to do with mismatched sensory signals. Perhaps one day the exact cause of motion sickness will be found, but that day is still on the horizon."
"In a car, your vestibular system correctly senses your movement, but your eyes don't see it. Scientists aren't sure, but they think there's an evolutionary explanation. For most of our history, there wasn't that much that could cause this sensory mixup."
"Euclid proved in 300 B.C.E. that there is an infinite quantity of prime numbers. The night manager assigns every current guest to the first prime number, 2, raised to the power of their current room number. The passengers on the second bus are assigned powers of the next prime, 5. The following bus, powers of 7."
"The Real Number Infinite Hotel has negative number rooms in the basement, fractional rooms. Georg Cantor called this level of infinity alephzero. Since there are an infinite number of rooms, there is a new room for each existing guest."
The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper are the world's two hottest peppers. The Scoville heat scale measures how much a pepper can be diluted before it is too hot for humans. Nobody knows when or why humans started eating hot peppers.
"Eating spicy food is like riding rollercoasters for some people. People who like to eat hot stuff are more likely to enjoy other adrenalinerich activities, like gambling. The taste for spicy food may even be genetic. Some studies show that spice developed mostly in warmer climates."
"Capsaicin and piperine, found in black pepper and chili peppers, are made up of larger, heavier molecules called alkylamides. Mustard, horseradish, and wasabi are made of smaller molecules, called isothiocyanates, that easily float up into your sinuses."
"The number of domesticated honeybees in the US has been decreasing at an alarming rate. Pesticides used both on commercial beehives and agricultural crops could be getting into the food and water that honeybees consume. Fewer bees overall means less pollination and higher food costs, so it's crucial that scientists solve the case of the vanishing bees."
"In 2006 such losses were found to affect more than half of all hives in the US. The phenomenon got a new name: colony collapse disorder. Scientists are learning that this detritus is an unexpectedly huge energy source, fueling most natural ecosystems."
"All species in an ecosystem, from the creatures in a coral reef to the fish in a lake to the lions on the savannah, are directly or indirectly nourished by dead stuff. The resulting food web is so connected that almost every species is no more than two degrees from detritus."
"In reallife terrestrial ecosystems, less than 10% of plant matter is eaten while it's still alive. The factorial of any positive integer is calculated as the product of that same integer and all smaller integers down to one. The number of ways four people can be arranged into chairs is written as four factorial, which equals 24."
"If a new permutation of 52 cards were written out every second starting 13.8 billion years ago, when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred, the writing would still be continuing today and for millions of years to come. There are more possible ways to arrange this simple deck of cards than there are atoms on Earth."
"Mathematicians and scientists care about symmetries. They're essential in many fields of math and science. The symmetry of the right and left sides of the human body is called bilateral symmetry. Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles and plants have this kind of symmetry."
"Bilaterally symmetric animals have bodies designed around movement. Having a head leads naturally to the development of bilateral symmetry. It also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish, aerodynamic wings if you are a bird, or well coordinated legs for running if you's a fox."
"Biologists say body symmetry can help them understand where we came from. Symmetry is a transformation that leaves an object unchanged. For biologists, this is strong evidence that we're more closely related to starfish than we are, to say, corals."
Pain signals are sent from the spinal cord to the brain's cortex. The cortex decides what to do with the pain signals. The brain also releases chemicals to help with pain. This is why some people are more sensitive to pain than others.
"Some people can cope with pain using distraction, relaxation, meditation, yoga, or strategies that can be taught. New treatments that directly stimulate or block certain painsensing attention are being developed. Figuring out how your brain responds to pain is the key to finding the best treatment for you."
"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Pain has an intensity; you can describe it on a scale from zero, no pain, to ten, the most pain imaginable. Pain also has a character, like sharp, dull, burning, or aching."
"While good journalism aims for objectivity, media bias is often unavoidable. Read coverage in multiple outlets which employ different reporters and interview different experts. Do a web search to find any additional information or context you might have missed and what others are saying about it."
"Revelations of covert wars, secret assassinations, and political corruption undermined public faith in official narratives presented by mainstream sources. This breakdown of trust in media gatekeepers lead to alternative newspapers, radio shows, and cable news competing with the major outlets and covering events from various perspectives."
"In his Meditations on First Philosophy, Ren Descartes tried to answer that very question. All his knowledge had come from his sensory perceptions of the world. You know you're watching this video with your eyes, hearing it with your ears. Your senses show you the world as it is."
"Brenda Milner's research redefined what memory even meant. H.M. couldn't form new memories, but retained information long enough to finish a sentence or find the bathroom. Without a hippocampus to perform this memory consolidation, they eroded like messages scrawled in sand."
"Henry Molaison, known as H.M, was a patient of Dr. William Scoville. His case provided amazing insights into how our brains work. H.M.'s brain was preserved and scanned before being cut into over 2000 individual slices."
"Musical repetition is deeply compelling. Repetition invites us into music as imagined participants, rather than as passive listeners. When people hear a segment of music repeated, they are more likely to move or tap along to it. Repeating a word like atlas ad nauseam can make you stop thinking about what the word means."
"Repetition gives rise to a kind of orientation to sound that we think of as distinctively musical. People will rate random sequences they've heard on repeated loop as more musical than a random sequence they've only heard once. The mereexposure effect doesn't just work for songs, it also works for shapes and Super Bowl ads."
"People rated the repetitive versions as more enjoyable, more interesting and more likely to have been composed by a human artist. They heard excerpts from these pieces in either their original form, or in a version that had been digitally altered to include repetition. The repetitive versions had been assembled by brute force audio editing."
"Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle was first stated by German physicist Werner Heisenberg back in 1927. The uncertainty isn't a matter of measuring well or badly, but an inevitable result of combining particle and wave nature. Particles, by definition, exist in one place at any instant in time. Waves, on the other hand, are disturbances spread out in space."
"The wavelength of a cat running from a physicist would be as small as an atom within that Solar System. That's far too small to detect, so we'll never see wave behavior from a cat. A tiny particle, like an electron, can show dramatic evidence of its dual nature."
"An electron in a molecule isn't on just atom A or atom B, but A+ B. The electrons in a solid aren't bound to a particular atom but shared among all of them. Understanding how electrons are shared among atoms allows us to precisely control the properties of semiconductor materials, like silicon. Combining different semiconductors in the right way allows to make transistors on a tiny scale."
"The quantum phenomenon of superposition is a consequence of the dual particle and wave nature of everything. In order for an object to have a wavelength, it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many positions at the same time. Since ancient times, mankind has hotly debated whether mathematics was discovered or invented."
"Theory of numbers has been around for centuries. But is it real, or is it just a way to explain the world around us? The answer may depend on how you look at it, but it's not a bad thing. It could be the answer to life itself."
Linguistic text analysis has helped to identify four common patterns in the subconscious language of deception. Lying is a language of abstract relationships based on patterns discerned by brains. Plato argued mathematical concepts were concrete and as real as the universe itself.
"We hear anywhere from 10 to 200 lies a day, and we spent much of our history coming up with ways to detect them. Many of the lies we encounter on a daily basis are far less serious that these examples, and may even be harmless. But it's still worthwhile to be aware of telltale clues, like minimal selfreferences, negative language and simple explanations."
"Lying can help you avoid an overvalued stock, an ineffective product, or even a terrible relationship. But most can be fooled with enough preparation, and none are considered reliable enough to even be admissible in court. What if the problem is not with the techniques, but the underlying assumption that lying spurs physiological changes?"
"After a deep cut or wound, the newly healed skin will look different from the surrounding area. It may not fully regain all its abilities for a while, or at all. To understand why this happens, we need to look at the structure of the human skin."
"African kingdoms prospered from the slave trade, but European's massive demand created intense competition. Slavery replaced other criminal sentences, and capturing slaves  became a motivation for war, rather than its result. The Atlantic slave trade brought more than 10 million Africans to the Americas."
"African kingdoms whose economies it had come to dominate collapsed, leaving them open to conquest and colonization. The Atlantic slave trade also contributed to the development of racist ideology. The impact it would leave affected not only these slaves and their descendants, but the economies and histories of large parts of the world."
"The eye as we know it evolved from a pinhole camera with a lens. It is this lens that is the key to the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt to near and far vision. Other creatures' eyes display different adaptations. Charles Darwin himself acknowledged that the idea of there having evolved seemed absurd."
"The human eye is an amazing mechanism, able to detect anywhere from a few photons to direct sunlight. Doctors and scientists are looking at different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants for the vision impaired. And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision and flexibilty of the human eye may even enable it to surpass its own evolution."
"A dog's sense of smell can pick up things that can't even be seen at all. Olfaction is more primal than other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect directly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct. Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards."
"Dogs' incredible nose reveals a whole other world beyond our eyes. Olfactory system dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative brain area in dogs than in humans. With the proper training, they can even alert us to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer."
"About 1/10 of the world's population are lefthanded. Human evolution has been shaped by cooperation, as well as competition. The persistence of lefties as a small but stable minority reflects an equilibrium that comes from competitive and cooperative effects."
"Despite what many may think, handedness is not a choice. It can be predicted even before birth based on the fetus' position in the womb. Identical twins, who have the same genes, can have different dominant hands. The speed of the waves depends on factors like the altitude and temperature of the air."
"At sea level, sound travels at about 1225 km/h. When an object goes supersonic, moving faster than the sound it makes, the picture changes dramatically. The waves are forced together, forming a Mach cone. This is the cause of the famous Doppler effect, where approaching objects sound higher pitched."
"Aircraft traveling at supersonic speed create a shock wave with a thunderlike noise known as a sonic boom, which can cause distress to people and animals below. Scientists around the world have been looking at sonic booms, trying to predict their path in the atmosphere."
The thyroid is the body's operations manager. Its role is to make sure that the cells in your body are working properly. It does that by using hormones to deliver messages to every single one of them. There are medical treatments that can help trigger the thyroid's activities again.
"The thyroid is controlled by the pituitary gland, a hormonal gland deep in the brain. When you need more energy, the thyroid helps by sending out hormones to increase metabolism. The thyroid allows our cells to use energy, grow and reproduce. It is a small unassuming organ that wields enormous power over your body."
"In the third century BC, Hieron, king of the Sicilian city of Syracuse, chose Archimedes to supervise an engineering project of unprecedented scale. Hundreds of workmen were to labor for years on constructing the Syracusia out of beams of pine and fir from Mount Etna."
Scientists have developed a way to refold proteins using a centrifuge. The technique can be used to make new drugs faster and cheaper. It can also be used for cooking eggs and unboiling them in the shell. But it is not the same as cooking an egg in the conventional way.
"Eggs are mostly made of water and proteins. They are held together by weak chemical bonds. Adding heat disrupts those bonds, allowing the proteins to unfold, uncoil and wiggle freely. This process is called denaturing."
"The space between bones gets bigger, but the amount of synovial fluid stays constant. That creates a lowpressure zone that pulls dissolved gases out of the fluid. Inside the joint, the escaping gases form a bubble with a pop. Some scientists think there may actually be two pops."
"The joints in your fingers are the easiest ones to crack. Many people also crack the joints between vertebrae in their neck and back. The space between the two bones is filled with a viscous liquid, synovial fluid. It contains long, lubricating molecules, like hyaluronic acid and lubricin."
"The Wars of the Roses were fought between the Lancasters and the Yorkists. Henry Tudor was a direct descendant of the first Duke of Lancaster, raised in exile after his father's death in a previous rebellion. His younger brother Richard III declared his nephews illegitimate due to their father's secret marriage."
"The Wars of the Roses were a power struggle between two noble families spanning generations. The name of the ensuing wars comes from the symbols associated with the two families, the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster. The reallife seeds of war were sewn  by the death of King Edward III in 1377."
"The Magnus effect was first documented by Sir Isaac Newton after he noticed it while playing a game of tennis back in 1670. The same physics make it possible to score another  apparently impossible goal, an unassisted corner kick. In 1997,  in a game between France and Brazil, a young Brazilian player named Roberto Carlos set up for a 35 meter free kick."
"A semicolon is a punctuation mark that connects two independent clauses. It looks like a comma crossed with a period, but it's not meant to do that. Unless they're being used in lists, semicolons should only connect clauses that are related."
"The semicolon is stronger than a comma, and less final than a period. It fills the spaces in between, and for that reason, it has some specific and important tasks. In listlike sentences, it can exert more force than commas do."
"ProtoGermanic was spoken about 6000 years ago on the Pontic steppe in modern day Ukraine and Russia. English descended from an even more ancient language called ProtoIndoEuropean. English has t where Latin has d, and f where latin has p"
"Modern English shares many words with Latinderived romance languages, like French and Spanish. Most of those words were not originally part of it. Instead, they started coming  into the language with the Norman invasion of England in 1066. When the Frenchspeaking Normans conquered England and became its ruling class, they brought their speech with them."
"The question, Who am I? is one of the most difficult to answer. Many people have tried to answer it, but none have come up with the right answer. The best answer is to think of yourself as a collection of parts that are constantly changing."
"Three words have sent poets to the blank page, philosophers to the Agora, and seekers to the oracles. Theseus, the mythical founder of Athens, singlehandedly slayed the evil Minotaur at Crete, then returned home on a ship."
"95% of baldness in men can be attributed to male pattern baldness. Baldness is inherited, and in people with this condition, follicles become incredibly sensitive to the effects of dihydrotestosterone. Long periods of stress can release signals that shock follicles and force them into the resting phase prematurely."
"Scientists have discovered that the roots that give rise to our hair actually remain alive. Using this knowledge, scientists have developed drugs that shorten the resting phase, and force follicles into anagen. Other drugs combat male pattern baldness by blocking the conversion  of testosterone to DHT so that it doesn't affect sensitive follicles."
"Add up the numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two. In a given row, treat each number as part of a decimal expansion. The numbers in the next diagonal are called the triangular numbers. If you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal known as Sierpinski's Triangle."
"In the Western world, it's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal. In China, it is known as Yang Hui's Triangle. It is a testament to the elegantly  interwoven fabric of mathematics. And it's still revealing fresh secrets to this day."
"Pascal's Triangle looks like a neatly arranged stack of numbers, but it's actually a mathematical treasure trove. The coefficients,  or numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row of Pascal's Triangle. Age also affects  our memorymaking abilities."
"People who are depressed are 40% more likely to develop memory problems. Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter connected to arousal, may make depressed individuals less attentive to new information. Isolation, which is tied to depression, is another memory thief. Make sure you keep physically active and eat well."
"Exposing your brain to challenges, like learning a new language, is one of the best defenses for keeping your memories intact. Neurons throughout the brain communicate at dedicated sites called synapses using specialized neurotransmitters. As we get older, synapses begin to falter and weaken, affecting how easily we can retrieve memories."
"If you have a fixed mindset, you might give up, assuming you've discovered something you're not very good at. If you think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. Studies show that those who fail regularly and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond to challenges and setbacks."
"confidence is the belief that you are valuable, worthwhile, and capable, also known as selfesteem. The excitement you'll feel knowing that whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge and understanding is confidence. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors that impact confidence."
"Supernovas create heavier elements that a star under normal circumstances can't form. Gold was likely delivered this way before being kneaded into veins by geothermal activity. Billions of years later, we now extract this precious product by mining it."
"To understand how this precious metal became embedded  in our planet to start with, we have to gaze upwards at the stars. Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen, the simplest and lightest element. The enormous gravitational pressure of so much material compresses and triggers nuclear fusion in the star's core."
"Programs that can translate words from one language to another are in the works. They use a lexical database, which includes all the words  you'd find in a dictionary. But they also use rules to recognize the basic linguistic elements in the input."
"The areal density of a modern hard drive is about 600 gigabits per square inch. This is 300 million times greater than that of IBM's first hard drive from 1957. Shrink all that down so that it fits in the palm of your hand, and you'd have something equivalent to your local library."
"At the heart of every hard drive is a stack of highspeed spinning discs. Each disc is coated with a film of microscopic magnetised metal grains. Data is written onto the disc by converting strings of bits into electrical current. Once this information is written, the drive uses a magnetic reader to turn it back into a useful form."
"The amount of nurturing  a mother rat provides its newborn baby plays a part in determining how that baby responds to stress later in life. The pups of nurturing moms turned out less sensitive to stress because their brains developed  more cortisol receptors. Pups of negligent moms had the opposite outcome, and so became moresensitive to stress throughout life."
"Chronic stress can affect brain size, its structure, and how it functions, right down to the level of your genes. Stress begins with something called the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis, a series of interactions between endocrine glands in the brain and on the kidney."
"Betsy is living in a world of happiness that is not based in reality. Is there value in not knowing the truth? No, but there are things in life that do have intrinsic value. No, you don't have to leave reality behind, but it's better than not knowing."
"The experiment was designed to refute a philosophical notion called hedonism. For hedonists, the best choice that a person could make for himself is one that brings him the greatest possible amount of pleasure while bringing him no pain. Limitless pleasure minus zero pain equals maximum net pleasure, the exact scenario the Experience Machine offers."
"Clue seven says the owner of the horse is next door, which can only be the second house. Since the only column missing both these values is the center one, this must be the Brit's redwalled home. Clue ten tells you that the cat owner lives next to the Blendsmoking Dane, putting him in the first house."
"The world's rarest fish has been stolen from the city aquarium. The police are trying to track down the culprits. The puzzle is similar to a Sudoku puzzle, but with a twist. The fish have no bones, so they can move in any direction."
Cephalopods may have evolved complex brains long before our vertebrate relatives. Their radically different nervous system and autonomously thinking appendages have inspired new research in developing flexible robots made of soft materials. studying how intelligence can arise along such a divergent evolutionary path can help us understand more about intelligence and consciousness in general.
"octopuses are mollusks belonging to the order cephalopoda, Greek for headfeet. The central brain only contains about 10% of the neurons, while the two huge optic lobes contain about 30%. The other 60% are in the tentacles, which for humans would be like our arms having minds of their own."
We dream to keep our brains from shutting down. We also dream to help us cope with life's challenges. We dream to prepare ourselves for the future. We sleep to prepare us for the present. We dreamed to prepare for the past. We slept to prepare our present.
"Sigmund Freud theorized that everything  we remember when we wake up from a dream is a symbolic representation of our unconscious primitive thoughts, urges, and desires. Researchers found that subjects were much better at getting through a complex 3D maze if they had napped and dreamed of the maze prior to their second attempt."
"According to the National Institute of Mental Health, it takes the average person suffering with a mental illness over ten years to ask for help. Medications and therapy complement each other to boost brain chemicals. In extreme cases, electroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure in the patient's brain, is also very helpful."
"Depression can have a lot of different symptoms: a low mood, loss of interest in things you'd normally enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, poor concentration, restlessness or slowness. Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world."
"foods high in starch, like crackers and white bread, are digested easily. These foods have a high glycemic index, the amount that a particular food raises the sugar level in your blood. Foods high in fiber, like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, slow the release of glucose into the blood."
"As much as 32% of the population in the U.S. has metabolic syndrome. Carbohydrates can be simple or complex depending on their structure. Glucose, fructose,  and galactose are all simple sugars. Complex carbohydrates with three to ten linked sugars are oligosaccharides."
"Simpson's paradox is where the same set of data can appear to show opposite trends depending on how it's grouped. This often occurs when aggregated data hides a conditional variable, sometimes known as a lurking variable. One study in the UK appeared to show that smokers had a higher survival rate than nonsmokers."
"Data can be grouped and divided in any number of ways, and overall numbers may sometimes give a more accurate picture. All we can do is carefully study the actual situations the statistics describe and consider whether lurking variables may be present. Otherwise, we leave ourselves vulnerable to those who would use data to manipulate others and promote their own agendas."
"Since you know you aren't possessed, you can explore one of the halls alone. Don't worry about the possessed students attacking or otherwise harming the others. The possessed students might lie, or they might not, but you know there are only two of them."
"Napolon introduced a new constitution and a legal code that kept some of the most important achievements of the revolution in tact. He deprived women of the rights that the revolution had given them and even reinstated slavery in the French colonies. The giant sandglass in the center is now flowing, with less than an hour before it empties."
"Napolon Bonaparte was a ruler full of contradictions. He defended a popular revolution by imposing absolute dictatorship, and spreading liberal ideals through imperial wars. He never achieved his dream of conquering Europe, but undoubtedly left his mark on it, for better or for worse."
"Bertrand Russell said we love in order to quench our physical and psychological desires. Love's delight, intimacy, and warmth helps us overcome our fear of the world, escape our lonely shells, and engage more abundantly in life. Buddha discovered the eightfold path, a program for extinguishing the fires of desire."
"Love is the desire to integrate with another and infuses our lives with meaning. Simone de Beauvoir advised loving authentically, which is more like a great friendship. Lovers support each other in discovering themselves, reaching beyond themselves and enriching their lives and the world together."
"Love makes us suffer and makes us soar. Maybe we find ourselves. If love has a purpose, neither science nor psychology has discovered it yet. It's not like the Star Trek universe, where some characters can fully share thoughts and feelings."
"Communication is a twoway street. One person expresses her interpretation of a message, and the person she's communicating with hears his own interpretation of that message. Every person interprets the message they receive based on their relationship  with the other person, and their unique understanding of the semantics."
"Miscommunication can lead to confusion, animosity, misunderstanding, or even crashing a multimillion dollar probe into the surface of Mars. Even when facetoface with another person, in the very same room, human communication is incredibly complex. A basic understanding of what happens when we communicate can help us prevent miscommunication."
"Nuclear radiation comes from natural sources, like radon, a gas which seeps up from the ground. The biggest health risk occurs when lots of ionizing radiation hits us in a short time period. Acute exposures overwhelm the body's natural ability to repair the damage."
"The average person receives 6.2 millisieverts of radiation from all sources annually, around a third due to radon. Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical and magnetic waves oscillating through space. As these waves oscillate faster, they scale up in energy and can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death."
"Modern society is shaped by sending and detecting electromagnetic radiation. Nuclear radiation originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other due to their mutually positive charges. Some combinations of protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain unstable."
"Do I assume the sender is telling the truth? Based on the evidence, is it logical to assume I'll win any money? Consider the implications of a political candidate's policies. Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of the opposing political candidate."
"Critical thinking is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully deconstruct a situation. It can reveal its hidden issues, such as bias and manipulation, and make the best decision. Here's one fivestep process that may help you solve any number of problems."
"A rich, eccentric uncle left all of his money to his 99 relatives. In his will, he left a puzzle to be solved. If all 100 of you answer it together, you will share the money evenly. If you are the first to find the pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work, you get the entire inheritance."
"Heir 3 will change the status of every third locker, specifically if it's open,  she'll close it. If it's closed, she'll open it. This pattern will continue until all 100 of you have gone. The words in the lockers that remain open at the end will help you crack the code."
"The recommended daily intake varies from between 2.53.7 liters of water for men, and about 22.7liters for women. Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to the cells inside our own bodies."
"Each day we lose two to three liters through our sweat, urine, and bowel movements. Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%. Even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water. Maintaining a balanced water level is essential to avoid dehydration or overhydration."
"The placebo effect is an unexplained phenomenon where drugs, treatments, and therapies that aren't supposed to have an effect, miraculously make people feel better. Placebos seem to be capable of causing measurable change in blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of painreducing chemicals."
"The word placebo means I shall please in Latin, hinting at a history of placating troubled patients. Placebos had to mimic the real treatments in order to be convincing, so they took the form of sugar pills, waterfilled injections and even sham surgeries."
"Grammar is a set of patterns for how words are put together to form phrases or clauses. Different languages have different patterns. The study of these patterns opens up an ongoing debate between two positions known as prescriptivism and descriptivism. In English, the subject normally comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object."
"From 19932008, the same female DNA was found in multiple crime scenes around Europe, incriminating an elusive killer dubbed the Phantom of Heilbronn. But the DNA evidence was so consistent precisely because it was wrong. It turned out that the cotton swabs used to collect the DNA samples had all been accidentally contaminated by a woman working in the swab factory."
"When the immune system is under serious attack, it secretes more cytokines, which trigger two responses. cytokines travel through the body to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for controlling temperature, thirst, hunger, and sleep, among other things. The hypothalamus sends signals that instruct your muscles to contract and causes a rise in body temperature. Some theorize that they aid in recovery."
"Sleep lets your body channel more energy towards fighting infection. When you stop eating, your liver can take up much of the iron in your blood. The rise in temperature can slow bacteria and help your immune system destroy pathogens. sickness can also make you irritable, sad, and confused."
"Virus infection alerts your body's immune system to your plight. As soon as it becomes aware of infection, your body leaps to your defense. Cells called macrophages charge in as the first line of attack, searching for and destroying the viruses and infected cells."
"Computer memory is made up of billions of bits. Data on most current storage media has less than a tenyear life expectancy. Scientists are working to exploit the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making memory devices faster, smaller, and more durable."
"Heuristics are notoriously bad for applying heuristics. Heuristics can lead to irrational decisions, not like falling in love or bungee jumping off a cliff, but logical fallacies that can easily be proven wrong. In many ways, our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future."
"The anchoring effect is often used in marketing and negotiations to raise the prices that people are willing to pay. For most of human history, survival depended on making quick decisions with limited information. Today's environment requires far more complex decisionmaking, and these decisions are more biased by unconscious factors."
"Loss aversion is one cognitive bias that arises from heuristics, problemsolving approaches based on previous experience and intuition rather than careful analysis. The negative psychological impact we feel from losing something is about twice as strong as the positive impact of gaining the same thing."
"Americans today are the most politically polarized since the Civil War, making it nearly impossible to reach a broad consensus. Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive a twothirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress."
"The U.S. hasn't passed an amendment to the Constitution since 1992. The Bill of Rights includes some of America's most wellknown freedoms. Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee that such a minimum number exists for certain patterns, but no easy way to find it."
"The chances of a text concealing a prophecy are pretty high, according to mathematician T.S. Motzkin. Ramsey theory states that given enough elements in a set or structure, some particular pattern among them is guaranteed to emerge. It's the reason we can find geometric shapes in the night sky, and it explains why patterns can be found in just about any text."
"It takes about two years of training for already fluent bilingual professionals to expand their vocabulary. To get used to the unnatural task of speaking while they listen, students shadow speakers and repeat their every word. In time, they begin to paraphrase  what is said, making stylistic adjustments as they go."
"In 1956, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev told Western Bloc ambassadors, My vas pokhoronim! This statement sent shockwaves through the Western world, heightening the tension between the Soviet Union and the US who were in the thick of the Cold War. Some believe this incident alone set East/West relations back a decade. So now, given the complexities of language and cultural exchange, how does this sort of thing not happen all the time?"
"As the years pass, our bodies accumulate genetic damage in the form of DNA lesions. Organelles called mitochondria are especially prone to this damage. Genes silenced or expressed only at low levels in newborns become prominent in older people, leading to the development of degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's."
"Jeanne Calment, 122, is the oldest known person in history. Cellrepairing nanobots, or gene therapy, could artificially extend our years. Human bodies just aren't built for extreme aging. Our capacity is set at about 90 years."
"There's a lot of confusion regarding the difference between the terms migrant and refugee Migrants usually refers to people  who leave their country for reasons not related to persecution. Most refugee journeys  are long and perilous with limited access to shelter, water, or food."
"The term 'refugee' was first used in the UN's 1951 Refugee Convention. It means someone who is unable to return to their home country because of wellfounded fears of being persecuted. The most basic obligation towards refugees is nonrefoulement, a principle preventing a nation from sending an individual to a country where their life is threatened."
"Around the globe, there are approximately 60 million people who have been forced to leave their homes to escape war, violence, and persecution. A diet with a range of foods helps  maintain a balanced combination of brain messengers, and keeps your mood from getting skewed in one direction or the other."
"Your choices have a direct and longlasting effect on the most powerful organ in your body. Oats, grains, and legumes have slower glucose release, enabling a steadier level of attentiveness. Eating omegarich foods, like nuts, seeds, and fatty fish is crucial to the creation and maintenance of cell membranes."
"Diethyl ether was the first common inhalational anesthetics. Inhalational anesthesia is usually supplemented with intravenous anesthesia. Common intravenous agents include sedatives, like propofol, which induce unconsciousness, and opioids, like fentanyl, which reduce pain."
"Anesthesia is a form of pain control. It works by sending electrical signals through the nervous system. It can be used to control the heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs. It is also used to treat serious injuries, such as broken bones."
"School sport participation has also been shown to reduce the risk of suffering from depression for up to four years. The experience of coming to terms with defeat can build the resilience and selfawareness necessary to manage academic, social, and physical hurdles."
"Exercising has all sorts of health benefits, like strengthening our bones and clearing out bad cholesterol from our arteries. Our brains also release a number of chemicals when we workout, including endorphins. These natural hormones, which control pain and pleasure responses in the cental nervous system, can lead to feelings of euphoria, or a runner's high."
"You and a group of friends are trapped in an ancient Roman palace. They have been given a series of clues to find their way out. One of the clues is to work out the sum of the first two numbers. The third and final number is 2,2,9."
"In this dystopian world, your resistance group is humanity's last hope. Before you're thrown into the dungeon, you see many numbered hallways leading outside. But each exit is blocked by an electric barrier with a combination keypad. You learn that one of you will be allowed to try to escape by passing a challenge."
"When Napolon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses to use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms. The metric system remained standard for formal use, and it spread across the continent, along with France's borders. After Portugal and the Netherlands switched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system."
The metric system arose from a political revolution. The leaders of the French Revolution sought to completely transform society. The Academy of Sciences convened to reform the system of measurements. Old standards based on arbitrary authority or local traditions were replaced with mathematical and natural relationships.
"Some languages often leave out the second person pronoun. In languages like Romanian and Portuguese, the pronoun can be dropped from sentences because it's clearly implied by the way the verbs are conjugated. Speakers often would rather have the listener guess the pronoun from context than use the wrong one."
"In many languages, the pronoun reflects these differences through what's known as the TV distinction. In languages like Hausa or Korana, the you form depends on the listener's gender. In many more, it depends on whether they are one or many, such as with German Du or ihr"
"The choice of contraceptive method is a personal one, and what works best for you now may change later. Hormonal methods in particular can cause symptoms like headaches, nausea, and high blood pressure, but they vary from woman to woman. Scientists continue to research new methods, such as a male pill that would prevent sperm production."
"Spermicide is a chemical that immobilizes and destroys sperm. Spermicides come as foam, cream, jelly, suppositories, and even a thin piece of translucent film. The third category for preventing pregnancy works by suppressing the action of an egg maturing in the ovary."
"Aristotle described three types of persuasive speech. Forensic, or judicial, rhetoric establishes facts and judgements about the past. Epideictic, or demonstrative, rhetoric makes a proclamation about the present. Pathos appeals to emotion, and in our age of mass media, it's often the most effective mode."
"Rhetoric is the rhetoric of politicians debating a new law by imagining what effect it might have. It's also the rhetoric  of activists urging change, such as Martin Luther King Jr's dream that his children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin."
"There are 24 possible ways to solve this riddle. The odds of success are about 30%. There are eight distinct threebox loops. There are ten different ways to answer the riddle, depending on the number of musicians. The answer is found in the next section."
"Each musician only has a 50% chance of finding their instrument by picking five random boxes. The chances that all ten will succeed are even lower  just 1 in 1024. Each contains one of your instruments, but don't be fooled by the pictures  they've been randomly placed."
"Humans should urinate at least four to six times a day, but occasionally, the pressures of modern life forces us to clench and hold it in. But holding it in for too long, forcing out your urine too fast, or urinating without proper physical support may over time weaken or overwork that muscular sling."
"The bladder is an oval pouch that sits inside the pelvis. It is made up of two kidneys, two ureters and two urethral sphincters. The bladder's muscular wall relaxes as the bladder fills allowing it to inflate like a balloon."
"Humans used to eat less sugar than we do now, but they still had cavities. They used to use flint and beeswax to fill in the holes in their teeth. Today, we use toothpastes and other methods to fill the holes."
"The best way to avoid a cavity is still cutting down on sugar intake and practicing good oral hygiene. That includes regular tooth brushing, flossing, and avoiding sugary, starchy, and sticky foods that cling to your teeth between meals."
"How to sort books using Bubble Sort. First, pick a random book and compare it to every other book. Then, divide the line by placing all the books that come before the partition on its left and all the ones that come after it on its right. This is called Insertion Sort. Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't require comparing every pair of books."
"QuickSort is one of the most efficient strategies used by programmers today. Each round of partitioning requires about 1,280 comparisons. If your partitions are pretty balanced, dividing the books into 128 sublines of ten would take about seven rounds, or 8,960 seconds."
"Computerized emotion recognition can be used to identify objects and people. The more training data it's given, the better the algorithm becomes at correctly identifying new images. To train the network, sample inputs preclassified into different categories, such as photos marked happy or sad, are fed into the system."
"Social media companies are considering using algorithms to help prevent crime by flagging posts that contain specific words or phrases. And emotion recognition software can help treat mental disorders or even provide people with lowcost automated psychotherapy. But the prospect of a massive network automatically scanning our photos, communications, and physiological signs is also quite worrying."
"The Mental Synthesis Theory says that, again, timing is key. If the neuronal ensembles for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time, we can perceive the two separate objects as a single image. But this principle doesn't explain the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations without ever seeing them."
"Neurons are wrapped in a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin is an insulator and speeds up the electrical signals  zipping down the nerve fiber. Some neural fibers have as many as 100 layers of myelin, while others only have a few."
"In Western astrology, it's a constellation determined by when your birthday falls in the calendar. But according to the Chinese zodiac,  it's the animal assigned to your birth year. Each year is associated with one of the animals in this order, with the cycle starting over every 60 years."
"The Great Race in China determined which animals were enshrined in the Chinese zodiac. As the system spread through Asia, other cultures made changes to reflect their communities. You can also have an inner animal based on your birth month, and a secret animal based upon your birth hour."
"Heart attack symptoms may be less prominent in women and the elderly. In many people, especially those with diabetes, a heart attack may be silent. Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin can help keep the heart attack from getting worse."
"Exercise, a healthy diet, and weight loss all lower the risk of heart attacks. Doctors recommend exercising a few times a week, doing both aerobic activity and strength training. A hearthealthy diet is low in sugar and saturated fats, which are linked to heart disease."
"cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other problems like strokes, is the world's leading killer. Approximately 7 million people around the world die from heart attacks every year. The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygendeprived heart muscle."
"Practice is the repetition of an action with the goal of improvement. Laptops, smartphones, and particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions. Many top athletes, musicians, and dancers spend 5060 hours per week on activities related to their craft."
"Our brains are made up of grey matter and white matter. The grey matter carries information from the brain to the spinal cord. The white matter is wrapped in myelin, which protects the nerve cells. The more myelin there is, the more energy is sent to the brain's axons."
"Pasipha asked Daedalus to help her seduce a halfhuman halfbull minotaur. He constructed a hollow wooden cow so realistic that it fooled the bull. Pasiphaa hid inside the cow and gave birth to the half human half bull. The king, Minos, then imprisoned the inventor and his son Icarus in a tower. But Daeus and Icarus were able to escape by building giant wings."
"In mythological ancient Greece, the line that separated god from man was absolute and the punishment for mortals who attempted to cross it was severe. In the end, both men paid for their departure from the path of moderation dearly, Icarus with his life and Daedalus with his regret."
"Chocolate was invented in 1828 by Dutchman Coenraad van Houten. It was first used as a medicine for ailments, like upset stomachs. By the 20th century, chocolate was no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public."
"The Aztecs drank chocolate at royal feasts, gave it to soldiers as a reward for success in battle, and used it in rituals. The first transatlantic chocolate encounter occurred in 1519 when Hernn Corts visited the court of Moctezuma at Tenochtitlan."
The tardigrade is one of the toughest creatures on Earth. It can survive in the hottest and coldest places on the planet. Scientists are now trying to find out how they survive without water. They hope to use this information to develop new vaccines and crops.
"In a recent study, scientists exchanged the regular highfiber diets of a group of rural South Africans with the highfat, meatheavy diets of AfricanAmericans. The rural African group showed increased inflammation of the colon, as well as a decrease of butyrate."
"Fermented foods are teeming with helpful probiotic bacteria, like lactobacillus and bifidobacteria. Foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, and kombucha provide variety and vitality to our diets."
"Diet is emerging as one of the leading influences on the health of our guts. Dietary fiber from foods like fruits,  vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains is the best fuel for gut bacteria. When bacteria digest fiber, they produce short chain fatty acids that nourish the gut barrier, improve immune function, and can help prevent inflammation."
"The average lifespan of a human is 71 years. This is higher than the average life expectancy of a bird. The reason is that birds live longer, while humans live shorter. The difference is due to differences in cell size and cell death rate."
"The leading theory is that our skin has evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're equipped to deal with risks from the outside world. Greenland sharks can live to over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog can live up to 500."
"The average person experiences dozens of individual itches each day. They can be triggered by all sorts of things, including allergic reactions, dryness, and even some diseases. Researchers are also searching for the genes involved in itching and developing treatments to try and block the pathway of an itch."
"In Australia, you can find a second type of mammal  marsupials. Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate when they're born that they must continue developing in the mother's pouch. The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single jelly beansized baby at a time."
"Mammals are vertebrates, meaning they have backbones. Placenta is what keeps the calf alive during pregnancy. Monotreme species lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Echidnas and the duckbilled platypus are the only two monotremes."
"The three pirates must decide how to divide up the gold. Amaro should bribe the other pirates with most of the gold to increase his chances. Charlotte should offer Eliza slightly more than nothing, one coin at a time. Daniel should propose to keep all the gold and Eliza's one vote would not be enough."
"Each player gets one coin to give to the other. If there's a tie, the other player gets the other coin. The winner gets to give the other one to the next person in the line of succession. If the other person wins, the winner gets the remaining coin."
"Ibuprofen blocks the production of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals. The body starts efficiently eliminating the drug, with the blood dose decreasing by half every two hours on average. Back in the liver, another small fraction of the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out by the kidneys."
"Children are the most difficult to dose because their bodies change so quickly. If the dose is too low, the drug won't do its job. The best way to get the right dose is to read the label and consult your doctor or pharmacist."
"The effects of ibuprofen on the body can last for up to a week. The drug can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, and other parts of the body. It can also cause liver damage if the drug is not taken in the right way."
"The tea trade was so lucrative that the world's fastest sailboat, the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition. Archaeological evidence suggests tea was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built the Great Pyramids of Giza."
"The first tea was eaten as a vegetable or cooked with grain porridge. After hundreds of years of variations to the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, and create a beverage called muo cha, or matcha."
"Before World War II, manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware used uranium oxide in colored glazes. It wasn't until the mid20th century we realized that radium's harmful effects as a radioactive element outweighed its visual benefits. Orange dishes made during the next decade may still have some hazardous qualities on their surfaces."
"Lead was used to make white paint in the 4th century BCE. The pigment was then used to create the color orange. In 1898, it was discovered to be a carcinogen. It is thought to have been used in the painting of the American Civil War."
The Voynich manuscript is thought to have been written in the 14th century. It is written in an unknown language. Some believe it was written by a Renaissance scholar. Others believe it is written by an ancient tribe. It has been carbon dated to around 1420.
The Voynich manuscript is the only copy of a 240page book. It was written by a Polish Jesuit priest in the early 1800s. The book is written in a language that has never been seen before. It is thought to be written in the language of the 15thcentury.
Inventors have proposed plenty of ideas to keep a perpetual motion machine moving. Several of these have been variations on Bhaskara's overbalanced wheel with rolling balls or weights on swinging arms. None of them work because the parts that make one side of the wheel heavier also shift its center of mass downward below the axle.
"The laws of thermodynamics have stymied every idea for a perpetual motion machine. Even if engineers could somehow design a machine that didn't violate the first law, it still wouldn't work in the real world. The one thing that seems truly perpetual is our search for new exotic forms of matter."
"The first law of thermodynamics says that energy can't be created or destroyed. Around 1159 A.D., a mathematician called Bhaskara the Learned sketched a design for a wheel containing curved reservoirs of mercury. The idea was radical and helped to disprove the longstanding model of atoms."
Marie Curie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics. She was also the first person to discover the neutron star. She died in 1934 after suffering a heart attack in a car crash. Her work helped pave the way for the development of modern medicine.
"Most cults share some basic characteristics. A typical cult requires a high level of commitment from its members. It maintains a strict hierarchy, separating unsuspecting supporters and recruits from the inner workings. It claims to provide answers to life's biggest questions through its doctrine, along with the required recipe for change."
"Cults are skilled at knowing whom to target. They tend to be motivated by money, sex, or all three. The resulting internal conflict, known as cognitive dissonance, keeps you trapped. Many members eventually find a way out, whether through their own realizations or the help of family and friends."
"A cult is a group or movement with a shared commitment to an extreme ideology. Not all cults are religious. Some are political, therapybased, focused on selfimprovement, or otherwise. The Peoples Temple was founded by Reverend Jim Jones in 1955. 909 people died after being forced to drink poisoned Flavor Aid."
"Engineers have been trying to find a way to land a rover on Mars without burning fuel. They have come up with a number of ideas, but they need to be tested before they can be used. The next step is to develop a system that will allow the rover to land on the surface."
"Many scientific advances have occurred when serendipitous failures in one field address the constraints of another. Creative constraints apply  across professions, to architects and artists, writers, engineers, and scientists. In many fields, constraints play a special role as drivers of discovery and invention."
"The idea that the left side of the brain controls logic and the right, creativity, is a myth unsupported by scientific evidence. Some people may be particularly logical or creative, but that has nothing to do with the sides of their brains. The idea of logic and creativity being at odds with each other doesn't hold up well."
"The human brain is split into a left and right side. The left and the right sides of the brain do control different body functions. The brain uses both sides to make a complete image of the world. Every brain is different, which explains why people's experiences of concussions vary."
"Subconcussive impacts can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms unfold slowly over time. This category of injury doesn't cause noticable symptoms right away, but can lead to severe degenerative brain diseases over time if it happens repeatedly. Trying to play through a concussion, even for only a few minutes, makes it more likely to develop PCS."
"The brain is made of 90 billion neurons, which relay signals through their long axons to communicate throughout the brain and control our bodies. A sudden jolt can make the brain shift and bump against the skull's hard interior, and unlike jello, the brain's tissue isn't uniform. The culprit is a protein called tau."
Deep water fish don't reproduce until they're at least ten years old. This makes them vulnerable to overfishing when the young are caught before they've had the chance to spawn. Consumer taste and prices can also have harmful effects. Almost 31% of the world's fish populations are overfished.
"Modern industrial fishing looks more like warfare. Radar, sonar, helicopters, and spotter planes are all used to guide factory ships towards dwindling schools of fish. Long lines with hundreds of hooks or huge nets round up massive amounts of fish, including seabirds, turtles, and dolphins."
Fishermen are using new technology to catch more fish. But they are also using it to make more mistakes. People who are not as good at something as they think they are are most likely to make mistakes. The problem is that we don't know how to fix it.
The DunningKruger effect isn't a question of ego blinding us to our weaknesses. People usually do admit their deficits once they can spot them. Experts tend to be aware of just how competent they are. But they often make a different mistake: they assume that everyone else is too.
"Psychological research suggests that we're not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately. The more knowledgeable we become, the less likely we are to have invisible holes in our competence. The DunningKruger effect explains why more than 100 studies have shown that people display illusory superiority."
"You wouldnt even know it was there, if not for the red lump that appears, accompanied by a telltale itch. A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria and viruses to reproduce and spread because theyre temperaturesensitive. When body cells are damaged, they release chemicals that make fluid leak into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling."
"The immune system is a vast network of cells, tissues, and organs that coordinate your bodys defenses against any threats to your health. Without it, youd be exposed to billions of bacteria, viruses, and toxins that could make something as minor as a paper cut or seasonal cold fatal."
"Choking is when a person fails to perform a task despite years of practice. Research suggests that some are more susceptible than others, especially those who are selfconscious, anxious, and afraid of being judged by others. It helps to practice under stressful conditions."
"Choking is common in sports, where performance often occurs under intense pressure. Performance suffers when the mind is preoccupied with worries, doubts, or fears. Tasks that challenge working memory, the mental scratch pad we use to temporarily store phone numbers are especially vulnerable to pressure."
"By 2019 its predicted that  therell be close to 3 billion in use. Phone waste can also end up in huge dump sites, leaching toxic chemicals. Ewaste is sometimes intentionally exported to countries where labor is cheap."
"Rare earths are a selection of 17 elements that are common in Earths crust and are found in many areas across the world in low concentrations. These elements have a huge range of magnetic, phosphorescent, and conductive properties that make them crucial to modern technologies. In smartphones, these create the screen and color display, aid conductivity, and produce the signature vibrations."
"Cervantes novel unfolds as a collection of episodes detailing the mishaps of the valiant knight. The book was so well received that readers clamored for more. After a rival author attempted to cash in on a fake followup, Cervantes released the official sequel in response."
"Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote is the bestselling novel of all time. The tale follows the adventures of Alonso Quijano, known as the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance. The novel has inspired art, literature, popular culture, and even political revolution."
The cortical homunculus is a model of the human body with proportions based on the size of each body parts representation in the cortex. The amount of cortex devoted  to a specific body part can grow or shrink based on how much sensory input the brain receives from that body part.
The accuracy of these apparitions suggests that we have a map of the body in our brains. The loss of a limb alters the way signals travel at every step of the pathway. We dont know why some amputees escape the pain typically associated with these phantoms.
"Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot is considered a play that changed the face of modern drama. Written between 1949 and 1955, it offers a simple but stirring question  what should the characters do? Critics have offered countless readings of the play, resulting in a cycle of ambiguity and speculation."
"Theatre of the Absurd is a movement which emerged after the Second World War. The characters wait in vain for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose. While they wait, they sink into boredom, express religious dread and contemplate suicide."
"Gravity causes flames to expand and rise, which gives them their characteristic taper. Molecules emit light when heated, and the color of the light depends on the temperature of the molecules. Even the hottest fires run out of fuel or oxygen eventually."
"Fire is not a plasma, the fourth state of matter in which atoms are stripped of their electrons. Instead, its our sensory experience of a chemical reaction called combustion. In physics, this is described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that systems will gain disorder, or entropy, over time."
"Time is a property that comes out of how the pieces are strung together. Emergent properties are things that dont exist in individual pieces of a system, but do exist for the system as a whole. Could time just be some sort of illusion generated by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe?"
"Einsteins theory seemed to confirm that time is woven into the very fabric of the universe. But why is it we can move through space in any direction, but through time in only one? Physicists are still exploring these and other questions, so were far from a complete explanation."
"Ride designers are well aware of what your body, and the coaster, can handle. At 5 Gs, your body feels 5 times heavier; so if you weigh 100lbs, youd exert the weight of 500 lbs on the coaster. Modern rides are also much sturdier, closely considering the amount of gravity they need to withstand."
"Ride coasters are propelled around their tracks almost entirely by gravitational energy. In the days of the FlipFlap, designers were most concerned with coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track. Today, coasters can pull off far more exciting tricks, without resorting to the thrill of a ride."
"Gravity is generated by variations  in the curvature of spacetime. Traveling higher would make a bigger dent  in gravitys influence, but you wont escape it. Even safely tethered to the Earth, were subject to the faint tug of distant celestial bodies."
"Gravity is the attractive force between two objects with mass. Every object in the universe attracts every other object. Every star, black hole, human being, smartphone, and atom are all constantly pulling on each other. So why dont we feel pulled in billions  of different directions?"
"History versus Henry VIII is on Channel 4 tonight at 9pm. The show will be on the BBC, Channel 4 and Channel 5 at 10pm. For more information on the show, visit the BBC website. For the rest of the program, visit Channel 4s website here."
"Henry VIII embodied all the contradictions of monarchy on the verge of the modern era. His campaigns in France and his brutal invasion of Scotland drained the treasury, and his attempt to pay for it by debasing the coinage led to constant inflation. But separating the ruler from the myth is all part of putting history on trial."
"Henry VIII was a powerful king whose break with the church of Rome would forever change  the course of English history. He uprooted the countrys religious foundations and broke the Church of England away from Rome, leading to centuries of strife. The king asked Thanatos to show him how the chains worked  and quickly bound him instead."
The story of Sisyphus is one of repeated punishment. He was told to roll a boulder up a hill and then roll it down again. He refused to do it twice and was sent back to the top. The story has become a symbol of the futile search for meaning in life.
"In 1968 physicists found that protons and neutrons are actually made of quarks, which are indivisible. A proton contains two up quarks  and one down quark. A neutron contains two down  quarks and one up. Why are there three (and only three) different versions of each of these particles?"
"The ATLAS Experiment on  the Large Hadron Collider is studying the Standard Model indepth. By taking precise measurements of the particles and forces that make up the universe, ATLAS physicists can look for answers to mysteries not explained by the Standard model."
"The Standard Model explains how particles interact with each other. It also covers the forces that govern how particles move, interact, and bind together to give shape to the world around us. While the Standard Model provides a beautiful explanation, there are still a universes worth of mysteries left to explore."
"More than 2,000 cases of meningitis broke out across Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world. Swelling in the brain disrupts its normal function, causing symptoms like hearing loss and extreme light sensitivity. A visit to the hospital can drastically reduce an adults risk of dying from it."
"Meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges, tissue layers responsible for protecting the brain and spinal cord. The disease primarily comes in three forms: fungal, viral, and bacterial. In 1987, tens of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage."
"The Intentional Fallacy states that an artist's intended meaning is the only possible interpretation. Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels argued that an intentional creator is what makes the poem subject to understanding at all. Other thinkers advocate for a middle ground, suggesting that intention is just one piece in a larger puzzle."
"Shakespeare's A Midsummers Night's Dream sees the Bard get psychedelic. The trickster Puck sprinkles the juice of a magical flower over the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander. The result is a night of chaos that includes broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations."
"A Midsummer Night's Dream is one of Shakespeare's  friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. The moon overlooks the action like a silver bow, signifying erratic behavior. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeares plays  it reflects his contemporary concerns."
Killer whales are the main source of food for their families. Older females are more closely related to the family than younger females. This may be why they are more likely to die out in their thirties. They are also more able to raise their own children than other females.
"Until recently we knew very little about killer whales. The details of their lives eluded scientists until an organization called the Center for Whale Research began studying a single population near Washington State and British Columbia in 1976. The more we learn, the more this populations elders  vital role comes into focus."
"As early as 8000 BCE, the earliest Neolithic farmers began a legacy of cheesemaking. Nomadic Mongolians used yaks milk to create hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag. The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined feta cheese, alongside a harder variety similar to  pecorino romano."
"The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic people an enormous survival advantage. Milk was rich with essential proteins,  fats, and minerals. But it also contained high quantities of lactose  a sugar which is difficult to process. Cheese, however, could provide all of milks advantages with much less lactose. And since it could be preserved and stockpiled, these essential nutrients could be eaten throughout scarce famines and long winters."
"One of the more fascinating examples of animal deception comes from the forktailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators. He hopes a nearby female will respond with her own lightshow and mate with him. This tactic works about half the time and it provides drongos with much of their food."
"Behavioral biologists have identified three defining hallmarks of deception by nonhuman animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it cant simply be an accident. Camouflage is a good starting point and one of the most familiar examples  of animal trickery."
"Modern ECT is much safer than it used to be, but patients can still experience side effects. Most patients treated with ECT have two or three sessions per week for several weeks. ECT maintenance works better when paired with medication, even in patients who were resistant to medication before."
"The treatment was first used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a strong electrical current to the brain, causing a wholebody seizure during which patients might bite their tongues or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under  general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series of mild electrical pulses to thebrain. This causes huge numbers of neurons to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure."
"The dwarves presented their treasures to the gods. Loki reappeared in his normal form, overjoyed by their failure. The dwarves presented the treasures made by him and his brother. For Freyr theyd forged a goldenbristled boar. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would make eight more identical rings."
Loki's hammer was too short to hold his head. He had to cut it off to keep it in the right place. But now it was too late and he had to let it go. Now he has to find a way to get it back.
"Loki the mischiefmaker, was writhing uncomfortably in Thors iron grip. He first visited the masterful sons of Ivaldi. He told them that their rivals, a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best craftsmen in the world."
"TED asked you to choose between a circle or a square. Your choice of circle meant flip the coin, and your choice of square was don't flip We received 372 responses. That means we can play 372 games against the quantum computer using your choices."
"The key idea here is that we have to give up on precise values of zero and one and allow for some uncertainty. During the game, the quantum computer creates this fluid combination of heads and tails,zero and one. No matter what the player does, flip or no flip, the superposition remains intact."
"Quantum uncertainty could be used to create private keys for encrypting messages sent from one location to another. It could also transform health care and medicine. Future largescale quantum simulations for drug development could perhaps lead to treatments for Alzheimer's, which affects thousands of lives."
"We must tread carefully and responsibly as we build our quantum future I see quantum computers as a way for us to probe the mysteries of nature The future is fundamentally uncertain, and to me, that is certainly exciting It's a lot of fun for me, being a quantum physicist. I highly recommend it"
"CRISPR is a geneediting tool that can alter DNA and change specific genes almost as easily as fixing a typo. In 2012, scientists figured out how to hijack CRISPR to target not just viral DNA, but any DNA in almost any organism."
"The ability to fix DNA errors means that CRISPR could potentially create new treatments for diseases linked to specific genetic errors. It could create plants that yield larger fruit, mosquitoes that cant transmit malaria, or even reprogram drugresistant cancer cells. Its also a powerful tool  for studying the genome."
"Cats were important to the ancient Egyptians, who used them to catch and kill snakes. The cats then migrated to Europe and the Americas, where they were used as food. Today, cats are used to make DNA sequences, which can be used to create new genes."
"Modern cats are genetically very similar to ancient cats. We've done little to alter their natural behaviors. The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era."
"Boraqchin and her husband lead a procession of two hundred wagons and two hundred wives. Behind them winds the entire civilian city, including holy men, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. She orders the guards to keep close watch on her husband's special reception yurt and portable throne."
"Boraqchin is the formidable khatun of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire. Shes been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson  of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen. While her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks,  family and empire at home."
"According to legend, she was the first mortal woman, whose curiosity set a chain of earthshattering events in motion. Over time, Pandora became more and more  obsessed with the box. Shed take one glance inside, then be able to rid her mind of it forever... But at the first crack of the lid, the box burst open."
"Pandora was breathed into being by Hephaestus, God of fire. From Aphrodite she received the capacity for deep emotion. From Hermes she gained  mastery over language. Finally, Zeus bestowed  two gifts on Pandora. The first was the trait of curiosity, which settled in her spirit."
The sound of an electric car can only be heard at a speed of up to 30 kilometers per hour. The noise of the car is considered as sufficient. The streets of the 21st century are a great case study teeming with transience and disarray.
"I have to define, first of all, a new sound world, something that doesn't belong to our previous experience, he says. Just like a painter with colors, we are able to connect feelings and frequencies, he adds. Sound has the power to create an unexpected sense of wonder, which hypnotizes"
The sound of a car can be defined as a series of different tones and frequencies. The sound of the car can also be thought of as a set of notes or chords. The idea is to create a sound that can be heard by all parts of the body.
"Cars are a metaphor of time, distance and journey, of setting out and returning, of anticipation and adventure, but, at the same time, of intelligence and complexity, of human intuition and accomplishment. The sounds that we envision through sound genetics allow us not only to celebrate this complexity but also to make the world a more elegant and safe space."
"In Fahrenheit 451, the author imagines a world in which all knowledge of the world is lost. He also imagines how the world would look like if all knowledge was lost. The book is about the power of the imagination to change the course of history."
"Fahrenheit 451 opens in a blissful blaze  and before long, we learn whats going up in flames. As his pleasure gives way to doubt, the story raises critical questions of how to preserve one's mind in a society where free will and curiosity are under fire."
"There is a scientifically supported plan of action that could save hundreds of thousands of lives in the area surrounding a nuclear explosion. After the blast there would be at  least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Once inside, plan on staying there for at least 24 hours."
"The full scope of a nuclear detonation is almost unimaginable. Getting and staying inside a sturdy building would offer protection from the explosions shockwave,  heat, and radiation. The thing that erodes trust in an organization faster than anything else is when employees feel that they're being treated unfairly."
"Employees want to be treated the same, regardless of their rank or tenure. Salesforce found that men and women working in the same job with the same level of proficiency were making different amounts of money. Repeating what the person says  that's not listening."
"The way you behave defines the work experience for everyone around you. Organizations that have a lot of happy employees have three times the revenue growth. It's not about pingpong tables and massages and pet walking. Leaders often say, We trust our employees. We empower our employees"
"Architects in the UK have created an 18meterlong structure that recycled all the amorphous material of the quarry, just supported by gravity  no mortar and no ties. Architecture is a profession with many rules, some written, some not, some relevant and others not, but we wanted them."
"We are trying to find a way to make the most of this space, says the architect. It's not just a building, it's a way of life, he adds. We're trying to create a new way of looking at the world"
We're not professional builders but we want to make sure it's possible We are learning that prefabrication can be much more than stacking boxes or that heavy parts can be airy and transparent The lessons that we learn here get translated into other projects and other programs and other scales as well
The General Society of Authors and Editors built a cultural building in the middle of a mountain range. The building is made up of a constellation of spaces spread across the vast territory of the mountains. The architects used the land both as support and as material to build the building.
"Shakespeare's The Tempest is often read as an exploration of colonialism. Questions of agency and justice hang over the play. Will Ariel flutter free? Is there some deeper magic at work, beyond any one character's grasp? The question lingers of whether the invader will be able to relinquish his grip."
"The Tempest is set on a desert island, exposed to the elements and ruled with magic and might by  Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan. In many ways Prosperos actions echo that of the great entertainer himself, who hatched elaborate plots, maneuvered those around him, and cast a spell over characters and audience alike."
"Without a foundation, buildings this heavy would sink, fall, or lean over. To prevent the wind from rocking tower tops, many skyscrapers employ a counterweight weighing hundreds of tons called a tuned mass damper The Taipei 101, for instance, has suspended a giant metal orb above the 87th floor."
"In 1956, Frank Lloyd Wright proposed a milehigh tower. Today, bigger and bigger buildings are going up around the world. The Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia is three times the size of the Eiffel Tower. The higher we build, the higher the gravitational pressure from the upper stories."
"Austens dry wit and cheeky playfulness informs her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers with a conspiratorial wink. These headstrong heroines provide an entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narratives. Their complexity has kept Austen  prominent on stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable for modern sensibilities."
"Jane Austens novels decode the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England. Austen dismissed the sentimental style of writing so popular at the time. Instead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally,  and often awkwardly. Though her heroines might ridicule social mores, Austen fully understood the practical  importance of maintaining appearances."
"The brain has the ability to pay attention to specific objects and events. It also controls that focus, shifting it from one thing to another, internal and external, according to our needs. To control focus effectively, the brain has to construct a model of its own attention. Scientists have begun trying to figure out how the brain creates that self model."
"Ariel exemplifies the honesty and imagination Plath harnessed to capture her pain. Scientists, theologians, and philosophers have been trying to get to the bottom of  this question for centuries. One recent theory is that consciousness is the brains imperfect picture of its own activity."
"The title poem is one of the most memorable expressions of the elation of creative freedom. It is also full of foreboding imagery, such as a child's cry that melts  in the wall and a red/eye, the cauldron  of morning."
"The universe is expanding at an accelerated rate, according to scientists. The Big Crunch would see the universe collapse into a much smaller space. But the exact shape of the universe, and the amount of dark energy it holds, will determine how fast the universe expands."
"Cosmologists have three possible answers for how our universe will end. The Big Freeze, the Big Rip and the Big Crunch are the most likely scenarios. The outcome of the battle between  these two opposing forces determines how the end of the universe will play out."
"Hermann Rorschach published his coding system alongside the ten blots he felt gave the most nuanced picture of peoples perceptual approach. By the 1960s, it had been officially administered  millions of times in the U.S. alone."
"The Rorschach Test was invented in the early 20th century by a Swiss psychiatrist. The mysterious images were said to draw out the workings of a persons mind. Today, the test is still controversial, and many people assume it has been disproven. But a massive 2013 review of all the existing Rorshach research showed that when administered properly the test yields valid results."
"In 1963, Rustin helped organize the March on Washington. It was the first major demonstration against racial segregation in the U.S. Since then, he has been involved in a number of other protests. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his role in the march."
"Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting racial segregation in high school. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the peaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. He returned to the United States armed with strategies for peaceful protest, including civil disobedience. He began to work with Martin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As Kings prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor, as well as a"
"Harvey Milk was the first openly gay member of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors. Milk ran for office in the Castro, the heart of the city's gay community. Milk was assassinated in 1978. He left behind three tapes to be played in the event of his death."
"You and your partner will be walking near an electric fence. Your partner will flash you the signal, and exactly 45 seconds later, short out the fence circuit. The moment the first burns out, you light the other end of the second fuse."
"With thousands fleeing the United States to seek asylum in Canada, we quickly saw what it looks like when there are more people who need help than there are resources to help them. Despite millions of dollars being spent to support resettlement efforts, nearly 50 percent of newcomers still don't know that there are free resources."
"Atar is the firstever AIpowered virtual advocate that guides you through your first week in a new city. Just tell Atar what you need help with. Atar will then generate a custom, stepbystep todo list that tells you everything that you need to know."
"We want to help them overcome language, cultural and other barriers that make them feel like they've lost control of their own lives Every minute, 20 people are newly displaced by climate change, economic and political instability. We want to make sure they have the support they need to get back on their feet"
"Ladakh is a highaltitude desert region in northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the Himalayas. As local glaciers shrink because of climate change, people are growing their own. These glaciers come in two types: horizontal and vertical."
"In the wild, glaciers require three conditions to grow: Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time. In the Himalayas, some local cultures have believed for centuries that glaciers are alive. The Earth and the Moon are actually like identical twins. The genetic code of planets is written in the isotopes of the elements."
The Earth and the Moon are not the same size. The Earth is not the only body in the universe that has a giant impact on the Moon. The Moon is the only planet in the solar system that has such a big impact on Earth's orbit.
"The Moon's special connection to Earth was thought to be an accident. The data didn't look like a planet. The planet was weirdly connected to the disk. It looked like making our Moon this way would be an astronomical coincidence. It was hard for everyone to accept the idea that the Moon's connection to the Earth was an accident, he says."
"The Earth would have been like Jupiter after a giant impact. The Earth is so hot, there's no surface. There's just a deep layer of gas that gets denser and denser with depth. We had to get rid of our old way of thinking, and by playing, I could throw away all of the data."
"A planet is a body whose selfgravity is strong enough to give it its rounded shape. Make it hotter and spin it faster, the equator gets bigger and bigger until it reaches a tipping point. It's now broken all the rules of being a planet."
"A synestia is what a planet becomes when heat and spin push it over the limit of a spheroidal shape. The prefix means all together, to emphasize the connection between all of the material. The Moon's special connection to Earth is because the Moon formed inside the Earth when Earth was asynestia."
"Theories of the origin of the Earth and the Moon are flawed, says author. The theory that a Marssized body struck the young Earth has a flaw, he says. He asks: What else am I missing in the world around me?"
"The author's mother used to play music to soothe her when she had the hiccups. The more music she played, the less her symptoms surfaced. She became curious if there were any other cases of medicinal music. She found out there were."
"Gabby Giffords lost her ability to speak, but she was able to sing again. Scientists have found that music causes our brains to release oxytocin and dopamine. Music also affects our heart rate, breathing and pulse rate, as it stimulates blood flow."
"Tourette syndrome is an incurable neurological disorder that affects about one in every 1,000 people. The condition can be treated with medication, but it can also be cured with surgery. The disorder affects the body's ability to control its own involuntary movements."
"How can you cut the blob entirely into acute triangles and stop it from destroying the planet? Pause the video now  to figure out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 While this seems doable at first, theres a hidden difficulty when it comes to avoiding obtuse and right angles."
"After each hour, it goes to sleep, forming itself into a flat triangle and resting for a few minutes before it begins eating and growing again. Your only chance to save the planet involves a satellitemounted nanofission ray that can cut through the blob. When the blog is active it heals itself within seconds. The acute triangle portion, with all angles less than 90 degrees, is inert. It never wakes up"
"The distinction between pyramid schemes and legitimate multilevel marketing can be particularly hazy. Vemma Nutritions offer was open to everybody, regardless of prior experience or education. The first few members are encouraged  to report a good experience before they actually start  making a profit."
"Vemma Nutrition was founded in 2004 by a group of friends. The company recruited people to work for them. The group made $200,000 a year, but most of the money went back to the founders. The founder died in 2011."
Kahlo painted a series of selfportraits after her death in 1954. Her work shows a woman caught between the past and the present. The Two Frida is a portrait of a woman with a broken heart and a broken leg.
"Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera both suffered from anxiety disorders. One in 14 people around the world have an anxiety disorder, and each year, it costs over 42 billion dollars to treat this mental health problem. anxiety can lead to depression, school dropout, suicide, and relationship breakdown."
"Anxiety helps us meet our deadlines at work and deal with emergencies in life. But when this anxiety emotion is taken to the extreme and arises in situations which don't pose a real threat, that's when you might have an anxiety disorder. In spite of whatever kind of anxiety you might be suffering from, there is something that you can do to lower it."
"People who feel like they're more in control of their life have better mental health. Research shows that you should engage in experiences that give you greater control. A way to overcome indecision and this lack of control in life, is to do it badly."
"Anxiety sufferers should forgive themselves for mistakes they've made in the past. Having a purpose and meaning in life is a very important coping mechanism. If we don't do something with someone else in mind, then we're at much higher risk for poor mental health."
"Do something with someone else in mind to improve your mental health. This could be volunteering, or sharing this knowledge that you gained today with other people. These are often the people who don't have money for therapy, and they're usually the ones with the highest rates of anxiety disorders."
"Every Pomeranian, Chihuahua, and Poodle are descended from fierce wolves. When our Paleolithic ancestors first  settled Eurasia, wolves were one of their main rivals at the top of the food chain. Thousands of years of coevolution may even have bonded us chemically."
"25 Trump supporters from Alabama and 25 Clinton supporters from California met in a Facebook group. They were asked what they thought the other side thought of them. Trump supporters: They think we are religious Bible thumpers. That we're backwards and hickish, and stupid"
"CNN's John Sutter says he's seen a shift in the way people talk to each other. Sutter: Too often we've gone to each side with a telling lead and a pithy final quote But our dialoguebased process has a slower pace and a different center, he says."
"At every stage, we're as transparent as possible about our methods and our motives. We tell people that it's not a trap: no one's there to tell you you're stupid. And we always ask for a different sort of behavior, a repatterning away from namecalling."
Spaceship Media is a group of journalists from across the U.S. The group is dedicated to engaging with people of different political views. They say it is difficult but important to engage with people from different backgrounds. The women of Spaceship Media have formed their own Facebook groups to discuss issues.
"CNN's John Sutter and the Alabama Media Group want to change the way we talk to one another. Sutter: We live in a world in which cousins and aunts and uncles can't talk to each other This is a salve that our democracy sorely needs, says Sutter."
"Criminal justice can be a revolving door for people with cognitive impairments. We're not treating the brain injury, we're treating the underlying problem that gets people into all of this trouble in the first place We do quick neuropsychological screening tests to identify strengths and weaknesses in the way an inmate thinks"
"Inmates write letters to the court with recommendations on how to manage themselves. The inmates move from I'm a total screwup, I'm a loser, to Here's what I don't do well The system comes to see an inmate's problematic behavior as the things they can't do."
"Vinny was hit by a car when he was 15, and from that moment forward, spent more time in jail than in school. He now carries a calendar to avoid being held in contempt for missed court dates. Thomas has some significant attention and behavior problems after an injury landed him in a coma for more than a month."
CNN's John Sutter meets a man with a traumatic brain injury. Sutter: I've come to recognize these inmates as surprisingly among the most vulnerable members of society Sutter says the program will change the way people think about the criminal justice system.
"In 2015, 25 teams from around the world competed to build robots for disaster response. They could perform a number of tasks, such as using a power tool, working on uneven terrain and driving a car. Actuators are for robots what muscles are for animals: key components of the body."
"HASEL artificial muscles are gentle enough to pick up a raspberry without damaging it. They can expand and contract like real muscle. HUBO is trying to get out of a car, and keep in mind, the video is sped up three times."
"HASELs can be used for very precise movement, but they can also deliver very fluidic, musclelike movement and bursts of power to shoot up a ball into the air. When submerged in oil, HASEL artificial muscles can be made invisible. They're based on very inexpensive, easily available materials."
"HASEL stands for hydraulically amplified selfhealing electrostatic actuators HUBO, from team KAIST out of Korea, is a stateoftheart robot with impressive capabilities. The only change is to replace the force of your hand or the weight with an electrical force."
"Soft robotics will enable a new generation of more lifelike prosthetics for people who have lost parts of their bodies. Soft robotics is a very young field. We're just getting started. One day, we may even merge our bodies with robotic parts."
"The human body makes extensive use of soft and deformable materials such as muscle and skin. We've made good progress with the brains of robots, but their bodies are still primitive. We can improve the quality of life for all of us if we do this right."
"In the 1600s the Dutch East India Company employed hundreds of ships to trade gold, porcelain, spices,  and silks around the globe. In order to fund their expensive voyages, the company turned to private citizens individuals who could invest money to support the trip in exchange for a share of the ships profits. Selling these shares in coffee houses and shipping ports across the continent, the DutchEastIndiaCompany unknowingly invented the world's first stock market."
"The modern stock market is significantly more complicated than its original incarnation. The market is a place for companies to advertise themselves to big investors. If they think the company is a good idea, they get the first crack at investing, and then sponsor the companys initial  public offering."
"In China, where I spend a lot of time, the conversation is totally different. The entire economic team, all the way up to president Xi Jinping himself, talk very specifically and clearly about financial risks as gray rhinos. I wonder if we've learned anything in the last 10 years."
"The US has a very individualist culture  go it alone. And paradoxically, this makes many Americans much less open to change. If you think that someone around you is going to help pick you up when you fall, you're much more likely to see a danger."
"People in China are more likely to take risks because they think they can rely on the government. But in fact, the government is trying to keep people from taking risks. The people who take risks are the ones who have the power to change things."
"CNN's John Defterios: We have an opportunity to change our attitudes, our own and those of people around us If you don't see what's in front of you, you're either dumb or ignorant, he says. Once we all recognize that shared vulnerability, that gives us the power to open our eyes"
"The idea of generations has become deeply embedded in U.S. culture. The stereotypes about each generation have, in a lot of ways, created this selffulfilling prophecy. Different areas of the world define these generations differently, so we can't even compare generations across various areas."
"CNN's John Sutter has been talking to leaders and followers across a wide variety of organizations for five years. Sutter: I learned that baby boomers are conservative, that Americans think they're stupid. The worst generation, they're angry, apparently they're racist and they're so important Sutter says Generation Z is screwed."
"CNN's John Defterios is the host of This Is Life on CNN.com. He talks about his new series, This is Life, which airs on Sundays at 8 p.m. ET. Defterio: It's about life, it's not about death"
"For the first time in America's modern history, we have five generations interacting at work. millennials appreciate competition, they love effective communication. How to navigate the multigenerational workplace ... is shoulder pads? I don't even want to work here, one millennial said."
"People want work that matters, flexibility, support, appreciation, they want better coffee. But none of these things are tied to a generation. We have to figure out how to better navigate this multigenerational workplace than ball pits"
"Nilofer Merchant: We have to meet people in their onlyness, that is, that spot in the world where only we stand. Merchant: What happens when we learn that that boomer who is just acting angry at work all the time is scared."
"We're not talking about a generation anymore. We're working with people. And that doesn't require that we unpack and live there with them We all come to the classroom, to work, back to our homes, a little bit tattered sometimes. But we might find, at least on occasion, it's a beautiful place to visit"
"millennials are the most represented generation in the workforce. They're incredibly pragmatic, they're hopeful and they're determined. They think they're going to change the world, in fact, I believe theyre going to do it. They also were the first generation to tell us about worklife balance."
"Integrated photonics is a new way to guide light in data centers. The chips convert electrical signals to optical and back. Light can be guided not only in optical fibers, but also in ultrathin silicon wires. Photonic chips can help break open  wireless bandwidth limitations, too."
"In 2012, a team of Japanese and Danish researchers set a world record, transmitting 1 petabit of data thats 10,000 hours of highdef video over a fiftykilometer cable, in a second. The trick lies in a phenomenon known  as total internal reflection."
"The Cthulhu Mythos is a shared universe of horror stories written by Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecrafts work has inspired numerous short stories, novels, tabletop games, and cultural icons. Despite his literary legacy, Lovecraft was never able to find financial success."
"At the Mountains of Madness is written as a report of an Antarctic expedition that unearths things better left undiscovered. Like thenrecent discoveries of  subatomic particles or Xrays, the forces in Lovecrafts fiction were powerful, yet often invisible and indescribable."
The Weeknd's first live concert in five years took place in London. The show was a collaboration between The Weeknd and the London Opera House. The production team used origamistyle paper origami to create the show's opening scene.
"Es Devlin: With U2, we're navigating the audience over a terrain that spans three decades of politics, poetry and music. For the British band Take That, we ended the show by sending an 80foot high mechanical human figure out to the center of the crowd."
"The UK Pavilion at the World Expo 2020 will be the first of its kind in the UK. The Pavilion will feature a series of portraits of people from around the world. The work is part of a larger project called Poem Portraits, which will take place next year."
"In his lifetime, it's never felt this divided, he says. These are simple experiments in machine learning. The algorithm that generates the collective poem is pretty simple. It's like predictive text, only it's trained on millions of words written by poets in the 19th century."
"Most of what I've made over the last 25 years doesn't exist anymore. But our work endures in memories, in synaptic sculptures. I want to end with some lines that I learnt by heart a long time ago. They're written by the English novelist E.M. Forster, in 1910."
"An AI program running in the background tries to figure out what the user's trying to say. It then feeds back an answer to the user by means of bone conduction, audio conducted through the skull. The combination of all these parts, the input, the output and the AI, gives a net subjective experience."
"Scientists have created an artificial intelligence that can speak to itself. The technology could one day be used to help people with disabilities. The project is being led by the University of California, San Diego. It is the first time computers have been able to speak to themselves in real time."
"I want to help people communicate with each other in a new way, he says. I want people to be able to say, 'I'm here, I want to talk to you,' he adds. That's what we're trying to do. We're not trying to replace people, we're just helping them."
"Aims to read thoughts from the voluntary nervous system, while still bringing the benefits of a thinking or a thought device. The best of both worlds in a way. Integrate human and machine intelligence right inside our own bodies to augment us, instead of diminishing us."
"AlterEgo is a wearable device that gives you the experience of a conversational AI that lives inside your head. It's a new prototype that we're showing here, for the first time at TED, and here's how it works. We have a sticker version that conforms to the skin, but we're trying to make an even smaller version."
"According to the World Health Organization, we need to average about 2.1 children per woman today. Fewer younger working people means less tax revenue for the U.S., China, Japan, Germany. There's going to be a domino effect as we get older, and live longer."
"CNN's John Sutter takes a trip back to 1980, when China's onechild policy was implemented. Sutter: China's birth rates have largely declined, removing one of its biggest drivers of growth. Japan is now producing more adult diapers than infant ones, Sutter says."
"In developed countries, people are having fewer babies. Japan has introduced two solutions. Some local governments in Japan have offered couples money to have babies. Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbn has proposed a new solution to try to incentivize people to have kids."
"Orbn says he wants to limit the population of Muslims and people of color. He said families where the women have four or more kids will no longer pay income tax. Over the past 50 years, the global fertility rate has halved."
"In India, women have more access to birth control, more control over their reproductive lives. But in the United States, in particular, a lot of young people are opting out of having kids, largely cite the same reason: financial concerns. The United States is the most expensive country in the world to give birth."
"France reported the highest birth rates in the EU in 2017. Largely due to its pronatal policies that actually kept women in the workforce. China and Japan, thank God, are finally wisening up and proposing such policies. This is great. I know many of you in this audience want to have babies but you are terrified about the future."
CNN's John Defterios is the host of This Is Life on CNN.com. He says he and his wife decided to have children because they were the right thing to do. Defterio's wife was diagnosed with stage IV liver cancer.
"Babies have always represented humanity's best, boldest, most beautiful infinite possibilities. And if we in developed countries, as a whole, opt out, and don't invest in present and future generations, then what's the point? And so, for those who can and who choose to, may you pass on this beautiful thing called life, with kindness, generosity, decency and love."
"The MachZehnder modulator splits waves of light along two parallel arms and eventually rejoins them. By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, emitting pulses of light. The first generation of automobile LIDAR has relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods."
A selfdriving cars LIDAR system uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the  button on a pedestrianS shirt across the street. LIDar is a special kind of laserbased probe.
"The sloth is the world's slowest mammal. But like The Beatles, sloths are also extremely successful. They live in the jungles of Central and South America, and are extremely prolific. So what if, rather than deriding the sloth for being different, we tried to learn from it instead?"
"We idolize animals like the cheetah, the Ferrari of the animal kingdom The sloth, on the other hand, can reach a leisurely 17 feet a minute with the wind behind it. They survive by capturing and consuming static leaves."
Sloths have the slowest digestion rate of any mammal. They can take up to a month to process a single leaf. They do about 10 percent of the work of a similarsized mammal and survive on as little as 100 calories a day. They have more neck bones than any other mammal.
"Sloths have long, hooked claws and a high fatigue resistance, so they can literally hook on and hang like a happy, hairy hammock for hours on end. Their throat and blood vessels are uniquely adapted to pump blood and to swallow food against the force of gravity. They have sticky bits on their ribs that prevent their enormous stomach from crushing their lungs."
"Sloths are stealth ninjas, rarely leave the safety of the canopy, except to defecate. Their fur has grooves that attract moisture and act as tiny hydroponic gardens for algae. Their lack of muscle hasn't impeded their strength or agility."
"Sloths are generally silent, solitary creatures, except for when the female is in heat. So the female remains covert, even when yodeling for sex at the top of her lungs. Her clandestine booty calls will carry for miles across the canopy, and males will beat a slow path towards her."
"Sloths have been around on this planet in one shape or another for over 40 million years. The secret to their success is their slothful nature. They are energysaving icons. I founded the Sloth Appreciation Society to both promote and protect their slow, steady, sustainable lives."
"The brain weighs the importance  of these signals and produces pain if it decides the body needs protection. Psychological factors clearly  play a role in pain too, potentially by influencing nociception and by influencing the brain directly. A persons emotional state, memories, beliefs about pain and expectations  about treatment can all influence how much pain they experience."
"pain specialists, physical therapists, clinical psychologists, nurses and other healthcare professionals are often most effective. Were only beginning to uncover the mechanisms behind the experience of pain, but there are some promising areas of research. Studies have shown that disabling certain brain circuits in the amygdala can eliminate pain in rats."
"Sea lions use a sixth sense to find their prey. Their whiskers are composed of nerve fibers that run deep into the connective tissue of their face. They can remember multiple hunting grounds, including those they havent visited in decades. But as climate change warms the oceans,  certain toxic algae species thrive."
"The sea lion is able to cope with pressure by collapsing its rib cage and compressing a pair of springy lungs. The more we can learn about the sea lion, the better equipped we will be to help it thrive. The sea lion can hunt for up to 30 hours at a time."
"I didn't get a lot of the jobs people were willing to see me for I wanted to play people who were complex and multidimensional, she says. I trained my whole life for this, I'll just follow the playbook, she adds."
"Real Women Have Curves is a film about a Latina woman trying to find her place in the world. The film is based on a true story of a woman's struggle to find a place in society. We proved our stories have value. We proved that people want to see people like us, says the actress."
"Malala is the first and only Latina to ever win an Emmy in a lead category. Malala: I have witnessed the power our voices have when they can access presence in the culture Who we see thriving in the world teaches us how to see ourselves, Malala says."
"Some of us can access presence in the culture, and some can't. We cannot deny it  presence creates possibility. We can't deny that our stories don't have an audience, our experiences won't resonate in the mainstream, our voices are too big a financial risk."
"I didn't need my dream to be easy, I just needed it to be possible I am just one of millions of people who have been told that in order to fulfill my dreams, I have to resist the truth Change will come when each of us has the courage to question our own fundamental values"
The author of the novel The Master and Margarita says he is what the world looks like. He worked on the novel for over ten years. The author says the novel shows how Soviet society bred greed and cynicism despite its ideals. The novel was published under strict censorship.
"Bulgakovs experiences with censorship and artistic frustration lend an autobiographical air to the second part of the novel. Despite its dark humor and complex structure, The Master and Margarita is, at its heart, a meditation on art, love, and redemption."
"Ilyse Hogue: Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. She says confidence is the difference between being inspired and actually getting started. I dream a world where revolutionary confidence helps bring about our most ambitious dreams into reality, Hogue says."
"Jamal would squirm in his chair during independent work, and he would never stay still for more than three or four minutes. He never wanted to read what he had written out loud in class, but we were still making progress. One day, he finally decided to read something out loud. The entire class erupted into applause."
"When I was a little girl, a book sat on the coffee table in our living room, just steps from our front door. I have literally prayed that I did not do irreparable harm, says the teacher. A lack of confidence pulls us down from the bottom and weighs us down, she says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the importance of confidence in the workplace. Sutter: If you don't have confidence, you're not doing your job properly He says it's important to have confidence in yourself and your ability to do things well."
"I want to tattoo her response all over my entire body. She would never be afraid to walk away. Her confidence was propped up by sisterhood, she says. They remind me that we will be better than these men"
"In community, I can find my confidence and your curiosity can affirm it, she says. Curiosity invites people to be in charge of their own learning. Permission, community, curiosity: all of these are the things that we will need to solve our greatest challenges."
"Bacteria live everywhere, in all sorts of diverse and extreme environments. Researchers estimate there are roughly five million trillion trillion  that's a five with 30 zeros after it  bacteria on the planet. By 2050, researchers estimate that there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish."
"PET plastic is the most widely produced plastic in the world. It's used in all sorts of food and drink containers, with the most notorious example being plastic water bottles. Despite our best efforts, only nine percent of all plastic we use winds up being recycled."
"Researchers estimate that it can take anywhere from 500 to 5,000 years to fully break down. The bacteria in my research are not genetically modified frankenbugs. These are naturally occurring bacteria that have adapted to their plasticpolluted environment and evolved the incredibly gnarly ability to eat PET plastic."
"Bacteria may be able to help solve our plastic pollution problem. Bacteria can thrive in a contained system, where their sole food source is PET plastic waste. Plasticeating bacteria is not a cureall. But given the current statistics, it's clear that we humans could use a little help."
"The average U.S. person ate more than 200 pounds of meat last year. John Sutter: We need to produce more meat from plants. He says it takes six weeks to grow a chicken, but in six days we can produce meat. Sutter says we need to grow the meat ourselves."
"Plantbased and cellbased meat gives consumers everything that they love about meat. It has no need for antibiotics and with a fraction of the adverse impact on the climate. These two technologies are so much more efficient, at production scale these products will be cheaper."
"Climate change, antibiotic resistance  these are global emergencies. Meat production is exacerbating these emergencies on a global scale. We are feeding massive doses of antibiotics to farm animals. These antibiotics are then mutating into superbugs that threaten to render antibiotics obsolete within all of our lifetimes."
"About 10% of seafood caught globally is used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish. 33% of wild fisheries are overfished, while another 60% are fished at their maximum capacity. Manmade coastal ponds commonly used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia create additional environmental problems."
"regenerative ocean farming could play a vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves. In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can produce 25 tons of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish. With the right distribution network, a series of small farms, collectively  the size of Washington State could feed the planet."
"The brain of an octopus is made up of 80 million tiny cells. The brain is used to send signals to other parts of the body. This is a very unusual way to construct a nervous system in a body. It's also a way to communicate with other animals, such as sharks."
"Decisionmaking is one of the things that this brain has to do, and it does a very good job of it. The squids have an extremely complex, interesting sex life. They have fighting and flirting and courting and mateguarding and deception."
"The cuttlefish has a very good memory and spatial memory. The octopus on a coral reef has a tough job in front of it to go to so many places, remember and find its den. It takes a lot of brain power to do this."
"The brain of an octopus is very different from the brain of a vertebrate. It has a different evolutionary pathway to create intelligence on planet Earth. The last common denominator in these lines was 600 million years ago, and it was a worm with very few neurons."
"The octopus is able to edit its RNA at an astronomical rate, a hundredfold more than we as humans or other animals do. The nervous system produces scores of proteins, and most of them are for the nervous system. The total sensory immersion into that world is what helps us understand what these animals are really doing."
"The cuttlefish has smooth skin and a conspicuous pattern that morphs into iridescence. The pattern is made up of tiny bumps called papillae, which can be manipulated to create finetuned, neurally controlled camouflage. Scientists at Cornell have made the first samples of artificial papilla, soft materials."
The color of the cephalopods' skin is controlled by neurally controlled pigments and reflectors. The discovery of lightsensing molecules in the skin of octopus may pave the way to smart materials that sense and respond on their own.
"A witch hunt often began with a misfortune: a failed harvest, a sick cow, or a stillborn child. Community members blamed witchcraft, and accused each other of being witches. Many of the accused were people on the fringes of society: the elderly, the poor, or social outcasts."
Witch hunts began in Europe in the 15th century and spread to the U.S. in the 1800s. They were started by people who believed they were protected by God. But they were actually a way of mobilizing people to fight back against evil.
Researchers are finding ways to trick the immune system into accepting new devices we introduce into our bodily tissues. coating implants with certain chemicals and drugs can dampen the immune response. Were also making more implants out of natural materials and in forms that directly mimic tissues.
"Insulin pumps improve the lives of many of the 415 million people with diabetes around the world. They monitor blood sugar, deliver insulin, and prevent the need for constant fingerpricking and blood testing. Other implants, such as those used for  cosmetic reasons, can meet the same fate in about 10."
"CNN's John Sutter interviewed dozens of brave and unusual hosts to better understand what creates meaningful and even transformative gatherings. The first step of creating more meaningful everyday gatherings is to embrace a specific disputable purpose, Sutter says. Sutter: When most people plan a gathering, they start with an offtherack format."
The idea of pin the diaper on the baby games and opening gifts felt odd and irrelevant. She realized it was to address her fears of her and her husband's transition to parenthood. The next step of creating more meaningful everyday gatherings is to cause good controversy.
"The best gatherings learn to cultivate good controversy by creating the conditions for it. Human connection is as threatened by unhealthy peace as by unhealthy conflict. We threw white towels around their necks, stolen from the bathroom  sorry  played Rocky music on an iPad, and then made them each argue"
"Popup rules allow us to connect meaningfully, says author. Instead of opinions, ask everybody to share a story from their life and experience. The idea is to give people a way in to each other without burning the house down. For a mom's dinner, if you talk about your kids, you have to take a shot."
"Safia Elhillo: Rules are powerful, because they allow us to temporarily change and harmonize our behavior. She says in diverse societies, popup rules carry special force. How we gather matters because how we gather is how we live, she says."
"Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz is the author of Three Months After The play is based on the play All the World's a Stage by William Shakespeare. Cristin was brought up in a small village called Fillongley, in England."
"I was raised by my grandparents, so I grew up surrounded by history and beautiful things When I get dressed I'm guided by color, texture and shape. I find beautiful objects from all over the world, and I curate them into 3D tapestries over a base layer"
"When I wake up in the morning, I check my phone, and then I have a cup of coffee. It usually takes me about 20 minutes to get ready, which nobody ever believes. When I get dressed, I build like an architect. I carefully place things till I feel they belong."
"I like the fact that the viewer can never make the assumption about what's real and what's fake I use clothing as a means to appreciate people from all over the world. People respond to me as they would any other type of artwork. It may not be like yours, because I live my life as an artwork"
"I've never lived as Daniel Lismore, the person. And I've faced every obstacle as an artwork, he says. I've just learned not to take them personally, he adds. It can be hard, especially if your wardrobe takes up a 40foot container"
"I've had to face struggles and triumphs whilst living my life as art I've been abused, sometimes daily, bullied my entire life, rejected by countless individuals It can be hard, being yourself, but I've found it's the best way"
"The artist says he has lived as art his entire adult life. When I walk out the door, these artworks are me. I am art. That's my life, every day, he says. You should try it sometime. It's quite fun, he adds."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the history of building great monuments. He says the ancient structures were built to be moved, not to stand still. Sutter says we need to rethink the way we build monuments and monuments. I would love to learn how to create something that could entertain for an eternity, he says."
"CNN's David McKenzie takes a look at some of the world's most mysterious rocks. The rocks were created by a race of giants known as Cyclops. They are made up of atoms arranged in a grid, with small sulfur atoms in the middle."
"The shape of a diamond depends on the conditions in which it grows. Diamonds grow into cubes at lower temperatures and octahedrons at higher temperatures. Environmental conditions can also influence whether crystals form at all. Some crystals, like turquoise, dont grow into any discernible geometric shape."
"Every crystals atoms are arranged  in a highly organized, repeating pattern. This pattern is the defining  feature of a crystal, and isnt restricted to minerals. Sand, ice, sugar, chocolate, ceramics, metals, DNA, and even some liquids have crystalline structures."
"Proteins carry out essentially all the important functions in our bodies. We can now design completely new proteins from scratch on the computer. Once we've designed the new protein, we encode its amino acid sequence in a synthetic gene. We then extract the proteins and determine whether they function as we designed them to and whether they're safe."
"Proteins are linear chains of building blocks called amino acids. Proteins can stimulate your immune system to make a strong response against a pathogen. To make better vaccines, we've designed protein particles to which we can fuse proteins from pathogens. These advances are the beginning of the protein design revolution."
The ability to design new vaccines on the computer is important to protect against natural flu epidemics and intentional acts of bioterrorism. We are seeking to attract talented scientists from around the world to accelerate the protein design revolution. We're going far beyond nature's limited alphabet of just 20 amino acids todesign new therapeutic candidates.
"The shapes of proteins, and hence their remarkable functions, are completely specified by the sequence of amino acids in the protein chain. Each protein folds to its characteristic shape each time, and the folding process takes just a fraction of a second. The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles."
A trapped ion quantum computer uses ions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers. The state of the qubit determines whether the ion emits photons and how many photons it emits. Superconducting qubit quantum computers use electrical circuits instead of an ion trap.
"In theory, quantum computers could outstrip the computational limits of classical computers. A quantum computer uses something  called a qubit, which can switch between zero, one, and whats called a superposition. While the qubit is in its superposition, it has a lot more information than one or zero."
"When interviewing for a job, ask what if questions instead of asking about the past. The second trick is to look for signs of unlearning. Active unlearners seek to challenge what they presume to already know, and instead, override that data with new information."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at what it means to be an adaptable person. He says the key to being adaptable is to be willing to try new things. Defterio: It's not about being able to do everything, it's about having the ability to do it well"
"The Blockbuster CEO was too focused on exploiting his already successful business model, so much so that he couldn't see around the next corner. Netflix brought in 15.8 billion dollars, while Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010, directly 10 years after that meeting."
"VCs asses a founder's emotional quotient, or EQ. I have a different methodology to assess startup founders. It's adaptability: how well a person reacts to the inevitability of change. I subscribe to the belief that adaptability itself is a form of intelligence."
"Some historians believe a giant aqueduct was diverted into the arena. Others think the system of chambers  and sluice gates used to drain the arena, were also used to fill it. These chambers couldve been filled  with water prior to the event and then opened to submerge the stage under more than a million gallons of  water."
Sugar is transported from the top of the tree to the roots. Fungi carry the sugar through the roots and into the root system. This is how the ancient Roman Colosseum was built. It was built to show off the power of the Roman Empire.
"Fungus exchange nutrients and sugar with a tree, both parties benefit. The secret to their success lies  under the forest floor, where vast root systems support the towering trunks above. Partnering with these roots are symbiotic fungi called mycorrhizae."
"Through mycorrhizal networks, fungi can pass resources and signaling molecules between trees. An individual tree might be colonized by dozens of different fungal organisms, each of which connects to a  unique set of other trees, which in turn each have their own unique  set of fungal associations. These developments laid the groundwork for the modern field of antibiotics currently home to our most effective TB treatments."
"Tuberculosis is still prevalent in 30 countries, most of which face other health crises that exacerbate TB and trigger latent cases. Traditional treatments can take up to 9 months, requiring multiple drugs and a high potential for side effects. The stigma towards TB can discourage people from getting the help they need."
"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in women. It can take up to 20 years for symptoms to appear. HPV 16 and 18 are the most common strains of cervical cancer. There are three safe, effective vaccines for these strains."
"Most sexually active people will be infected with human papillomavirus, or HPV There are over 100 types of HPV, and most of the time the body eliminates infections without symptoms. Some strains can pose serious  health risks down the line."
"In The Garden of Forking Paths, as Yu Tsun winds his way through  country roads, he remembers a lost labyrinth. Over the course of the story, he finds out the labyrinth is not a  physical maze but a novel. In every instant, there are infinite  possible courses of action. And as one moment follows another, each possibility begets another set of divergent futures."
Galen is credited with solidifying the theory of the Four Humours. He believed the liver constantly produces an endless supply of blood. He also believed that respiration was controlled by muscles and nerves. He penned treatises on everything from anatomy to nutrition.
"In the middle of the 16th century, a talented young anatomist named Andreas Vesalius made a shocking discovery. He discovered that the most famous human anatomy texts in the world were wrong. But who was this towering figure? And why did doctors working more than 1,300 years later so revere him?"
"Policewomen make up just three percent of police chiefs in the United States. Canada, Australia and the UK have nearly twice the amount of policewomen. New Zealand is steadily marching towards their goal of recruit gender parity by 2021. The problem is, the U.S. has nearly 18,000 police agencies."
"Federal courts have stated that men and women simply are not physiologically the same for the purposes of physical fitness programs. The lawenforcement community is admittedly experiencing a recruitment crisis. We can easily recruit more women and reap all those research benefits by training wellqualified candidates to pass validated, workrelated, physiologicallybased fitness exams."
"Nanfu: The dire situation in New Jersey led me to examine the status of women in policing across the U.S. Nanfu: For the past three decades, everyone in my family had to apply for a permission from the government to have a child. I wondered what it was like for people who lived under the onechild policy."
"Midwife said she had performed 60,000 forced abortions and sterilizations. Sometimes, she said, a lateterm fetus would survive an abortion, and she would kill the baby after delivering it. She said she was full of guilt for carrying out the onechild policy."
"The author was born in 1985, six years before China announced its onechild policy. The message seeped into our minds so much so that I grew up feeling embarrassed for having a younger brother. Every society is vulnerable to accepting propaganda as truth, and no society can be truly free."
"Growing up in China, Ellie's parents were forced to have a second child. Ellie says she felt like her family did something wrong for having two children. Ellie has been at HIAS, a Jewish organization that fights for refugee rights, for 16 years."
"People have been fleeing Central America for generations. This is nothing new. What's new is that recently, there's been a spike in families, children and families, showing up at checkpoints. It's not a time to panic. It is a fundamental right in our own laws and in international law."
"Last year, the US resettled fewer refugees than at any time since the program began in 1980. Border guards are telling people when they show up at our borders that our country's full, that they simply can't apply. Our country, our government, has detained over 3,000 children."
"Migration has always been with us, and it always will be. The reasons why people flee  persecution, war, violence, climate change  are only growing. Global cooperation as a response to global migration and displacement would go a long way towards making migration something that just is."
"CNN's Jake Tapper spoke with Ellie Hassenfeld, the granddaughter of a Syrian refugee. She said the stories of her grandparents were no different than today's stories. Tapper: A country shows strength through compassion and pragmatism, not through force."
"Human actions are now releasing 9.4 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere. But half of that is being taken up by land and the seas through a process known as carbon sequestration. We're only experiencing the consequence of 50 percent of our pollution, because the natural ecosystems are bailing us out, he says."
There's more carbon in soil than there is in all of the world's vegetation. Carbon comes into the soil through the process of photosynthesis. Carbon leaves the soil and goes right back up into the atmosphere when the bodies of those formerly living organisms decay in soil.
Soils around the world are experiencing unprecedented rates of degradation through a variety of human actions. Half of the world's soils are currently considered degraded. Peatlands in polar environments store about a third of the global soil carbon reserves. The soil carbon bank in these polar environments built up over hundreds of thousands of years.
"Sally Kohn: When soil thaws, it releases carbon into the atmosphere. She says we need to make sure we use the soil in a way that maximizes its carbon sequestration. Kohn says there is a global effort to increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil."
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere has increased by 40 percent just in the last 150 years or so. Human flu viruses are covered in proteins adapted to bind with matching receptors on human respiratory cells. The virus only needs to suppress or evade the hosts immune system long enough to replicate.
"A virus adapted to another mammal, infecting a human might just take a few lucky mutations. Some viruses come equipped to easily infect a new hosts cells, but are then unable to evade an immune response. Virologists are constantly looking for mutations that might make viruses such as influenza more likely to jump."
"Crossspecies infections have the potential to produce deadly epidemics. Viruses are a type of organic parasite infecting nearly all forms of life. To survive and reproduce, they must move through three stages: contact with a susceptible host, infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals."
"Mongolism was founded in the 12th century and spread to the Middle East and Europe. The most valuable produce was gold brocade, which the Mongols used to clothe their horses and cover their tents. In the 1260s, the Mongol Empire was split into four, with the Chagatai Khanate taking control in Central Asia."
"The Mongols left a legacy of world domination that remains unmatched today. The people herded sheep, cattle,  yaks and camels. They lived in felt tents and moved between summer and winter campsites. Nomadic women held significant authority, managing flocks and trade."
The story of the Giant of the Nile is told through the eyes of a young boy. The story was passed down from generation to generation. It's a story of how a boy's love for his father led him to build a wall to stop other children.
"As technology moves us faster and faster through time and space, it seems like story is getting pushed out of the way. But even as our engagement with stories change, or the trappings around it morph, we must remember our finger beneath the words. We read to get lost, to forget the hard times we're living in, and to remember those who came before us, who lived through something harder."
"CNN's John Sutter grew up in a segregated South Carolina neighborhood. His family was one of many who had not been allowed to learn to read or write. Sutter: For as long as we've been communicating, there's been the layering to the narrative"
"The author reads slowly to pay homage to her ancestors, who were not allowed to read at all. I read slowly to drown out the noise and remember those who came before me, she says. The power of story lives on, she writes."
"Noor was born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian  Muslim father and an American mother. In June 1943 she landed  in Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed with a false passport, a pistol and a few French francs. Protected only by her quick  thinking and charisma, she frequently talked her way  out of questioning."
"Despite being tortured,  deprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away. In the moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted Libert! She has been honoured as a hero who waged secret battles behind enemy lines."
"When she was 10 years old, a boy in her family asked her to wash the dishes after dinner. She felt this was unjust, unfair and discriminatory, so she wanted to discuss it in the meeting. Her brothers argued that none of the other boys we knew were washing the dishes, so why should our family be any different?"
"Politicians should include people from different backgrounds, interests, opinions, gender, beliefs, race, ethnicity, age, and so on, she says. The idea of politics and political engagement has become so polarized in many parts of the world, she adds."
"Libya is not a place where political engagement by women and young people is possible, nor encouraged. Almost all political dialogues that took place in the past few years have been with only middleaged men in the room. In places with a broken political system like Libya, or in seemingly functioning places, political decisionmaking is not from the people for the people."
"Every family is its own mini political system that is usually not democratic. Parents make decisions that affect all members of the family, while the kids have very little to say. Similarly, politicians make decisions which affect the whole nation, while people have little say in them."
"The Hindu Kush Himalaya region is the world's thirdlargest repository of ice, after the North and South Poles. Even the Paris Agreement's ambitious targets aimed to limit global warming to two degrees centigrade is what they call the bestcase scenario."
"Nepal's glaciers are melting, says Nepalese Prime Minister. The glaciers are more vulnerable than previously thought, he says. That would have the potential to literally destroy our land, our livelihood, our way of life, he adds. The report kept him awake at night."
"Bhutan's prime minister has warned that his country could drown unless we control global warming. Bhutan has 240 million people who live in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region. Global warming means that our mountains receive more rain and less snow, Bhutan's PM says."
"10 of Asia's major rivers originate in the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains. These rivers provide critical water for agriculture and drinking water to more than 1.6 billion people. That's one in five humans. When glaciers melt, when monsoons turn severe, those rivers will flood."
"We know that we face drastic and dramatic change. And right now, with our glaciers melting, the region is not just sick, he says. We don't care until we are personally affected. And how will it affect the rest of the world? he asks."
"Nepal's prime minister held his cabinet meeting on Mount Everest. We've made immense sacrifices to act locally ... and while individual localized efforts will continue to be important, they cannot stand up to the onslaught of climate change We have to work together, because thinking globally, acting locally ... does not work, he says."
"Rising sea levels could well drown the Maldives. While they can hold their cabinet meetings underwater to send an SOS to the world, their country can keep existing only if their islands keep existing. He took all his ministers all the way up to the base camp of Everest to warn the world that Himalayan glaciers were melting."
"Scotland, Iceland and New Zealand have joined the Wellbeing Economy Governments group. The aim of the group is to challenge the narrow measurement of GDP. The group's aim is to focus on how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a country is."
"Scotland is leading the way in promoting wellbeing in the UK, says the Prime Minister. Scotland is one of three countries in the Wellbeing Network The other two are New Zealand and Iceland, both of which are leading in the area of mental health."
"Scotland is helping to lead the world into the low carbon age, says Alex Salmond. Salmond: I want Scotland to be the country that helps change the focus of countries and governments across the world What we choose to measure as a country matters, he says, and we play our part in building a fairer, happier world"
"In the early days of table tennis, the sport was dominated by the AustroHungarians. In the 1950s, a Japanese player called Hiroji Satoh took the game by storm. Today, the game is dominated by players from Japan and other Asian countries."
"In Japan, a game of pingpong is really like an act of love. You're learning how to play with somebody, rather than against her. In Japan, unlike elsewhere, if the score is still level after four hours, a baseball game ends in a tie. A team with quite a few ties can finish ahead of a team with more victories."
"Playing pingpong in Japan can feel quite a lot like that point that was said to last two hours and 12 minutes. The opposite of winning isn't losing  it's failing to see the larger picture. Playing doubles in Japan really relieves me of all my anxiety, and at the end of an evening, I notice everybody is filing out in a more or less equal state of delight."
"Photographs taken in Japan, Germany, China and the U.S. in the 1990s and 2000s. The work is a historical document, a time capsule that can teach us not only about migration, but about society and ourselves. The best way to win any game, Japan tells me every other night, is never to think about the score."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to Mexico to document the plight of the country's undocumented workers. He met a group of men who were living on the streets, waiting for a job. Defterio: It has taught me how we treat our most vulnerable residents"
"Photographer Juan Carlos Varela took this photo of a migrant family in the streets of Mexico in the 1990s. The family was protesting against daylabor agencies, which were blackballing them. The image is one of his favorite photographs of the past 20 years."
"At the time, Lupe's family lived in the insular world of the Back of the Yards, a tightknit Chicago neighborhood. The family did the thankless hidden jobs that most people didn't want to do: cleaning office buildings, preparing airline meals in cold factories."
My work is firmly rooted in my own family's history of exile and subsequent rebirth in the United States. The longstanding legacy of the US government's involvement in Latin America is controversial and welldocumented. The 1954 CIAbacked coup of rbenz in Guatemala and the IranContra scandal are all examples of this complex history.
The border has become more militarized since 9/11. The people we photograph become a part of our collective history. We never really know which particular moment will stay with us or which particular person will be with us. We are all part of the same story.
The father of a young girl was killed by a bullet while crossing the border into the United States. The girl's father was killed while trying to protect his daughter. The father's death is one of many instances of people fleeing violence in the U.S. to escape.
"The Argonauts sailed to the Mount of Bears, an island where a group of ancient,  sixarmed monsters lived alongside the peaceful Doliones. While the clan welcomed the Argonauts with open arms, the monsters surged down from the mountains and hurled rocks at the docked ship. Hercules held them off singlehandedly, before his comrades joined the fray."
"The story of how a group of men and women came to be known as the Red Army is told in the book The Red Army of the Redeemer The Red Army was formed in 17th century by a group called the White Army. It was led by the legendary King George III, who ruled from 1776 to 1783."
"Four million outofschool girls in India, one of the highest in the world. Girls are out of school because of, obviously poverty, social, cultural factors. But there's also this underlying factor of mindset. And it is this mindset that keeps girls from school."
"Educate Girls works in some of the most difficult, rural, remote and tribal villages. The first piece we do is about identifying every single girl who's not going to school. The way we do it is a little different and hightech, at least in my view. Each of our frontline staff have a smartphone."
We use data and technology to find out where the girls are and bring them back to school. We also make sure that schools have all the basic infrastructure so that the girls will be able to stay. We know that our model works because a most recent randomized control evaluation confirms its efficacy.
The World Bank says that girls' education is one of the best investments that a country can make. Five percent of villages in India have 40 percent of the outofschool girls. The program helps to positively impact nine of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
"Every single girl I meet wants to go to school. We want to be able to fulfill those 1.6 million dreams. To find and enroll a girl with our model is about 20 dollars. To make sure that she is learning and providing a learning program, it's another 40 dollars."
"Hans, Sophie and Willi Schmorell grew up in Germany during the Nazi era. They were forced to work for the national effort, and Hans had to take on army duties. In secret, they began drafting leaflets urging readers to renounce Hitler."
"In June 1942, mysterious antiNazi leaflets began appearing all over Munich. The first leaflet denounced Hitler and called for Germans to sabotage the war effort. The White Rose worked feverishly from June 1942 to February 1943. News of their message even reached concentration camps and prisons."
"Hans and Sophie Scholl were teenagers in Forchtenberg, Germany. They were sentenced to death by guillotine after confessing to the Gestapo. Before her execution, Sophie declared her fury at the state of her country. She also spoke to a more hopeful future."
"More than 17,000 Europeans from 33 countries signed up to have a political argument. Thousands crossed their borders to meet a stranger with a different opinion. They were all part of a project called Europe Talks The filter bubble has always been there. It's in our minds."
Deutschland Talks is a new online dating service. It allows users to meet people who disagree with them. The service is free and open to the public. It was created in response to the election of Donald Trump as Germany's president.
"After one day, 1,000 people had registered. After some weeks, 12,000 Germans had signed up to meet someone else with a different opinion. And the two had never met before. They only knew that they were totally at odds over European politics."
"CNN's Nina dos Santos met with AfD spokesman Mirko in Berlin's trendy Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. She found out that in his teenage years, Mirko used to be a neoNazi. The pair argued for almost one day about women's rights and abortion."
"The first Germany Talks took place in Berlin in June. The event was organized by the German government and 11 major German media houses. More than 28,000 people applied to take part in this year's event. It was the first time the participants had met each other."
"My Country Talks has already been used for more than a dozen local and national events. Twothirds of the participants said that they learned something about their partner's attitudes. The level of trust in society seemed also higher after the event, according to researchers."
"Rana Ayyub's life was turned upside down by a cybermob attack. Her online accounts were flooded with screenshots of the video. Her home address and her cell phone number were spread across the internet. The video was shared more than 40,000 times."
"Deepfake technology manipulates or fabricates audio and video recordings to show people doing and saying things that they never did or said. Deepfakes appear authentic and realistic, but they're not; they're total falsehoods. The most recent attention to deepfakes arose, as so many things do online, with pornography."
"Researchers have found that online hoaxes spread 10 times faster than accurate stories. We tend to believe and to share information that's negative and novel. And we're attracted to the salacious, the provocative. Deepfakes have the potential to cause grave individual and societal harm."
"Deepfakes can exploit and magnify the deep distrust that we already have in politicians, business leaders and other influential leaders. They find an audience primed to believe them. Technologists expect that with advances in AI, soon it may be difficult to tell the difference between a real video and a fake one."
"Law is not up to the challenge of deepfakes, says professor. Law is our educator. It teaches us about what's harmful and what's wrong. And it shapes behavior it deters by punishing perpetrators and securing remedies for victims. We're going to need a healthy dose of societal resilience."
"Law professor, lawyer and civil rights advocate says law is not a cureall. Law enforcers are not going to enforce laws they don't know about. Education has to be part of our response as well, he says. It's incredibly frustrating knowing that right now, law could do very little to help"
"Rana Ayyub is still wrestling with the fallout of the fake sex video. She still feels like there are thousands of eyes on her naked body. She has frequent panic attacks, especially when someone she doesn't know tries to take her picture."
"The fake sex video went viral in 48 hours. We take pictures of the city at night and study city lights like stars. In daytime images, we capture plumes of pollution. Seventyfive percent of greenhouse gases in New York City come from a building."
"Astrophysicist and public policy professor created a dashboard for DAs to see and better understand the prosecution process. They also analyzed their data, looking to see if the duration of the process suffered from social inequalities in their jurisdiction. I bring my astrophysics background to urban science, and I bring what I learn in urban science back to astrophysics."
"I think there's a problem with the way women feel about themselves, says author. We need to change the way we feel about ourselves, she says. It's OK to feel bad about yourself, she adds, but it's not OK to act on it"
We've been fighting for fat acceptance and women's body autonomy since the '60s. But many fashion designers continue to reinforce this narrow definition of beauty. Differentsize bodies aren't taken into account during the design process. The conversation around exclusivity in fashion doesn't begin and end with size.
"We wanted to celebrate all body types, says the designer. It's important to include people of color in the fashion industry, she says. We don't want to just be a fashion brand, we want to be part of the community"
Fashion designer Krystian Aparta says fashion needs to be more diverse. She says Nordstrom's recent order of 3X clothing was a game changer. Aparta: I want the consumer to know that it's not your body that needs to change  it's the clothes
"It's impossible not to be bombarded with images of models that have been photoshopped to where there's not a single pore, fat roll or stretch mark in sight I wanted to be like the models, so I stopped eating. It took me years to finally release the grip that the models had on my life"
CNN's John Sutter looks at how the brain processes information. He says the brain is divided into two parts: the neurodiverse and the nervous side. Sutter: What is the neural network that is helping to build these different discrepancies?
"Linguist discovers the secret of human intimacy. Turn your back to your partner and place your back upon their back  you eliminate visual cues. You are more readily available to failing first, and failing first far outweighs the lengths we go to to appeal to others."
"Anthony Veneziale: We don't want to just sit on the couch. We want to get up and circumvent sometimes that couch On a molecular level, I believe that that insight is the unifying theme for every talk you have seen so far"
"The human heart is imbued with metaphor and meaning, says Anthony Veneziale. In the Roman Catholic Church, the heart shape became known as the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The heart may not originate our feelings, but it is highly responsive to them, he says."
"There is a heart disorder first recognized about two decades ago called takotsubo cardiomyopathy The heart weakens in response to intense stress or grief, such as after a romantic breakup or the death of a loved one. In the acute period, it can cause heart failure, lifethreatening arrhythmias."
"The word emotion stems in part from the French verb mouvoir, meaning to stir up Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been linked to many stressful situations, including public speaking. It's even been associated with widespread social upheaval, such as after a natural disaster."
"Heart specialist: Broken hearts are literally and figuratively deadly. Emotions, you will learn, can and do have a direct physical effect on the human heart. The care of the heart has become less the province of philosophers, who dwell upon the heart's metaphorical meanings, and more the domain of doctors."
"The emotional heart intersects with its biological counterpart in surprising and mysterious ways. The symbolism of the emotional heart endures even today. If we ask people which image they most associate with love, there's no question that the Valentine heart would be the top of the list."
"The American Heart Association still does not list emotional stress as a key risk factor for heart disease. The heart shape, called a cardioid, is common in nature. It's found in the leaves, flowers and seeds of many plants, including silphium."
"Political cartoonist has been a political cartoonist on the global stage for the last 20 years. He has seen dictators fall, we saw others hang on. And then there is the timeless Kim dynasty of North Korea. These guys seem to be coming straight out of Cartoon Network."
"The North Korean leader's son has proved himself a worthy successor to the throne. Mark Zuckerberg is the kings and the emperors of our time, says the cartoonist. In the 1830s, postrevolutionary France under King Louis Philippe, journalists and caricaturists fought for the freedom of the press."
"Cartoonists from Venezuela, Russia, Syria have been forced into exile. They were jailed, they were fined, but they prevailed. Today, 200 years after Daumier, are political cartoons at risk of disappearing? Musa Kart was sentenced to three years in jail for doing political cartoons."
"Political cartoons were born with democracy, and they are challenged when freedom is challenged. Cartooning for Peace Foundation was founded by Kofi Annan, the late Nobel Peace Laureate. A cartoon by a famous Portuguese cartoonist was picked by an editor at the New York Times and reprinted in international editions."
The New York Times has come under fire for a cartoon showing President Donald Trump following Israel's Prime Minister. The cartoon has been compared to antiSemitic propaganda. The paper has been criticized for its handling of the controversy. The editor of the New York Times says he has issues with the cartoon.
"Social media is both a blessing and a curse for cartoons, says the cartoonist. The real target behind the cartoon is the media that published it, he says. Even quality newspapers mimic the codes of social networks on their websites, he adds. The relationship between traditional media and social media is a funny one."
"We're not going to put up warnings the way we do on cigarette packs, he says. Freedom of expression is not incompatible with intolerance, he adds. Let us not become our own censors in the name of political correctness"
"The book opens at the funeral of the twins halfBritish cousin Sophie after her drowning. The novel forays into the past to explore the characters struggles to operate in a world where they dont quite fit, alongside their nations political turmoil."
"Arundhati Roys 1997 novel The God of Small Things is set in a town in Kerala, India. In the novel, she interrogates the culture of her native India. One of her focuses is the caste system, a way of classifying people by hereditary social class."
About 820 million people in the world don't get enough to eat every day. We need to accelerate our progress in agricultural productivity to feed the nine to 10 billion people who will be alive in 2050. The earth has warmed about one degree centigrade since preindustrial times. Climate change is affecting agricultural productivity.
There's about one billion people who are zinc deficient. Cattle are already being affected because the quality of their forage is declining. B vitamins are critical for a whole range of reasons. They help convert our food into energy. They're important for the functions of many of the physiologic activities in our bodies.
"Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are reducing the nutritional quality of our food. Protein declines about 10 percent, iron about eight percent, zinc about five percent. Vitamin B1 and vitamin B2, there's about a 17 percent decline. Folate is about a 30 percent decline, according to research."
"Researchers estimate that 125 million people could be affected by climate change. They modeled what would be the most effective interventions, and their conclusion was reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. The darker the color in this, the larger the consequences of climate change, he says."
"We need to make sure we get what we need every day so we can grow and thrive. We don't know exactly what those solutions are, but we've got a range of options. It will take time to sort all of these issues out. Let's invest in ourselves, in our children and in our planet."
"Researchers are working on ways to replicate the human brain using computer technology. To scan a brain at a resolution of a thousandth of a millimeter would require fundamentally new scanning technology. The main obstacles to doing so are computing power and storage space, both of which are improving every year."
"The human brain contains 86 billion neurons, connected by at least a hundred trillion synapses. The main challenges are scanning a brain in enough detail to capture the mind and perfectly recreating that detail artificially. Even if we can eventually upload our minds, whether we should remains an open question."
"Today's AI can do a task like identify a pedestrian in a picture, but it doesn't have a concept of what the pedestrian is beyond that it's a collection of lines and textures and things. There are also a lot of influences on neural signaling that are poorly understood or undiscovered."
"The danger of AI is not that it's going to rebel against us, but that it will do exactly what we ask it to do. David Ha: How do we set up the problem so that it actually does what we want? Ha: What kind of mindblowing new flavors could we generate with the power of an advanced artificial intelligence?"
"CNN's John Sutter asked an AI to come up with new paint colors. The AI did what he asked it to, but it didn't know about anything else. Sutter teamed up with coders from Kealing Middle School to find out the answer."
Tesla's selfdriving car failed to brake when a truck drove out in front of it. Amazon's rsumsorting algorithm learned to discriminate against women. An AI that was trained on example rsums learned to avoid people who went to women's colleges.
"The problem with AI is that it doesn't know what it's doing, says Andrew Keen. Keen: We have to be prepared to work with an AI that's not the supercompetent, allknowing AI of science fiction"
"A Finnish smith forged the Sampo for a woman who promised him the hand of her daughter. When the woman refused to marry him, the smith had to return home alone. He and a bard set out on a quest to retrieve the artifact by force."
"Lemminkinen and his friends set out on a journey to find the legendary 'Sampo' The 'Sappo' is said to have been made from the tips of whiteswan feathers, a single grain of barley, and the finest wool of lambskins"
"Mangroves are home to jackals, turtles, shorebirds and otters. They can store upwards of five to ten times more carbon dioxide than tropical forests. Mangroves also prevent soil erosion and can be the first line of defense between storm surges, tsunamis."
"Fishing cats are one of about 40 species of wildcats. They're probably around twice the size of our average domestic cat. In Indonesia, people call them kucing bakau, which literally translates to the cat of the mangroves"
"Fishing cats are threatened by habitat loss, mainly because of demand for farmed fish and shrimp. The deforestation of nearly half the historic mangrove cover in South and Southeast Asia is also a problem. Some fishing cats experience spontaneous desire, that just sort of seems to appear out of the blue."
"Couples who have a strong sexual connection have strong trust, says therapist Sue Johnson. They choose to set aside all the other things that they could be doing, she says. Stop doing all that stuff and create a protected space where all you're going to do is put your body in the bed"
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a group of young men about their relationship with women. He says the men are struggling to find a way to connect with each other. Sutter: It's not that they don't want to, it's that they can't"
"Emily Stengel: I was thinking about sex all day, every day, and I was so stressed by the project that I had zero  zero!  interest in actually having any sex She spent months traveling all over, talking with anyone who would listen about the science of women's sexual wellbeing. By the time I got home, you know, I'd show up for the party, put my body in the bed, let my skin touch my partner"
"We decided to do what it took to find our way back to each other, says author. There's nothing more important than having a good relationship with your partner, she says. It's not about having sex, it's about having a relationship with each other"
"A single parrotfish can produce over 380 kilograms of this pulverized coral each year. They have multiple wardrobe changes throughout their life, including a sex change from female to male. And sometimes they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head that envelops their entire body."
"Parrotfish are being targeted by fishermen in Belize, Barbuda and Bonaire. Spearfishing took out the large species, and nets and traps are scooping up the smaller species. Because of climate change, on top of overfishing and pollution, coral reefs may be gone within 30 years."
"We're in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. And we, humans, are causing it. We also have the solutions. Reverse climate change and overfishing, protect half the ocean and stop pollution running from land. But these are massive undertakings requiring systemic changes."
"Parrotfish can grow well over a meter long and weigh over 20 kilograms. They have a mouth like a parrot's beak, which is strong enough to bite coral, although mostly they're after algae. Their fossils are often preserved as layered rock structures, called stromatolites."
"In 1871, Charles Darwin suggested: What if life started in some warm little pond with all sort of chemicals still ready to undergo more complex changes? 100 years after Darwin's letter, deepsea hydrothermal vents, or hot vents, were discovered in the ocean. These are also chemical factories."
"Darwin's warm little pond is a reasonable originoflife candidate. Earth is the only planet in our solar system known to have sparked life, and the only system able to provide life support for human beings. At about 2.5 billion years ago, there is evidence that bacteria had begun to produce oxygen."
Life on Earth is the product of four or so billion years of coevolution. Earth is unique for having liquid water on its surface and an oxygenrich atmosphere. Local people should be at the forefront of the solutions to the challenges facing their wildlife.
Zimbabwe's first lion conservationist was 25 years old. He was mesmerized by the beauty and the tranquility of African wild dogs. He decided to dedicate his life to protecting animals. He says local communities must protect and coexist with wildlife or conservation efforts will fail.
"Cecil the lion was killed on July 2, 2015. He was one of the last lions to die in the wild in Zimbabwe. Cecil's death sparked a debate about the role of lions in conservation. He said: We need to make sure that we don't lose the lions that we love"
High inflation that isnt accompanied by high demand can lead to a recession. Interest rates reflect the cost of taking on debt for individuals and companies. Some economists believe that business activity from a markets expansion can occasionally reach an unsustainable level.
"A recession can be a mild decline in economic activity that lasts months or a longlasting downturn with global ramifications that last years. The Bronze recession in Britain eventually ended when the adoption of iron helped revolutionize farming and food production. Modern markets are more complex, making todays recessions far  more difficult to navigate."
There are 2.6 billion people in the world. That's a billion more than the population of the United States. That means there's a huge potential for growth in the number of people playing video games. But it also means that the amount of money made is decreasing.
"Gaming is already a medium like literature or anything else that's becoming a fundamental part of our lives. People earning incomes modding games, building content in them, doing art in them. There's something at a scale akin to the Florentine Renaissance, happening on your kid's iPhone in your living room."
"Behind the scenes in games, we've had a limit for a very long time. The World of Warcraft is actually thousands of smaller worlds. When you hear about concerts in Fortnite, you're actually hearing about thousands of small concerts. There isn't really this possibility to bring it all together."
"The technology is in place to go well beyond the limits that we've previously seen. I'm talking about not individual little simulations but a massive possibility of huge networks of interaction. This is a game being built by one of the biggest companies in the world, NetEase."
"Computer scientists have created an entire planet that can be played on multiple devices. Even the weather is simulated. This is the sort of astounding set of experiences, well beyond what we might have imagined, that are now going to be possible. The last time any of us had the opportunity to build or do something together with that may people was in antiquity."
"We all are, inside, multiple people. We rarely get the opportunity to flex that. It's also about empathy. I have a friend who I love to bits, but every story I have is like 50 years later We all want to be different, but we can be the same person It's about empathy"
"I think games could really start to create an opportunity for us to empathize again There's a reality you have to accept, and that is that the impact of what I'm talking about will be profound I'm struck by how social media has amplified our many differences, and really made us more who we are"
"There are still huge technological frontiers that need to be overcome here, akin to those we faced when building the early internet, he says. Let's actually try to make this something that we shape in a positive way, rather than once again have be done to us, he adds."
"French attempts to reinstate slavery met fierce resistance, with General Christophe even burning the capital city to prevent military occupation. In 1804, Dessalines was proclaimed  the emperor of independent Haiti. But his desire to hold exclusive power alienated his supporters. The subsequent power struggle led to a Civil War, which split the country in two."
Christophe was born in Grenada and fought in the Battle of Savannah in 1779. He was crowned king of Haiti in 1811. He instituted mandatory labor and imported European artists and teachers. His reign ended in 1820 when his military defected to southern forces. He committed suicide.
"Its made up of cells called chondrocytes, and youll need a healthy supply of them for your bioink. These cells can come from donors whose cell are replicated in a lab. Or they might originate from a  patient's own tissue to create a personalized meniscus less likely to be rejected by their body."
"Bioprinting is a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. The technology opens up a dizzying array of possibilities, such as printing tissues with embedded electronics. Theres tremendous potential to use bioprinting to save lives and advance our understanding of how our organs function."
"In 2003, when we sequenced the human genome, we thought we would have the answer to treat many diseases. Then I realized why no one has done this before: it's extremely difficult. There are many metabolites in our body. Each one is different from the other one."
"There are over 100,000 metabolites in our body. Metabolites are any molecule that is supersmall in their size. We are able to infer what each metabolite mass is, like that 180 could be glucose here, and, more importantly, to discover how changes in glucose and other metabolites lead to a disease."
"Metabolites are involved in our metabolism. They are also downstream of DNA, so they carry information from both our genes as well as lifestyle. Understanding metabolites is essential to find treatments for many diseases. I'm thrilled to be talking to you by this hightech method."
"When ancient people tried to explain their condition, they typically did so in grandiose cosmic terms. Even though their actual explanations, their myths, were largely false. Twentiethcentury physics did create better explanations, but still in terms of a cosmic war. This time, the combatants were order and chaos, or entropy."
"In the beginning of the universe, novelty vanished from the universe. There's never been any new kind of astronomical object. So long as the great monotony lasts, what has been out there really is what will be. In other words, humans are not playthings of cosmic forces."
"The origin of life was the first genetic knowledge, coding for biological adaptations. Evolution created billions of different chemicals on Earth. Explanatory knowledge is the defining adaptation of our species. The Earth will become the only known object in the universe that turns aside incoming asteroids instead of attracting them."
"The universe at large is relatively simple. Big, massive, powerful things strongly affect lesser things, and not vice versa. The hierarchy rule is not a law of nature. It just happens to have held so far in the universe, except here. In our biosphere, moleculesized objects, genes, control vastly disproportionate resources."
"Explanatory knowledge is potentially far more powerful because of universality, and more rapidly created. When human knowledge has achieved a factor 10 to the 40, it will pretty much control the entire galaxy. The only alternative to static societies is continual creation of new ideas, behaviors, new kinds of objects."
"The 1901 Buffalo World's Fair featured minstrel shows. The exhibit was curated by African American scholar W.E.B. Du Bois. The show pitted the black Northerner against the Southerner, and the African American against the African."
At Buffalo is a musical based on the story of the Black Power movement in the U.S. The musical is based on a speech given by Mary Talbert to the local black community. We've got something to show  we're going to teach a lesson
"At Buffalo is a new musical based on the 1901 PanAmerican Exposition. The first World's Fair of the 20th century, held in Buffalo, New York. Using collections from over 30 archival institutions, the musical performs the massive archive."
"The potato was too efficient for Europe's good. A blight from South America affected one potato, and two million people died. Even the king and queen of France were forced to wear potato flowers. The potato was a miracle, but it was also a disaster."
The obsession with efficiency can actually make us less efficient. The problems of efficiency today are less drastic but more chronic. Hospitals have hundreds of devices registering alarms. Algorithms can learn a lot  fast. But they can tell us only about the past.
"The cloud is giving us more for less, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: It can be wasteful to try to avoid all waste. He says technology that was designed to shorten the war, prolonged it. The biggest cost of all may be missed opportunities, Sutter says."
"It took over 20 years for the patent on the principle of dry photocopying, by Chester Carlson in 1938, to result in the Xerox 914 copier introduced in 1959. Lithiumion batteries in portable devices and electric cars are based on a 30yearold principle. Data and measurement are essential, but not enough."
"A third of the world's buttons were produced in Muscatine, 1.5 billion a year. The last plants have closed now, but there is still a museum of the pearl button industry. The house where China's future president stayed in 1986 is now the SinoUS Friendship House."
"Medical research has shown that actually fidgeting, getting up, walking around is one of the best things you can do for your heart. Great forms can be created by imaginative development of accidents. It can be more efficient to be less fluent."
"Software can tell what has made people in an organization succeed in the past. Software, screening software, has no way to tell, who is going to be useful in the future. We need multiple independent systems. If one fails, then the others can override it."
"King Frederick the Great of Prussia was the first enthusiast. Irving Thalberg, a former secretary with intuitive genius, achieved rational extravagance. Too much efficiency can weaken itself. But a bit of inspired inefficiency can strengthen it. Sometimes, the best way to move forward is to follow a circle."
"Talos was created by Hephaestus, a Greek god, to defend his island kingdom of Crete. The Argonauts were captured by Prussian soldiers, but Talos spotted them. Medea offered to make Talos immortal in exchange for removing a bolt on his ankle."
"Hephaestus, god of technology, was hard at work on his most ingenious invention yet. The god named his creation Talos:  the first robot. Three times a day, the bronze guardian  marched around the island's perimeter searching for interlopers."
"The evolution of nails and the evolution  of opposable thumbs and toes are closely linked. Claws are ideal for piercing,  puncturing, and hooking, but their points make grabbing difficult,  and potentially dangerous. Animals with nails, on the other hand, have much broader digits, and keratinocytes only cover the top  surface of their wide bones."
"Nails first appeared in the fossil record around 55.8 million years ago. Claws had already been present for over 260 million years in the ancestors of mammals and reptiles. Both nails and claws are made of keratin, a tough, fibrous protein also found in horns, scales, hooves and hair."
"An architect from Beijing, China, has designed a new fish tank for fish. The cubic space wasn't the perfect home for them, so he decided to design a new tank for them. I think they should feel happier living in this space, but I wouldn't know because they don't talk"
"Marilyn Monroes is a Chinese architect. Her latest project is a highrise residential tower in Beijing. She says she wanted to combine nature and man in a new way. In the modern city, we often think architecture is a machine, is a box"
"I like the randomness in the hand sketch. And they can carry sort of emotions that cannot be made by computers, he says. I think it's a very good way to show the relationship between humans and nature, he adds. It's a beautiful thing to see the human side of nature"
"The building is on the edge of a beautiful park. It's different from the surrounding buildings, because other buildings are trying to build a wall around the nature. But what we're trying to do here is to make the building itself as a part of nature, so we can extend the nature from the park into the city."
"In China, people can walk on the roof of a building that looks like a cloud. The building is part of an opera house in the northern city of Tianjin. The other building is a museum being built in the city of Los Angeles."
"The museum will be completed in the year 2022, and you're all invited when it's completed. By lifting this museum, making it float above the ground, we can free up a lot of landscape and space underneath the building. And then we can, at the same time, create a roof garden above the building where you can visit and enjoy the view."
"In 1784, there were over 600 members, including influential scholars and politicians. Many in the government and church believed that both groups were determined to undermine the peoples religious faith. But these groups didnt necessarily  oppose religion they just believed it should be kept  separate from governance."
"Adam Weishaupt founded a secret society in Bavaria in 1776 to spread his secular philosophy. He modelled his society off the Freemasons, an elite masonry group. The group was banned in 1784 by a Bavarian government decree. The idea of a secret group orchestrating political upheaval is still alive and well."
"The Illuminati is a secret society that was formed in Bavaria in the early 1900s. It was formed by members of the Roman Catholic Church who wanted to fight for human rights. The group was later joined by a number of other groups, including the Freemasons."
"The magic of levitation, 100 years ago, would have been impossible. Today, technology makes anything possible. But still, our imagination is more powerful than our reasoning, and it's easy to attribute personality to machines. Magicians are interesting because their illusions accomplish what technology cannot."
"Osteoarthritis causes chronic inflammation that destroys bone and cartilage. As the enzymes eat away at cartilage, the body attempts to stabilize smaller joints by fusing them together. This process sometimes leads to  outgrowths called bone spurs, which also cause intense stiffness and joint pain."
"Arthritis is actually a spectrum of over 100 different arthritic conditions. Even the most common type, osteoarthritis, is trickier to prevent than one might think. The Notion of Family was created out of our struggle to survive environmental racism and healthcare inequity."
"Shea and Amber cofounded artist collective The Sister Tour, whose mission is to provide a safe space for Flint artists. Nestle pumps 400 gallons of water per minute out of aquifers in Lake Michigan, nearly free of charge. The company also extracts millions of liters of water from First Nation reservations."
"Moses West invented a 26,000pound atmospheric water generator in Puerto Rico. He brought it to Flint, Michigan, where it's being used to provide clean water. It's been five years, and we're still waiting on justice, West says."
"Residents in Flint, Michigan, can buy water from a machine that creates 2,000 gallons a day. The machine is operated by a woman and her eightyearold daughter. It's a miracle that God gave Moses the knowledge and technology to provide us with pure drinking water, the woman says."
"I was overcome with a deep sense of joy and righteousness, says the photographer. No matter how dark a situation may be, a camera can extract the light and turn a negative into a positive I started life as a fashion designer, working closely with textile designers and fabric suppliers"
"Inventors are using mycelium, the root system of fungi, to bind together agricultural byproducts. Fungi are able to grow materials that are naturally fire retardant, without any chemicals. They're naturally hydrophobic, meaning they won't absorb water. In other words, we can grow all kinds of structures using living organisms."
"Mushrooms can be turned into bricks in as little as 30 days. The process is similar to that used to turn sand into cement. The difference is that the bricks are made from living organisms, rather than plastic. The result is a much more sustainable and environmentally friendly product."
"Biofabricated bricks are nearly three times stronger than a concrete block. They store more carbon than they make. If we could replace the 1.2 trillion fired bricks that are made each year, we could reduce CO2 emissions by 800 million tons every year."
"We're thinking about the new factories as being living cells We need a material revolution, and we need it now I'm committed to making this future a reality It's time for a new generation of innovators"
"Odins great hall of Valhalla towered above the mountains and Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, anchored itself. The gods sealed the deal with solemn oaths and swore the mason would come  to no harm in Asgard. The wall stood high and impenetrable with only the gate left to be built."
"Loki, the trickster Loki, concocted a devious plan to gain the favor of the gods. He would build them the greatest wall theyd ever seen, higher than any giant could climb and stronger than any troll could break. All he asked in return was the beautiful  goddess Freyas hand in marriage."
"Odin told the gods they should accept the strangers offer, but set such strict conditions that he would fail to complete the wall in time. That way, they would lose nothing, while  getting most of the wall built for free. Freya didnt like this idea at all, but Odin and the other gods were convinced and came to an agreement. He would only have one winter  to finish the wall. If any part was unfinished by the first day"
LASIK is a technique that uses a laser to sculpt the cornea into the correct shape. The process usually takes less than 30 seconds for each eye. Some patients experience slightly blurred vision that cant be corrected by glasses. But the technique is currently as likely to damage your eyes as wearing daily disposable contact lenses for one year.
"In 1948, Spanish ophthalmologist Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner was fed up with glasses. Using a miniature lathe, he ground the  frozen cornea into the precise shape necessary to focus the patients vision. Then he thawed the disc, and sewed it back on."
"Creating a new drug is a lot like crafting a key to fit a particular lock. We need to get the shape just right. If we change the shape of a constrained peptide by too much, those extra chemical bonds are unable to form and the whole molecule falls apart."
"There are only a few constrained peptide drugs available today, but there are a lot that will hit the market in the coming decade. Constrained peptides are very small proteins. They've got extra chemical bonds that constrain the shape of the molecule. This makes them incredibly stable as well as highly potent."
"Drugs that are made of protein are called biologic drugs. These include medicines like insulin or antibody drugs like Humira or Enbrel. People accepted acceleration as inevitable, both the thrills and the lack of control. But even people who are winning at the speed game admit to feeling a little uneasy."
"Speed is paradoxical, and like all good paradoxes, it teaches us about the human experience, as absurd and complex as it is. The first paradox is that we love speed, and we're thrilled by its intensity. We invent roller coasters and race cars and supersonic planes, but we get whiplash, carsick, jetlagged."
"Having more information at our fingertips was supposed to make decisionmaking easier. German speakers even have a word for this: Eilkrankheit In English, that's hurry sickness When we have to make fast decisions, autopilot brain kicks in."
"We think that if we just speed up enough, we can outrun our problems, but we never do. We're turning to artificial intelligence to help us make faster and smarter decisions. But machines crunching data are no substitute for critical and sustained thinking by humans."
"Anthropologist: Slow time is not wasted time. Culture and rituals around the world build in slowness. Slowness helps us reinforce our shared values and connect. We need to master speed, and that means thinking carefully about the tradeoffs of any given technology."
"Marijuana contains two main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC,  and cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible for marijuanas psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception. CBD is responsible for the nonpsychoactive effects."
"Marijuana can disrupt the development of white matter tracts, and also affect the brains ability to grow new connections. The white matter is involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Marijuanainduced psychosis is also more common among young adults."
"Marijuana acts on the bodys cannabinoid system, which has receptors all over the body. When a message passes from one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron releases endocannabinoids. In the 12th century, the tower of Pisa was at risk of falling."
"chemotherapy affects other healthy cells in the body that naturally have to renew rapidly. Hair follicles, the cells of the mouth, the gastrointestinal lining, the reproductive system, and bone marrow are hit nearly as hard as cancer. The rapid production of these normal cells means that theyre reaching for resources more frequently and are therefore more exposed to chemo drugs."
"In 2018 alone, over 17 million people  worldwide received a cancer diagnosis. Scientists tried desperately to develop an antidote to this vicious weapon of war. Chemotherapy drugs are delivered through pills and injections and use cytotoxic agents"
"I closed the door to my office every night, but the door in my head remained wideopen and the stress just flooded in We don't really experience much of it at work. We're too busy. We experience it outside of work, when we are commuting and when we're trying to rejuvenate"
"The more we ruminate about work when we're home, the more likely we are to experience sleep disturbances and to eat unhealthier foods. It may even increase our risk of cardiovascular disease and of impairing our executive functioning, the very skill sets we need to do our jobs well."
"Anxiously worrying about the future feels compelling. Ruminating always feels like we're doing something important. But we all do it far more than we realize. Back when I was burned out, I decided to keep a journal for a week and document how much time I spent ruminating."
"CNN.com's John Sutter talks about how to change your habits. Sutter: I could have worked at McDonald's and made more money than I ever made before He made a rule that he was done at 8pm every night and stuck to it. You have to define when you switch off every night, he says."
The number of people telecommuting has increased 115 percent over the past decade. This means that reminders of work will be able to trigger ruminations from anywhere in our home. We have to trick our mind into defining work and nonwork times and spaces.
"CNN.com's John Sutter talks about the importance of setting aside time for yourself. He says it's important to take breaks from your work when you need them. Sutter: When you're not doing anything, you're thinking about something else"
"Ruminations often deny us our most precious moments. To convert a ruminative thought into a productive one, you have to pose it as a problem to be solved. Banishing ruminations truly enhanced my personal life, but what it enhanced even more was the joy and satisfaction I get from my work."
"With increasing animal production, also antibiotic use skyrocketed worldwide. Unfortunately, so did antibiotic resistance. If you want to reduce your stress and improve your quality of life, you don't necessarily have to change your hours or your job. You just need to change how you think."
"The levels of antibioticresistant salmonella in pigs in Europe range from less than a percent to as high [as] 60 percent. Pets rank even amongst the heaviest users of all, and they use antibiotics that are much more critical for human health."
More than 100 people got infected with a multidrugresistant salmonella after feeding pig ears to their dog. The EU was the first region to ban putting antibiotics in low doses in the feed. Antibiotics were only allowed when a veterinarian determined the animal was sick.
"The UN predicts that by 2050, antimicrobial resistance will become our single biggest killer. Feeding a wellbalanced diet is important for the health of the animals, says Dr. John MoyaSmith. Like being yourself on a diet of hamburger buns, rice, waffles and protein bars"
There are about eight times more microorganisms in your gut than there are in your body. This is why we need to make our gut healthier. We need to reduce the amount of bacteria in our gut. We also need to improve the quality of our food. We can do this by making our food healthier.
"Around 50 to 80 percent of all antibiotics are used by animals. The threepronged nutribiosis approach involving the host, nutrition and the microbiome is the way to do it. But to make this happen, we have to set reduction targets and make sure they're followed all around the world."
"The first largescale use of antibiotics was in the early '50s of the last century. When animals were sick, you could now treat them with antibiotics so they did not die. But soon, it was discovered that adding small and regular amounts of antibiotics to the feed kept the animals healthy."
"Bacteria can be made to behave in very specific ways with the help of biological circuits. These program different behaviors depending on the presence, absence, or combination of certain factors. Synthetic biologists can program bacteria to sense those conditions, and by doing so, respond to tumors while avoiding healthy tissue."
"Bacteria can be reprogrammed to carry cancerfighting drugs. Bacteria have the unique advantage of being able to selectively grow inside tumors. Bacterium can be programmed to target specific areas of the body. The technology is still in its early stages, but could be used to treat cancer."
"In 2004, I started conducting my own clown rounds at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Randomized controlled trials in Israel and Italy show that medical clowns can be as effective as tranquilizers with no side effects. We're often the one element that a child could control while they're in the hospital."
CNN's John Defterios visits the hospital bedsides of terminally ill children. He says the staff and the parents work together to bring joy to the children. Defterio: We're not there merely to distract or make anyone feel better per se
"The University of Haifa offers a formal undergraduate degree program in medical clowning. Argentina has passed laws requiring the presence of medical clowns in public hospitals at their largest province. In 2018, at the Healthcare Clowning International Meeting, they represented over 150 programs in 50 different countries."
"Bella is 83 and lives with dementia. She says medical clowning is an excellent way of using the arts to put the care back in health care. Research conducted in Brazil, Australia, Canada and Germany confirm that the artistic interventions of medical clowns improve the work environment."
"Kelsey Leonard Nooweesuonk is a medical clown. His tools are whoopee cushions, shakers (Shaker rattles) and a red nose. I feel like we are already in that time of prophecy, he says."
"CNN's John Sutter asks: What do you think about water? Sutter says the answer is, It's life He says we need to think of water as a source of life, not as a commodity. Sutter: We need to make water a part of our daily lives."
Shinnecock: The Western legal system's failure to recognize the legal personhood of water is a problem. She asks: Who is justice for? Humanity alone? The Supreme Court found in Citizens United that a corporation was a person with similar protections under the Constitution.
"Indigenous legal systems have a foundational principle of understanding our nonhuman relations as being living and protected under our laws. It grants water the right to exist, flourish, and naturally evolve. It protects the water from human beings that would do it harm. It reverses the accepted hierarchy of humanity's domination over nature."
"We need laws that protect the rights of people to water. We need laws to protect the water rights of the people of the world. And we need to protect water rights for all people, not just a few. We must protect our water rights, and we must protect the right to water for all."
"Water is the first medicine that each of us as human beings is exposed to. We nurture water in our wombs for nine months. We are all born with a natal connection to water. But somewhere along the way, we lost that connection, and we have to work to restore it."
"I am holding it higher than ever, boldly, brilliantly, inviting you to join me in its dangerous light, she says. We need to be in those rooms, showing up for one another, challenging the cultural construct that encourages us, especially women and girls, to compete, compare, criticize, she adds."
"Women on the dangerous side of 60 are not retiring. They are rewiring  taking all that they know and have done and redefining what age looks like, can do. At each end of the age spectrum, women are taking the risk to create change."
LZ Granderson is a journalist and author. He was one of the first women to work in television news. Granderson: I'm not a woman who wants to be a woman. I want to do my job. He says women should not have to work harder for the same pay as men.
"At 77, Hillary Clinton says she has nothing left to prove, less to lose Clinton: I acknowledge my privilege in being able to do that, to speak my truth I don't think we're waiting to be empowered. I think we have power, she says."
"LZ Granderson: We are living in dangerous times. LZ: It's time to play the women's card, play the race card. He says women can be our sources of renewable power for each other. Lz: Let's change the nature of power by dismantling some of the barriers that remain."
"CNN's John Defterios says he wants to see more women in leadership roles. He says women need to take control of their own destinies. We need to be able to say, 'I am a woman, and I want to be a leader'"
"Ancient peoples made alcohol from whatever crops and plants grew where they lived. In South America, people made chicha from grains, sometimes adding hallucinogenic herbs. In whats now Mexico, pulque, made from cactus sap, was the drink of choice. East Africans made banana and palm beer."
"For thousands of years, alcohol content was limited. 9th century Arabic writings describe boiling fermented liquids to vaporize the alcohol in them. Alcohol boils at a lower temperature than water, so it vaporizes first. Rum made from sugar harvested in European colonies became a staple for sailors."
"Nobody knows exactly when humans began to create fermented beverages. The earliest known evidence comes from 7,000 BCE in China. Mesopotamians and Egyptians made beer throughout the year from stored cereal grains. Workers even received it in their daily rations."
"The Russian monarchy was on the brink of collapse, and to Yusupov and his fellow aristocrats, the holy man theyd invited to dinner was the single cause. They were convinced the only way to maintain order was to eliminate this sham of a holy man."
"Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin was born in Siberia in 1869. He converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in the 1890s. Inspired by the humbled monks that wandered endlessly from holy site to holy site, he spent years on pilgrimages across Russia."
"The Pacific Ocean is home to an incredibly productive ecosystem. Toxic blooms of phytoplankton can contaminate food webs and accumulate in shellfish and fish. The problem is the ocean's a moving target and, much like some people in our lives, toxicity varies among the plankton."
"The Pacific Ocean is our largest, deepest ocean basin. It covers 60 million square miles. 2014 was probably one of the worst harmful algal blooms in Oregon history. The five hottest years in the modern climate record have been the last five."
"The Pacific Ocean is four times the size of the Amazon rain forest. It's a massive ecosystem, from the blues of the open ocean to the green of the continental margins. It is warm, in a good way, it's absolutely the type of place you want to dive in and swim."
Oceans absorb about 90 percent of the heat that's generated by greenhouse gas emissions. The rate of carbon dioxide increase in our atmosphere is unprecedented for our planet. And that has consequences for our oceans. The Keeling Curve has documented the rapid increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
"Scientists have been measuring CO2 levels in the ocean for 30 years. They have found a 30 percent decline in pH in the top of the water column. The change in pH affects organisms that need to grow and reproduce. It also affects ecosystems as large as coral reefs, the scientists say."
"These organisms are small, abundant, ancient, and they are critical to sustaining our population and our planet These microbial ecosystems are changing in real and measurable ways, and it is not that hard to see it We are bearing witness to the changes that are being inflicted upon our natural communities, and by doing so, it provides us the opportunity to adapt"
"In south Louisiana, those who can afford to do so are already moving. Communities that had been here for thousands of years were suffering the same fate. Erasure is what communities around the globe are fighting as we get real about the impacts of climate change."
"Climate change is a much larger conversation than reducing CO2 emissions, says Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: We must start preparing for global migration today. It's a reality now. Our cities and our communities are not prepared Climate change will cause rounds of climate gentrification, he says."
"Climate change is the most horrible symptom of an economic system that has been built for a few to extract every precious value out of this planet and its people. The social, political and economic systems of extraction must be transformed into systems that regenerate the earth and advance human liberty globally."
"Climate change is a threat to our individual privilege, says U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise. Scalise: We must establish a new social attitude to see migration as a benefit, a necessity for our global survival We can invest more of our time in justice, but it cannot be for temporary gain, Scalise says."
"CNN's John Sutter: We must transform from a disposable, individual society into one that sees our collective, longterm humanity We can do this, because we must. We must, or else we lose our planet and we lose ourselves, Sutter says."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the impact of habitat fragments in the U.S. Sutter: It's a really vital and interconnected system, and some people could see how they were a part of it Habitat fragments provide food and homes to thousands of amazing species of animals, he says."
"The world's largest network of radio transmitters is based in New York City. It's the world's biggest radio network, with more than 100 million subscribers. The network is designed to transmit data back to the rest of the world in realtime."
"The Bronx's first and only science museum is called MICRO. The museum draws people in so that they can explore and learn together in a social way. One by one, together, we're filling gaps, strengthening the systems that we're all a part of, she says."
"If you've been feeling overwhelmed or powerless lately, then I'm asking you to please try this very small strategy on for size, and let's see how it goes. Step one: zoom in. Step two: look for the resource gaps, because that's where you can make the biggest difference. Step three: find the other habitat fragments. Find out how they can support you and how you can support them. Step four: transform your fragment."
"Venezuelanborn cartoonist says he wanted to do something about climate change. He was fired from his job at a Venezuelan newspaper over a cartoon about the country's health care system. I started to feel a little differently as my perspective shifted from the macro towards the micro, he says."
"Venezuelan cartoonist says he was forced out of his home country. He says dictators hate cartoonists and try to eradicate humor as a mirror for social and political issues. A good cartoon conveys a plot of a fulllength movie in a single frame, he says."
"Cartoons are drawn from observation and analysis. They are inspired by muses of mythology, as well as classical, modern and paleolithic tales. When we are told that a modernday emperor is wearing new clothes, cartoons reveal that the emperor just might still be naked."
"Cartoonist says he was happy Chavez died because it would bring Venezuela closer to freedom. He says a cartoon is born from a space of deep, nuanced thinking. A lack of freedom stimulates creativity and empowers it, he says."
"I felt stuck, I couldn't allow my happiness to seep into my work, says the cartoonist. A good cartoon has a lot of power. It can generate action and reaction In some countries, having an opinion has a cost, and in some countries that cost is high"
"Venezuelanborn cartoonist draws images of political prisoners in prison. I don't want them to be forgotten by the community. There are men and women who are stuck behind bars as political prisoners I drew my own world, my fears, my suitcase, my roots and everything that I had to leave behind in Venezuela"
"I, Immigrant has traveled to multiple cities, including Miami, Houston, Madrid and Barcelona. The show has become a meeting space for the diaspora, for people to gather and recognize their shared experiences of suffering that come with immigration. For me, drawing cartoons is a form of resistance."
"I'm here to honor the sacredness of life that I see at the border, she says. A cartoon is like a Rosetta stone. If we throw it into outer space, a future alien would be able to know that in the past, we once had a civilized world"
"Sister: I was amazed at what I was seeing. There were hundreds of volunteers helping so many families We have all come together in an effort to help 150,000 or more immigrants Just love and compassion was seen everywhere, she says."
"We must always see God's children as equal, she says. It is then that we are present to them and we can make their humanity a part of our own humanity I am 100 percent in favor of what you do, she adds."
"I think what doesn't make it possible is fear  that we're afraid. Immigrant families are like our families, like our neighbors. They're good people who are entering our country and coming to the U.S. only because they're fleeing away from violence."
"I see children who have been separated from their parents for months. I see men and women who drop to their knees, praying. And they were saying to me, (Spanish) Scame de aqu. Because what I see at the border are families, men, who will try to comfort that child."
"It was so beautiful, that was truly a beautiful human encounter, she says. It is what we all are called to do. We just need to allow ourselves to get close enough to see, and we will care, she adds."
"The world has come a long way on getting deworming medicines to the people who need them, and African governments want to gain more traction. The END Fund will work with governments to create a plan that drastically reduces the burden of disease caused by worms. Theyll work together to ensure prevention and treatment programs can serve everyone."
"The END Fund aims to improve health and wellbeing of people in Africa. The fund is funded by donations from the public, as well as donations from businesses and individuals. It is also funded by the World Health Organization and the European Commission. The end goal of the fund is to improve the health of people across Africa."
"There are 1.7 billion people in the world still at risk for worms. For every dollar invested in worm control and prevention, African countries see up to 42 dollars return in economic benefits. One to three pills given once or twice a year is enough to take a child from 200 worms to zero and to protect them from infection going forward."
Just a small population of blood stem cells can regenerate a whole bodys worth of healthy marrow. A bone marrow transplant can also lead to something called graftversustumor activity. New immune cells generated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient's original immune system couldnt.
"Many patients who need a bone marrow transplant dont have a matched family member. Marrow contains fat and other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements are blood stem cells. Because these genes are inherited,  the best matches are often siblings."
"Unlike bees, wasps can sting as many times as they need to. Each worker only lives for roughly 3 weeks, the queens continuous egglaying swells their ranks. In just one summer, the nest reaches the size of a basketball, supporting thousands of workers."
"Wasps are at the top of the local invertebrate food chain, keeping spiders, mites,  and centipedes, in check. With summer over, the usual sources run dry, and the foraging wasps start taking more aggressive risks."
"The Earth was infected with life billions of years ago, when new bacteria learned how to eat sunshine, producing oxygen and pulling in carbon from the air. Some bacteria consumed other bacteria, gaining their power to turn oxygen into energy, becoming the precursors of animals and plants. The queen lays a fertilized egg into each cell, producing as many as 12 in 20 minutes."
"The Cambrian explosion took place seven hundred, eight hundred million years ago. Microbes banded together, creating multicellular life. Jawless fishes invaded the ocean, sporting points, prongs, and finally, fins. Spiders, scorpions, snails and worms came onto land."
"Sharks with buzz saw jaws. Bony fishes that looked like modern angelfish and eels for the first time. Wetlands sporting tenfootlong millipedes and giant dragon flies. The relevance of this, beyond clickbait, coloring books and monster movies is unknown."
"Mammals climbed trees, flew and did a lot of other things that are seemingly sort of modern. They were feeding on the first flowers pollinated by the first bees. There were ecological revolutions on land and at sea, leading to the modern world."
"Paleontology is a thriving science at the intersection of multiple other fields and technologies, he says. We maximize all of it so that we can understand the past and how evolution works, he adds. It involves fundamental questions like Who are we? and What will happen after the next mass extinction?"
"Paleontologists have been studying dinosaurs for more than 4,000 years. They have discovered a number of new species, including the first dinosaurs. They've also discovered new ways of making and eating food. The discovery of the first vertebrae has led to the discovery of a new type of dinosaur."
"Pasta comes from Latin, and it means paste Pasta is definitely gorgeous, but the form also is about how it touches the palate There's no way to trace pasta back to one designer, one inventor"
"In 1967, Alan Frank invented a lid that you could peel a tab off, like in the shape of a guitar pick, and drink it from there. Dry pasta is always durum wheat flour and water. Fresh pasta could be either that or it could be flour and eggs."
"The coffee cup lid is a lid for your coffee cup. It's designed so that you don't splash your face, because it's higher than any of the other ones. And it's got this protruding rim, so it slightly cools the coffee before it hits your lips."
"The first coffee cup lid was invented in 1934. The first chopsticks were used in China in the early 1900s. The chopsticks are still used today, but they are more often used on the go, not in the kitchen, as they were in the past."
"Chopsticks are a pair of two long sticks used to eat things with one hand. Holding chopsticks is a little bit like holding a pencil, except that you have two of them and you move them together in a pincer movement. They're also made out of plastic, bamboo, jade, gold, silver and even ivory."
"Chopsticks are used in a huge portion of the world, across much of Asia, about 1.5 billion people are covered in the chopsticks sphere. Different cultures have slightly different variations of chopsticks. I think you have a much more human relationship to a printed book than you do to one that's on a screen."
"The first books as we know them originated in ancient Rome. Johannes Gutenberg created the means to massproduce a book in the midfifteenth century. Books record the basic human experience like no other medium can. The book itself, you know, can't be turned off with a switch."
"Researchers from the University of Southern California say letting our minds wander is an essential mental state. They say it helps us develop our identity, process social interactions, and it even influences our internal moral compass. Our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling, they say."
"The average U.S. employee only takes half of their allocated paid vacation leave. We need systems that work with our creativity and not against it There is no quick fix for this problem, says the TED Translators admin."
"productivity as we know it today was used during the industrial revolution. Companies struggled to figure out how to tell who was working and who wasn't, so they adopted the old systems. We've been so obsessed with doing more that we've missed the most important thing. The fourpart formula that you can use to say any difficult message well."
"The first part of the feedback formula is what we call the microyes. Great feedback givers begin their feedback by asking a short but important question. The second part is giving your data point. Here, you should name specifically what you saw or heard, and cut out any words that aren't objective."
"Specificity is also important when it comes to positive feedback. Great feedback givers not only can say messages well, but also, they ask for feedback regularly. Pulling feedback establishes you as a continual learner and puts the power in your hands."
A recent Gallup survey found that only 26 percent of employees strongly agree that the feedback they get actually improves their work. Joel Silver: The way that most people give their feedback actually isn't brainfriendly. Silver: People fall into one of two camps. Either they're of the camp that is very indirect and soft.
"I never wanted the stigma or label of what some identified as the stereotypical black father I was ashamed, I was embarrassed, and, at times, he was suicidal, he says. It took a lot of work, time, energy and effort for us to realize that maybe coparenting for us didn't need to mean a shared household and wedding bells"
"In an ideal world, both parents share the weight of the work appropriately. It is beautifully hard work dismantling the systems that would have us believe a woman's primary role is in the kitchen, she says. As equal partners and coparents, it is our duty to ensure that our coparenting partners don't have to put their passions to the back burner"
I want more fathers to embrace coparenting as a model for a better tomorrow I will never fully understand or comprehend what it means to hold a child in my body for 10 months Our role as parents is not dependent on the zeroes at the ends of our checks
"Joel Daniels: Being a father is not only a responsibility, it's an opportunity. Daniels: A more balanced, open, loving approach to parenting was not something we were discussing within our social circles. Coparent wasn't a term I heard or saw where I grew up, where I came from, Daniels says."
"The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in our immune system. Actin is part of a group of proteins known as dynein. Dynein plays a role in the movement of microtubules, which are used to move things around the cell."
Proteins called chromatin remodelers scoot DNA around histones. They allow new pieces of DNA to become exposed. This DNA can then be recognized by other machinery. Scientists are now able to use protein machines to edit genomes.
"Molecular animator creates visualizations of molecules that are so small, they're essentially invisible. These molecules are smaller than the wavelength of light, which means that we can never see them directly. These animations can be incredibly useful for researchers to communicate their ideas of how these molecules work."
"I want you to travel back in time with me, to the before time, to 2017. And then I went to lunch. Ten thousand retweets later, I had accidentally started a project, she said. I was furious. And I didn't want anyone to ever feel that way again"
"People who know each other's passwords are often the ones who give them away. It's like water. It gets in places you don't want it, says security expert. You can't tell your friends what you're up to"
"Use strong, unique passwords for all of your accounts. Turn on the highest level of twofactor authentication that you're comfortable using. Most accounts have a security or privacy tab that tells you what devices are logging in and it tells you where they're logging in from."
"The way stalkerware works is that it's a commercially available program, which an abuser installs on the device that they want to spy on. An abuser can trick their target into installing it themselves by saying, This is a very important program you should install on your device"
"Stalkerware is software that can be installed on a computer without the user's knowledge. The software is designed to prevent victims of domestic violence from reporting their abusers. Stalkerware can be removed by users by running a scan of the computer, but it does not automatically remove the program."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about how to connect with people. Sutter: If you want to connect, then you have to open up He says it's important to ask people about their lives, not just about work. I'm not always that good at it, and I imagine most people aren't"
"Technology has changed the way we communicate, but it hasn't made it easier to connect with other human beings. The secret to connecting in the hightech, fastpaced world that we live in is doing a few small things the oldfashioned way."
Vultures can't see individual carcasses. But the sight of their fellow vultures guides them to the feeding. Their featherless heads help them regulate the sudden rise in temperature as they descend. The carcass is stripped clean in hours before the rotting meat infects the water supply.
"Vultures have the lowest gastric pH in the animal kingdom. Their acidic stomachs protect them from living animals too: their rancid vomit scares off most predators. Vultures are essential to removing pathogens like cholera, anthrax, and rabies."
"conservationists have successfully banned drugs like Diclofenac. Researchers are working to repopulate vulture communities through breeding programs. Some regions have even opened vulture restaurants where farmers safely dispose of drugfree livestock. With help, vultures will be able  to continue their role conserving the health of our planet."
"Two standing stones from the 10th century memorialize different generations of a royal family. The stones announce the power of this Viking Age dynasty. They indicate that Denmark was the earliest major Viking Age kingdom, by telling that Harald controlled southern Norway."
"The Vikings left few monuments. Instead, fragments of stone,  bark, and bone provide the keys to their culture. Many of these objects are inscribed with messages in Old Norse. There was no standard spelling,  they wrote the individual runic letters by pronouncing the sounds of their regional accents."
"Goddess Isis was in hiding from her brother Set, who wanted to kill her. She used her powers to make a poultice to kill the scorpion. The poultices were then used to kill other scorpions that tried to harm her."
"A new drug could prevent four out of ten heart attacks, a relative risk reduction of 40%. Drinking a liter of soda per day doubles your chance of developing cancer. In our group of 1,000 people, four heart attacks would be prevented by taking the drug, but there would be five new cases of cancer."
Risk evaluation is a complicated tangle of statistical thinking and personal preference. Risk is the likelihood that an event will occur. Changes in risk can be expressed  in relative or absolute terms. Understanding how these measures work will help you cut through some of the confusion and better evaluate risk.
"Haircell damage is common: noise exposure, ordinary aging, illness. With a cochlear implant, computer chips do the job for the damaged hair cells. About five percent of the world has significant hearing loss. By 2050, that's expected to double to over 900 million people."
"When cochlear implants first got going, back in the '80s, the operation was Frankensteinmonster scary. By 2001, the procedure had evolved considerably, but it still wiped out any natural hearing that you had. I just wanted to be part of a community like me."
"In silence, I see sound. When I watch a music video without sound, I can hear music. My mind is no longer competing with the distraction of sound. I'm hearing when I need to be, and the rest of the time, I'm not."
"With the cochlear implant, I can stream music from my iPod into my head without earbuds. I once had a travel roommate who had a complete temper tantrum, because I didn't hear her knocking on the door when her key didn't work. I've never seen an episode of Star Trek."
"The Borg assimilated the deaf guy  not out of pity, but because he had a biological distinctiveness. Hitler said that he was inspired by the United States, which had enacted involuntary sterilization laws for the unfit In World War II, an estimated 275,000 people with disabilities were murdered in special death camps."
"Before the implant, he had stopped using the voice telephone and switched to email. Now, when it comes to ignoring voice mail, it no longer matters whether you're deaf or just selfabsorbed. Millennials changed how people think about messaging. They reset the default."
"CNN's John Sutter is on a mission to make technology more accessible. Sutter: It doesn't matter whether I'm deaf or don't want to wake the baby. Both are equally valid Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime no longer say Closedcaptioned for the hearing impaired"
"CNN's John Defterios is a deep space navigator. He says technology can help make the world more human. Our mindset just needs to catch up, he says. We are sending more spacecraft further into deep space than ever before"
"tracking a spacecraft as it travels through deep space is fundamentally a problem of measuring time. Getting it wrong by just a tiny fraction of a second might mean the difference between your spacecraft safely and gently landing on the surface of another planet. Historically, we have been able to send smallish things extremely far away thanks to very large things here on our home planet."
Voyager 1 is just over 13 billion miles away right now. It takes a signal traveling at the speed of light over 40 hours to get there and back again. It would be great if we could measure that signal time directly at the spacecraft. But the miniaturization of atomic clock technology is difficult.
"An ionbased atomic clock has the potential to completely flip the way we navigate in deep space. With this clock technology, we can now build GPSlike navigation systems at other planets and moons. Imagine having GPS on the Moon or Mars. Imagine in this scenario that we can have a network of communication satellites scattered throughout deep space broadcasting navigation signals."
"autonomy means we can support more spacecraft, more sensors to explore the universe, and it also frees up navigators to work on finding the answers to other questions. In recent years, we have discovered nearly 3,000 planetary systems outside of our own solar system, and those systems are home to almost 4,000 exoplanets."
"Technology has opened new windows into the black box that is our minds. We can genetically engineer neurons to be light sensitive and then use light to control how neurons fire. This can change an animal's behavior, giving us insight into what that neural circuit can do."
"optogenetic tools selectively target neurons that are living in point A, sending messages down wires aimed at point B. This approach allowed us to test the function of each wire within the tangled mess that is our brain. In contrast to drug treatments for anxiety, there's no sedation, no locomotor impairment."
"The first step is to understand how the brain gives rise to feeding behavior. We can eat for two reasons. Seeking pleasure, like tasty food, or avoiding pain, like being hungry. How can we find a treatment for compulsive overeating without messing up the hungerdriven feeding that we need to survive?"
"neuronal circuits drive craving based on behaviors we elicit when we target this pathway. When we silence this pathway, we can suppress and reduce compulsive overeating without altering hungerdriven feeding. Neuroscientist: Every conscious experience that we have is governed by cells in our brain"
"Behavior is still the best and only window into the emotional experience of another. The development of new drug therapies for mental health disorders has hit a brick wall. In the near future, I expect to see a mental health treatment revolution, where we focus on specific neural circuits in the brain."
"neurological circuit reprogramming represents a potential cure, not just a treatment. Exposure therapy at the circuit level. Once we switch the brain into a state of selfhealing, this could potentially have longlasting effects with no side effects. Imagine how dramatically we could reduce rates of suicides and school shootings if everyone who needed mental health support actually got it."
"In 2013, the Denver Post won a Pulitzer Prize for covering the Aurora theater shooting. The paper that once had 300 journalists would now have 70. Since 2004, nearly 1,800 newsrooms have closed in the U.S., the Post says."
"When I started at The Denver Post in 2003, it was among the country's 10 largest newspapers. But as expected, I was forced to resign. The Denver Post is but a few lone journalists doing their admirable best in this husk of a oncegreat paper."
"A great local newsroom acts like a mirror and reflects back to the public. A local paper can mobilize 13 percent of nonvoters to vote, according to a study. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are two of the bestknown local papers."
"In years past, journalists would have thoroughly vetted, factchecked, profiled, debated every contender in the local paper. But in the place of past levels of rigorous reporting and research, the public is increasingly left to interpret dogandponyshow stump speeches and clever campaign ads for themselves."
"CNN's John Sutter says local news is vital to our democracy. Sutter: A properly staffed local newsroom isn't profitable, and in this age of Google and Facebook, it's not going to be. He says it's time to debate a public funding option before the fourth estate disappears."
"The helmet creates an artificial allergy to the color red. It simulates this hypersensitivity by making red things look bigger when you are wearing it. Whenever I see red, the red expands. It's similar to social media's amplification effect, like when you look at something that bothers you."
"The device inside the helmet reshapes reality and projects into our eyes through a set of lenses to create an augmented reality. I picked the color red, because it's intense and emotional, it has high visibility and it's political. In digital media, what we see every day is often mediated, but it's also very nuanced."
"Technology is designed to shape our sense of reality by masking itself as the actual experience of the world. The plugin could dilute the things that are being amplified by an algorithm. It shouts out the hidden filtered voices. For every ad you see on the web page, it shows the amount of money you should be earning."
"Technology is never neutral. It provides a context and frames reality. We could use it to uncover our blind spots and retrain our perception and consequently, choose how we see each other. It's challenging to make it fair and personal without it just becoming another layer of mediation. The same approach could be used with bad intentions."
"Pulmonary disease existing as a comorbidity is also important. The elderly are at greater risk, especially those over 70. It's not clear whether their immune system can handle this virus. The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta keeps track and has updates on a regular basis."
"With the current coronavirus, COVID19, it is two percent or probably less. So it's a much less virulent virus, but it's still a virus that causes mortality. Vaccines are under development right now, there's a lot of research going on."
Human and animal populations are growing closer together in urban areas. This means there is an increase in the risk of humantohuman infections. The elderly and those with comorbidities are likely to be most at risk. The WHO is working with other countries to stop outbreaks.
"The most concerned are people who are, first of all, in developing countries and who don't have access to good medical care. The elderly in all populations are at risk, but especially those who can't get to oxygen. In industrialized countries, it's the very elderly who have comorbidities."
"The world just isn't built for us. There's so many ways that we can get overwhelmed. Some people will flap their arms or make a noise or spin. It can often feel necessary for us to stim. However, it's often frowned upon, and we're forced to hide it."
"Some people think that autistic people do not know right from wrong, avoid attention and usually say the wrong thing at the wrong time. I mask so well sometimes that people don't even know I'm autistic until I give them the big reveal Even something like doing my homework at night becomes very tiring"
"In the world, approximately one percent of the population is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. My inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me express extremes or nothing There's still lots of people that do not see us as equals to other people"
"Autism and other mental conditions should be seen as naturally human, says Steve Silberman. Silberman: If autism was seen as part of a natural human spectrum, then the world could be designed to work better for autistic people. There is not a lot of information out there on what an autistic life actually looks like, so people often resort to stereotypes."
"Pray for Me is a campaign to raise awareness of menstruation in the U.S. and around the world. The campaign is based on four pillars: health, hygiene, education and social justice. Pray For Me was launched by a group of women and girls in St. Louis, Missouri."
"The campaign aims to raise awareness of the importance of a woman's period. It also aims to make it easier for boys to understand their period. The campaign is supported by a number of charities, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."
"Let there be waves of positivity, full of women who bleed with pride, says author. It's exhausting to be told that youre PMSing, she says. Let all know the marvels of menstruation and celebrate it, she adds."
"The story of a man who became a famous doctor. The doctor was summoned to treat the king when he fell ill. But when he entered the kings chamber, he was dismayed to see Death at the foot of the bed. He swiftly spun the bed around, leaving the doctor free to administer the antidote."
"The story of a man who lost his life in a forest. The man's dying wish was to cure his daughter of her illness. But when he tried to do so, he found himself surrounded by Death. He was forced to give up his wish and die."
"The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir is published by Simon & Schuster, priced 16.99. The book explores the role of women in a maledominated society. The author argues that women should be free to choose their own role in society."
The Second Sex was written by French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. The book was a landmark in the field of feminist theory. The author was accused of sexual misconduct by two of her students. She died in 1986 at the age of 80.
"In 1941, de Beauvoir published  the first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations on underwater worlds. She argued that our greatest ethical imperative is to create our own lifes meaning, while protecting the freedom of others to do the same."
"Silent Spring was published in 1962. Rachel Carson's work galvanized a generation of environmental activists. Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after the book's publication. In 1972, the EPA issued a partial ban on the use of DDT."
Carson was the second woman to be hired at the Bureau of Fisheries. She and her friends started the Sierra Leone War Trust for Children. They helped single mothers with children under the age of five. The Trust is still helping the women and children of Sierra Leone.
"Stella was working in Freetown when the first cases of Ebola were announced. She says she cried for hours, asking why this was happening to Sierra Leone. She decided to leave the country and return to her family in London. Stella is about to qualify as a medical doctor."
"The Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone was the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life. I was asked to serve as a new Director of Planning for NERC, which took me right across the country. The National Ebola Response Center built on and implemented that plan, and by the third week of January the number of cases had fallen dramatically."
"The mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, has pledged to plant a million trees in the city. The trees were destroyed in the years following the civil war. The city is now a much cleaner place, with less waste and better sanitation, he says."
"Schizophrenia has some of the strongest genetic links of any psychiatric illness. Children or siblings of people with schizophrenia are ten times likelier to develop the disease. If we can unite behind the power of dissatisfaction, the world will be a better place."
"Multiple genes almost certainly play a role, but we dont know how many, or which ones. Environmental factors like exposure to certain viruses in early infancy might increase the chance  that someone will develop schizophrenia. Some people with schizophrenia show a loss of neural tissue, and its unclear whether this atrophy is a result of the disease itself."
"Schizophrenia was first identified more than a century ago, but we still dont know its exact causes. Every person with schizophrenia has slightly different symptoms, and the first signs can be easy to miss. A first psychotic episode can feature delusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and behavior."
"Freud was an innovator linking ideas across many fields. His concepts have become everyday terms that shape how we understand and talk about our own experiences. He built his theories on scientific ideas that were outdated even in his own time, not just by todays standards."
"Many of Sigmund Freuds ideas dont hold up to modern science, and his clinical practices don't meet  ethical standards. At the same time, he sparked  a revolution in psychology and society. Do they deserve the blame,  credit, or redemption when we put history on trial?"
Sigmund Freud was one of the most innovative thinkers in the history of psychology. He tackled issues medicine  refused to address. Freuds private practice treated women who suffered from what was called female depression He invented baseless unconscious or irrational drivers behind the behavior of trauma survivors.
"A quantity of pearls that can appease the sea monsters must be divisible by 7, 11, and 13. multiplying them together will give us their least common multiple: 1001. If we try 861 times 1001, we get 861,861, and we see something similar  with other examples."
"According to legend, once every thousand years a host of sea monsters emerges from the depths to demand tribute from the floating city of Atlantartica. In the stories, the ruler of the city would feed the creatures a ransom of pearls. The pearls would be split equally between the leviathan and the kraken commanders."
Benjamin Franklin invented what he called double spectacles These have lenses with a single focal power tuned so that near objects come into focus. Today we also have progressive lenses which get rid of the line by smoothly varying the focal power from top to bottom.
"The part of the eye that allows us to refocus to different distances is called the crystalline lens. The muscles surrounding the lens can deform it into different shapes, which in turn changes its focusing power. The last several decades have seen the creation and rapid development of what are called focustunable lenses"
Stanford researchers have developed an autofocals prototype. It uses technology from virtual and augmented reality systems to estimate focusing distance. The prototype was tested on 100 presbyopia sufferers and they found it easier and better focusing than their current correction.
"phthalmologist Leslie Gauthier says autofocals don't compromise like static corrections in use today do. He says the focustunable lens technology is capable of outperforming traditional forms of static correction. It's pretty clear that in the near future, instead of worrying about which pair of glasses to use, we'll be able to just focus on the important things, he says."
"Crisis Text Line launched quietly in August 2013 in Chicago and in El Paso. The people who use our free 24/7 service skew young, because it's text, so they skew young. 45 percent are under the age of 17. 17 percent identify as Hispanic, and 44 percent LGBTQ."
"We use machine learning to stackrank the queue based on severity. It's free, there's no complicated intake survey, so it's really userfriendly. We've trained over 28,000 volunteer crisis counselors who apply online, go through a background check."

"Bethany Jones: Sometimes, people have the ideation, the plan, the means and the timing to hurt themselves or someone else. Jones: In those imminent risk situations, we call 911. She says the best language to riskassess around suicidal ideation isn't to use the words, Are you thinking of committing suicide? Jones: Instead, it's to use words like, 'Are youthinking of death or dying?'"
"Since the start of COVID in early March, a 40 percent increase in our volume. 78 percent of our conversations include words like freaked out, scared, panic People are worried about the COVID virus, and so they're nervous about symptoms and they're concerned for family."
"32 percent of texters identify as coming from household incomes under 20,000 dollars. That's up from our typical 19 percent low income. We're seeing more people reach out with fears of bankruptcy, fears of homelessness and other financial ruin. So we need to grow. Quickly."
"The TED Talk is a global network of strangers helping strangers around the world. We'll be at your fingertips, in your pocket, says founder and CEO of TED. No matter what age, no matter what your situation is or where you live, we'll be there"

"We are all in this together, and we are all very much behind the curve, he says. We have to work around the clock to make sure that we get the results we want, he adds. It's a long way to go, but we are getting there, he insists."
"The first COVID19 genome on the African continent was sequenced within 48 hours. Pardis Sabeti: The whole idea of Sentinel is that we all stand guard over each other I believe that with technologies and knowledge and then sharing information, we can do better, he says."
TED's Audacious Project approved funding for us to massively scale up our work with the goal of discovering seven new classes of antibiotics against seven of the world's deadly bacterial pathogens. The Antibiotics AI Project is founded on our proof of concept research that led to the discovery of a novel broadspectrum antibiotic called halicin.
"Halicin has potent antibacterial activity against almost all antibioticresistant bacterial pathogens. The frequency at which bacteria develop resistance against halicin is remarkably low. In the case of Cipro, after just one day, we saw resistance. Imagine now what we could do with this technology against SARSCoV2."
"The project seeks to harness the power of machine learning to replenish our antibiotic arsenal. The technology can be used to search for antiviral compounds that could help us fight the current pandemic. With the tools of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, we can win the fight against this novel coronavirus."
"Opioid drugs act on the bodys opioid system by binding to receptors in the brain. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, it triggers the release of dopamine. dopamine is linked to feelings of pleasure and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria that characterizes an opioid high."
"The body compensates by increasing  its number of noradrenaline receptors. This increased sensitivity allows the body to continue functioning normally. When someone who is physically dependent on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. This oversensitivity causes muscle aches, stomach pains, fever, and vomiting."
"Opioid addiction is rarely a standalone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence are also struggling with a mental health condition. A drug called naloxone is currently  our best defense against overdose. There are both inpatient  and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services,  and psychotherapy."
"In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began  to market opioid painkillers aggressively. More than 3,000 years ago, a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. The number of opioid painkiller prescriptions skyrocketed and so did cases of opioid addiction."
"In Crazy Mode, you react to everything as if it is red. Red is immediately lifethreatening. Yellow is serious, but not immediately life threatening. Green is minor, but minor. You can't take care of them all at once, but you don't have to."
"An emergencyroom doctor shares his tips for dealing with stress. Remember, relentlessly triage, he says. Know your reds, and do not let your nonreds distract you from them It's OK if it's not perfect, he adds. No one's going to die"
"The more decisions we have to make, the more exhausted our brain gets and the less it is capable of making good decisions. Step two to go from Crazy Mode into Ready Mode is to expect and design for crazy. Here are four easy examples you can use in your daily lifestyle."
"When we are in Crazy Busy Mode, we are simply less capable of handling the busy. When it comes to exercise, store all the equipment that you need for a certain activity together, charged and ready. And decrease temptations, for anyone driven by sugar cravings."
"When we catastrophize and we start to get that tunnel vision, we can't solve anything that way. Research shows that when you prime your brain with compassion, we disrupt tunnel vision and internal monologue. You widen your perception, so your brain can actually take in broader information, so you see more possibilities."
"Dr. Darria: I focused not on my fear, but on the mother and the baby and what they needed me to do I suddenly realized that despite their own problems that had brought them to the emergency room, they had all come together to root for this baby"
How we react to stress has been shown to be modifiable. You can be as busy as an emergency department without feeling like you're crazy busy. How? By using the same tactics that we use to cope with stress. You're ready. Thank you.
"Coronaviruses have a slower mutation rate than other RNA viruses. This means our immune systems, drugs, and vaccines might be able to recognize them for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS."
"There are hundreds of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, and can cause disease. Four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID19, has features of each."
"Primers are used to identify the virus. Immunoassays tap into the immune systems memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously been infected. The presence of IgM antibodies suggests a recent infection, but theyre unreliable in diagnosing current infections."
"Researchers in Singapore were able to create one for SARSCoV2 even before COVID19 was declared a pandemic. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further boosting accuracy. Genetic information can be encoded  via DNA or RNA."
"In the early 1950s, Noam Chomsky proposed a theory based on the observation that the key  to this versatility seems to be grammar. He suggested that there are  grammatical rules that apply to all languages, and that the rules are innate. Chomsky and other researchers set out to investigate the two main components of universal grammar."
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a pandemic, meaning that its spreading worldwide. The idea here is to simultaneously starve the virus, everywhere, through a combination of quarantine, social distancing, and restricting travel. Racing through it is a quick fix,  but would be a global catastrophe."
"Vaccination, assisted by as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner. The WHO will likely declare  the pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained. Breakthroughs in treatment  and prevention of symptoms can make viruses much less dangerous, and therefore require less extreme containment measures."
"In times like these, theres an urgent need for a vaccine to create widespread immunity with minimal loss of life. Inactivated vaccines take a much faster approach, directly applying heat, acid, or radiation to weaken the pathogen. Subunit vaccines, that inject  harmless fragments of viral proteins, can also be created quickly."
"Vaccine development can generally be split into three phases. In exploratory research, scientists experiment with different approaches to find safe and replicable vaccine designs. In clinical testing, vaccines are evaluated for safety, efficacy, and side effects. Finally, theres manufacturing, where vaccines are produced and distributed for public use."
"When a new pathogen emerges, our bodies and healthcare systems are left vulnerable. Traditional attenuated vaccines create long lasting resilience. But they rely on weakened viral strains that must be cultivated in nonhuman tissue. One of the major answers as to why Donald Trump is President of the United States is racism."
"Ibram Woodruff: The heartbeat of racism itself has always been denial We need a different type of government with a different set of priorities, he says. We have a racial wealth gap that's growing, Woodruff says."
"Community member Dana Perls asks, How do you suggest liberal white organizations effectively address problems of racism? I would basically rip up those diversity statements and write a new statement, and that's a statement committed to antiracism I also think it's critically important for workplaces to diversify their staff"
"Ilyse Hogue: We're either being racist, or we're being antiracist. The solution is not marching. The other alternative is not caring when black people die of police violence or COVID. We're expressing notions that the racial groups are equals. Or, you're not."
"We should be very clear about whether we're expressing racist ideas, she says. To be antiracist is to admit when we expressed a racist idea, she adds. You can't really see that and reject that if you're not rejecting and understanding and challenging homophobia too"
"CNN's Chris Cevallos talks with antiracism activist John Sutter. Sutter: To be racist is to deny the racial inequities that pervade American society We have to have some sort of consequence, public consequence, for people acting in a racist manner, Sutter says."
"Ilyse Hogue: We should use our feelings, how horrible we feel about what is going on, to put into place, put into practice, antiracist power and policies I want to built a just and equitable society, Hogue says. The only way we're going to even begin that process is if we admit our racism and start building an anti racist world"
"Ibram Wood: What I am, a black male, should not matter. Who I am should matter There's so much beauty here amid all this pain, he says. I just want to peel away and remove away all of those scabs of racist policies"
"CNN's John Sutter asked the panelists what gives them hope in the U.S. IXK: There's an America that can be created, and people are calling for this, and that is always the beginning Sutter: I know that in order to bring about change, we have to believe in change"
"Ibram: We should view young, black and Latino voters who are trying to decide whether to vote as swing voters. We need to encourage and persuade them, and then for these other swing voters, it's the hardest for them to vote because of voter suppression policies, he says."
"Ibram: To be antiracist is to believe that there's nothing wrong or inferior about black people or any other racial group We see these racial disparities all around us, and then we start to figure out, OK, what policies are behind so many black people being subjected to police? We need to upend those policies and replace them with more antiracist policies"
"CNN's John Sutter talks with Dr. King about the role of race in American society. King: People of color have long utilized the most basic power that every human being has Anyone who is not viewing racism as the problem is not being antiracist, King says."
"When you believe and have consumed racist ideas, you're not going to even believe change is necessary. The only other alternative, the only other explanation to persisting inequity and injustice, is power and policy. To be antiracist, again, is to recognize that there's only two causes of racial inequity: either there's something wrong with people, or there'sSomething wrong with power."
"White Americans need to recognize their privileges, says IXK. White Americans have more, due to racist policy, he says. IXK: If we had a more equitable society, would we have more? I think that white Americans, too, need to realize their privileges, he adds."
"Researchers and statisticians have come up with dozens of intricate ways of conducting and counting votes. But whichever one you choose, it's possible to imagine it delivering an unfair result. It's impossible to design a voting system that doesn't violate at least some theoretically desirable criteria."
"CNN.com's John Sutter asks: Is plurality vote really the fairest method? Sutter: What if we tried a system  like instant runoff voting, which accounts for the full range  of peoples preferences rather than just their top choices?"
"Bias can infect every aspect of our criminal justice system. The more black, the more deathworthy defendants are. Bias can also influence how teachers discipline students. Categorization and the bias that it seeds allow our brains to make judgments more quickly."
"We are all vulnerable to bias, but we don't act on bias all the time. How we behave online is a reflection of how we behave in the world. We don't want to create an easytouse system that can amplify bias and deepen racial disparities."
"Nextdoor asks people to think about what they are doing that could be suspicious. It also asks them to describe the person, not just their race or gender. If you see something, say something, the site says. You can't add friction in every situation, and especially for people who make splitsecond decisions"
"In 2017, before we added that intelligenceled question to the form, officers made about 32,000 stops across the city. In that next year, with the addition of this question, that fell to 19,000. And stopping fewer black people did not make the city any more dangerous."
"When my eldest son was 16 years old, he discovered that when white people look at him, they feel fear. My son senses their discomfort, and he smiles to put them at ease, to calm their fears. The problem is that the vast majority of the footage from these cameras is not used by police departments."
Saida Aden Said is a refugee from Somalia. She is studying at Southern New Hampshire University's Global Education Movement. The project aims to bring bachelor's degrees and pathways to employment to refugees and those who would otherwise not have access to higher education.
"Nadia Dambrine Dusabireme is studying at SNHU in Kakuma, South Africa. She says the degree is competencybased and not timebound. There are no classes, lectures or final exams, she says."
SNHU is combining competencybased online learning with inperson learning. The model is a big way to shake the traditional way of having tertiary education. It can transform the lives of students from the country's vulnerable and refugee communities. It's also resulting in the 95 percent graduation rate.
"Sasha Aden fled Somalia after her family was forced to leave the country. She now runs a nonprofit that advocates for women's education. Aden: I want to be someone who is, like, an ambassador and encourage them to learn and tell them it is never too late"
"BG: We need leadership in terms of admitting that we've still got a huge problem here. The innovation tools, that's where the foundation's work on antibodies, vaccines, we have deep expertise, and it's outside of the private sector. There's no market signal for that."
"Gates: We need a leader who keeps us up to date, is realistic and shows us the right behavior It is a bit unusual here how much we've had to rely on Fauci as opposed to the CDC, he says. There's no case where we get much below the current death rate"
"There's three vaccines that are, if they work, are the earliest. Novavax, Sanofi, Merck are three or four months behind that. We have data that looks potentially good but not definitive, particularly will it work in the elderly."
"Bill Gates: Most of the deaths will be in developing countries, despite the huge deaths we've seen in Europe and the US. The US has put more money out to fund the basic research on these vaccines than any country by far, he says."
"The US leads in every other global health problem, BG says. The world always expected the US to at least be at the head of the table, he says. BG: The worst thing, the withdrawal from WHO, is that we need that coordination through WHO."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to Bill Gates about the controversy surrounding the flu vaccine. Gates: It's a new thing that there's conspiracy theories. Most of that, I would say, is global Some people are taking this seriously enough to make really quite horrible threats, he says."
"California virologist says he's unsure of what to say or do about Laura Ingraham's claims of a conspiracy. CA: Anyone who's watching this who thinks for a minute that this man is involved in some kind of conspiracy, you want your head examined He says Ingraham owes Bill Gates an apology and a retraction."
"Bill Gates: We have to do better on it. We have to get back to a world where information can be trusted It's really hard to give away that much money, he says of the Giving Pledge movement. I do video calls with lots of friends. I have friends in Europe that, who knows when I'll see them"
Gates: We need to up the ambition level of philanthropists. Gates: People give through passion. The way you're going to pick is you see somebody who's sick. The Gates Foundation's goal is to help people find causes they connect to.
CNN's John Defterios has been working on a series of stories on the impact of climate change. He says the world needs to know more about the effects of global warming on the environment. Defterio: We need to make sure that we don't lose any of the benefits that we've gained from climate change
"In May and June in the US, the numbers were slightly better than some of the models predicted, says Bill Gates. In other parts of the country, primarily the South right now, you have increases that are offsetting that, he says. Gates: A little bit of good work goes a long way"
"The disease is not coughing, it's singing, laughing, talking, actually, still. The transmission dynamics of this disease are more difficult than even the experts predicted. The good news is, some innovation we already have, and we'll have more, even in the fall."
The amount of virus you get in your upper respiratory area is somewhat disconnected. Some people will have a lot here and very little in their lungs. The worst case in terms of spreading is somebody who's got a lot in the upper respiratory tract but almost none in the lungs.
"WHO did not advise that people wear masks early on in the pandemic. The WHO was worried about taking them away from frontline medical providers. In retrospect, was that a terrible mistake that they made? BG: All the experts feel bad that the value of masks was downplayed."
"BG: How do you make tradeoffs between the benefits, say, of going to school versus the risk of people getting sick because they go to school? BG: If you just look at the health aspect, we have opened up too liberally."
"Selfdriving robots navigate quiet alleys and sidewalks on a walking pace and have a secured cargo to deliver you food and supplies. By my calculations, Americans order over 20 million restaurant deliveries every single day. But how do we get some of these deliveries off the road?"
"We want to surprise and delight them, so that we can win them over on first impression. We started with eyes, because eyes are universal. They can show where the robot is going or if it's confused. Plus, eyes make robots more human."
Nine out of 10 of the world's food is delivered in cars. We are moving a burrito in a twoton car 20 million times a day. What if we used movement to create a universal language? We created a running sound with frequent gaps so that people with visual impairments could locate their robots.
"Hollywood also promised us some really cool robots that would run our errands or keep us company. The energy to bring you that burrito is actually bringing you a twoton metal cage with heated seats. If you are a robot and you see small kids, run towards the closest adult."
"In America, for every car, there are four parking spots. In some downtowns, over half of the real estate is for cars. We are entering this new era where insentient objects are going to get up and move freely. We've got to make sure they don't look like aliens."
"Poverty was like the sun and the moon to the poorest of the poor, writes David Frum. For poverty reduction programs to succeed, they would need to instill hope and selfworth, he says. Frum: BRAC went on to pioneer the graduation approach, which addresses both income poverty and the poverty of hope."
"Two million Bangladeshi women have lifted themselves and their families out of ultrapoverty. The program, which costs 500 dollars per household, runs for only two years. Researchers at the London School of Economics found that 92 percent of participants had maintained or increased their income, assets and consumption."
"Brac's plan is to help another 21 million people lift themselves out of ultrapoverty in eight countries over the next six years. BRAC is working to engage governments to help them to adopt and scale graduation programs themselves, maximizing the impact of the billions of dollars they already allocate to fight poverty."
"By the end of 2019, about 400 million people were living in ultrapoverty worldwide. The brain accesses many possible meanings at the same time, before the word has been fully identified. Context also helps guide us towards the intended meaning of words with multiple interpretations."
"The average 20yearold knows between 27,000 and 52,000 different words. Speech comprehension is different from reading comprehension, but its similar to sign language comprehension. The key to our ability to understand speech is the brain's role as a parallel processor, meaning it can do multiple different things at the same time."
"Sleeping well stimulates the production of numerous different immune factors. Women sleeping five hours or less a night are almost 70 percent more likely to develop pneumonia. Sleep can play a role in your successful immunization. If you're not getting sufficient sleep in the week or days before you get your flu shot, it may render that vaccination far less effective."
"I am Jomama Jones. Some call me a soul sonic superstar, and I agree, though even in my past that was from the future There's so much history recorded through their touches and marks of the future sketched on their palms. Now look at your hands  now go on with your life"
"Jomama Jones is the person in me I turn to as a guide. The last straw had come the previous winter when they had gunned down Fred Hampton. Overwhelmed with fear and rage and grief, Uncle Freeman tried to game his future. He gripped too tight, and he started playing the numbers."
"I jumped up and I grabbed that hammer and I brought it crashing down on that pig, he says. Right now, it feels as though everything is breaking beyond repair, he adds. But that breaking apart can be a breaking open, no matter how violent and uncertain and fearsome"
"What if I told you we won't all make it? asks the poet. What if? he asks. I don't know who I am anymore, but I'm here to help you You're new again, and that's just how we need you, he says."
"The Harlem Children's Zone is working to improve the lives of children in New York City. One in four families in Harlem report food insecurity, and 57 percent report a loss of income or a job. We know Sean and millions like him all across the country deserve to have everything that this world has to offer, without inequality robbing them of that opportunity, says the group's founder."
"The Harlem community has developed a comprehensive relief and recovery response. The response is focused on five primary areas of need, and already servicing families like Sean's. It includes emergency relief funds, access to essential goods and information, and bridging the digital divide. It also aims to mitigate the mental health crisis."
"We need to ensure that our families have access to telehealth and other virtual supports. We will have impact on three levels. Individual impact on the ground, across a number of outcomes in education, in health, in economics. There's communitylevel impact across six cities, again through our amazing partners, that will reach an additional 70,000 people. And then national impact through policy advocacy, but through capacity building at scale."
"We've had over 500plus communities across the US and 70plus countries come and visit us to learn our model We've reduced obesity rates in our schools and have close to 1,000 students enrolled in college. And we've had 7,000 graduates of our community college"
"Mapping the most vulnerable places in our world just hasn't been a priority for forprofit companies. Volunteers working anywhere in the world turn satellite images into maps through drawing the buildings and roads on top of them. The resulting map is public good, free and open for anyone to use."
"People from all walks of life are helping to map the world with OpenStreetMap. The maps have been used by search and rescue operations in Haiti. They've also been used to provide polio vaccinations to children in rural Nigeria. And they've mapped the camps, routes and new homes of refugees fleeing South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela."
"The OpenStreetMap project aims to make it easier for people to find each other on the map. Over the next five years, the project will map an area of the world that is home to more than 1 billion people. The project will also use technology to make the mapmaking process more efficient."
"6,000 volunteers across the world mapped every home and every road in Puerto Rico. Responders then used those maps to assess the state of buildings and roads. Frontline health workers and humanitarians are literally waiting for you. If you can swipe left or right, you can help."
"As far as we know, only humans have language. While humans speak around 7,000 distinct languages, any child can learn any language. Language may have begun to take shape during the Pleistocene, 2 to 3 million years ago. Brain size tripled, and bipedalism freed the hands for communication."
"Language is so intimately tied to complex thought, perception, and motor functions that its difficult to untangle its biological origins. To what extent did language shape humanity? What came first, the vast number of possible scenarios we can envisage, or our ability to share them?"
Parrotfish can eat even the tiniest scraps of seaweed. Their beak is full of tightlypacked teeth which can scrape and grind rock. They can also detect changes in water pressure in the water around them. This information can be used by other fish to warn them of danger.
"Climate change and pollution are lowering corals natural defenses while contributing to runaway seaweed growth. Overfishing has reduced the number of parrotfish, as well as other seaweed eaters, such as surgeonfish and rabbitfish. seaweed is vital to this ecosystem."
"Bertram says 840, Cassandra reports 700, and Draco declares 423. The highest numbers on the two dice are 17 and 18, so in 20 rolls, the greatest possible total is 20 times 35, or 700. The probability of this is 1 over 6 to the 40th power, or 1 in about 13 nonillion."
"A father has devised a competition to test his children, and ordered you to choose the winner. Each potential heir will be given the same two sixsided dice. Pick a number from each die,  and add them up. No matter which combination you choose, the result ends in a 0 or a 5."
"The dice are fair, so each side is equally likely to come up. A contestants score starts at zero, and each turn, they should add the total  of the two numbers rolled to their score. The highestscoring player who remains will be the new heir to the throne."
A pair of northern white rhinos are the only two left in the world that can reproduce. They are being used as surrogates for a new species of rhino. The plan is to have the new rhino born by the end of the year.
"Poachers began illegally hunting northern white rhinos for their horns 50 years ago. Concerned conservationists began trying  to breed them in captivity in the 1970s. Only four rhinos were ultimately born through the ambitious breeding program. The ultimate goal,  which will take decades, is to establish a breeding population in their original range."
"Artificial intelligence can only do things that humans can do, says Refik. Refik: Can data become a pigment? And, if so, how far have we come since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner? So we began to imagine what I would call the poetics of data"
Bosphorus is one of the first public works of art to be created using artificial intelligence. The work uses wind data to create a sense of the world around us. The artist says the work is a reminder of the power of the human mind to create new knowledge.
Melting Memories is a new series of short films about the power of memory. The series uses machinelearning technology to create a virtual reality of New York City. The project was inspired by the story The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges.
"The Walt Disney Concert Hall was designed by Frank Gehry, one of his alltime heroes. The entire archive, going back 100 years, became projections on the building's skin, 42 projectors to achieve this futuristic public experience in the heart of Los Angeles."
"In 1901, David Hnig published a paper that forever changed our understanding of taste. The maximum sensation for sweet was located at the tongues tip; bitter flavors were strongest at the back. His research led to what we know today as the taste map."
"In 1912, a rough version of the map appeared in a newspaper article that cautiously described some of the mysteries behind taste and smell research. The image spread to textbooks and classrooms as a purported truth of how we experience taste. The only problem with this map,  is that its wrong."
"Hnig analyzed taste sensitivities across the tongue for the four basic flavors. He says colleges have kept ratcheting up the standards because it doesn't seem fair to admit less qualified people and reject better qualified people. Some people get what they deserve, and that's just the way it is, he says. We are wrecking a generation with this kind of competition"
The author proposes that college admissions be decided by a lottery. He says it would be a way to show that good fortune is not under our control. The author says he hates the idea that really important things in life happen by chance. The writer is a professor at Swarthmore College.
"When I was in seventh grade, I met a lovely young girl who became my friend. She became my best friend, then she became my wife. I had very little to do with this. I went off to college, and in my first semester, I signed up for a class in psychology."
"I'm lucky to have had a platform and a voice at something like TED, he says. Working hard and playing by the rules is just no guarantee of anything, he adds. I deserve that success, just as you probably deserve your success as well"
"What do we owe people who struggle, work hard and are less lucky than we are? John Rawls asked. What we want is a society that is pretty damn equal, so that even the unlucky will be able to live decent, meaningful and satisfying lives"
"Photographer Rhonda Jacobs has been documenting endangered species and habitats around the world for the last decade. She has used a technique that captures the passage of time, literally from day to night, all within a single image. In 2015, in Paris, the world agreed to limit the planet's warming to one and a half degrees Celsius."
"I'm here to speak for the countless animals dying across this planet because they have nowhere left to go, he says. It shows a crisis in human governance, where our political systems make it impossible to act in longterm interests, he adds."
"We are at a moment parallel to Rio. Now is the time to take action. We have the science, we have the solutions and we all are experiencing climate change. We've seen governments and institutions across all sectors working quickly, working together. It is a warning. If we don't listen, if weDon't change, next time could be far worse."
"Rio de Janeiro mayor: We have 10 years to make a difference in the lives of our children We need to change the way we think about the environment, he says. It's time to change our way of thinking and living"
"Climate change is the most consequential period in history, he says. If we do not act in this decade, the damage that we have done will be irreversible. The most vulnerable, those with the fewest resources and those who've done the least to cause climate change will be impacted the most."
"We must protect and restore nature, clean our air, revive our oceans, build a wastefree world and fix our climate, he says. If we achieve these goals, by 2030 our lives won't be worse, and we won't have to sacrifice everything we enjoy."
I'm committed to using the unique position that I have to help set those Earthshot goals and reward people across every sector of society and in every part of the world who do their bit to help achieve them. I'm determined to both start and end this decade as an optimist.
"In the span of two generations, the world has changed more than in the previous 20,000 years. We have access to a huge amount of information. We need to work together to solve the world's problems. We can do this by working together across borders."
"We need to stop thinking within national frameworks and start thinking globally. In the modern world, no wall or border can protect us from crisis. Multinational companies like Facebook or Amazon already operate across borders, but they pay very little taxes in very few countries. We lack a global tax system."
Now! is a group of people who want to change the way the world works. They want to use the power of the internet to make a difference in the world. They hope to raise awareness of issues that affect people across the globe. They are also hoping to use their power to push for change in China.
"French politician Philippe Cousteau says the EU is a symbol of a more open and global society. He says supernational institutions like the United Nations exist, but their enforcement mechanisms are limited. He calls on the WHO to ensure that health workers across the world, regardless of their nationalities, get priority access to future vaccines."
"We need a true democratic and accountable global system of governance, she says. NOW! was only launched on the first of January 2020 but already counts thousands of members in more than 100 countries. I don't know whether I have the one solution  no one does, she adds. We need to prove the case before we can change the way the world works"
Volt is the first panEuropean political movement. The movement aims to end the practice of putting national interests before global issues. The campaign has raised more than 1.5 million for charity since its launch in May. The group's website is: http://www.vlt.org.uk/vlt/
"Earth Speakr is a new series on CNN.com. The series features young people speaking out on issues of the day. This week's episode is about climate change. The first episode airs on Monday, September 17. The second episode airs Tuesday, September 18."
"How to tell the stories of humanity and nature at a time when our planet is burning? There is no precedent for what we're about to experience collectively whether it's political, social or ecological. When we come together, we can find the answers. All you have to do is listen."
"Trees are the link between earth and sky, says author. They make cradles, wine corks, and produce the most beautiful music out of us They are also the source of pain for those who live in their shadow."
"As the uterus grows, it pushes on the diaphragm, the muscle that expands and contracts with each breath. To compensate, the hormone progesterone acts as a respiratory stimulant, making the woman breathe faster so both she and the baby can both get enough oxygen."
"Pregnancy affects the brain, but its effects here are some of the least understood. Recent studies show differences in brain scans after pregnancy and early parenting. These changes could help  with parenting skills, such as an increased ability to read  facial cues."
The world needs to reduce its carbon emissions by 20% by the year 2050. The U.S. needs to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 30% by 2020. The world needs more energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar power.
"We must make sure that each country, each company, and international organization has a transition plan to reach zero net emissions. We also need to see much greater efforts to build resilience in vulnerable countries, which do least to cause climate change. We are on track for three degrees at least."
"Climate disruption is causing unprecedented wildfires, more intense and frequent cyclones, floods, droughts, and other weather extremes. In every country, it is the poorest and most vulnerable who are hardest hit, despite having done least to cause the problem. Europe has set its objective: to become the first carbonneutral continent by 2050."
"The European Union is moving from a 40 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to an at least 55 percent reduction by 2030. This means leading an entire continent towards transitioning to clean energy, reinventing our infrastructure, and much, much more. European citizens, who, in their overwhelming majority, consider climate change a very serious problem."
The European Union is open to cooperate with anyone who's ready to engage in this journey. We are a political and economic union with 27 countries and the total population of 450 million people. We have secured lasting peace among us. And I strongly believe we can also achieve our next challenge: becoming the first carbonneutral continent.
"Andri Snr Magnason: We need to start connecting to the future in an intimate and urgent way. When I became president of the European Commission, I sent a clear signal. The European Green Deal is both our vision for a climateneutral continent and a dedicated road map."
Iceland's Slheimajkull glacier has been lost to climate change. Iceland is one of 197 countries that agreed to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United States is currently withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. The Climate Action Tracker monitors the climate commitments of 36 countries.
"The EU is taking steps in the right direction to make member countries more sustainable. But actions on the ground remain divided. China is the largest market for wind and solar power, but also for new coalfired power plants. Denmark, Scotland and the state of South Australia are almost there already."
"Of the 36 countries analyzed, only two are taking enough action to restrain global warming to 1.5 degrees. The Gambia has pledged to reduce its emissions, despite being one of the developing countries that has contributed least to the problem. Every other country is failing. 2020 is the year national governments were supposed to come together and strengthen their targets."
"Every second, a huge amount of energy smashes into our greenhouse. Much of that heat used to escape back into space, keeping us at a stable, warm temperature. But then something changed and we began to spew enough carbon dioxide to fill billions of greenhouses each day."
"To stop global warming, we have to get our greenhouse gas emissions down to zero. Planting more trees will help, but trees alone can't get us to net zero. We'll also have to capture greenhouse gases from the air and store them permanently."
