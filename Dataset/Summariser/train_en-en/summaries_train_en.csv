"Gore and his wife Tipper were driving from Nashville to a farm 50 miles east of the city. They stopped for dinner at a Shoney's, a low-cost family restaurant chain. A waitress recognized the couple and said they were former Vice President Al Gore and Tipper Gore."
"CNN's John Defterios writes a weekly column on the state of the news in the world. This week, he writes about his trip to Nigeria to meet with a group of young people. He says he was inspired by the young people he met in the country."
"Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? Gore: I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. Gore: ""It's like beach-combing, you know?"""
There is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Carbon Capture and Sequestration is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.
"CNN's John Defterios: Be a green consumer. He says it's easier than you think. There is a carbon calculator, he says. He urges people to make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. Defterio: Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice."
"Climate change is a global issue, and we need to take action to address it. We need to make our businesses carbon-neutral, and invest sustainably. We also need to teach others, learn about it, talk about it. I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed."
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. The role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power.
"President Obama: Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. ""This is not a political issue. It's a true story -- every bit of this is true,"" Obama says. Obama: ""We have to buy a lot of those ads"""
"Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like. The idea was that you could take waste paper and make it into fuel. But this device was very slow to work with, so students made their own. They were able to triple the efficiency."
"Haitian students have developed a way to turn waste from sugarcane into charcoal. The waste is called ""bagasse"" and has no other use. It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking. But it can be used to make a very thick, sticky porridge, which you can use to bind together the charcoal."
"The project has the potential to make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five. Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires."
"Scientists have developed a way to make a stronger briquette to compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year. There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to Ghana last month. He found a way to use agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel. The technology transfer is so easy, he says, it's ""the most exciting thing in my life right now"""
"This is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products. They can generate income from this. It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics, or environment and economics."
"If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for."
"Amy Smith: We're working on ways to do low-cost water quality testing. Smith: It's a difficult thing -- it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame, Smith says."
"The majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day."
"Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context. We have three critical terms: economy, civil society and the state. If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question, then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate."
"The least important form of capital, in this project, is financial capital -- money. Money is not capital in most of the developing countries. The first challenge is to rethink, fundamentally, the issue of the time. The absolute majority of the world's population are below 20."
"Ashraf Ghani was finance minister of Afghanistan until recently. Ghani: ""What scares me most is -- is you, lack of your engagement"" Chris Anderson: ""I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development"""
"Afghanistan has been subjected to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power. The Red Army for 10 continuous years, 110,000 strong, literally terrorizing the country. The sky: every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear."
"Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world. The country has a long history of violence, but has also made progress in recent years. The U.S. government is working with the Afghan government to improve the country's infrastructure."
"Clare Lockhart: ""I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry"" ""The question now, however, is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation,"" she says. ""We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics"""
"NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line. ""We've shied away from it because we're afraid of it,"" he says."
"CNN's John Defterios looks back at the first 100 years of aviation. He says it's a long way from the days of the Wright brothers and the Wright Brothers. Defterio: ""We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space"""
"The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. These things tend to happen every 25 years, with an overlap. You don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it."
"SpaceShipOne CEO: ""I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none"" In 2003, everyone that the U.S. sent to space was killed. ""We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines,"" he says."
"Rutan: ""I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule"" Rutan: The moon doesn't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want."
"The U.S. is making progress on space exploration. The space race was won by the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s. The U.N. is now making progress in the field of space exploration, says Dr. Richard Branson."
"CNN's John Sutter says the U.S. has a long way to go before it can compete with Russia in space. Sutter: ""I think we're going to have to wait a long time to see if we can do it"""
"Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself: they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it -- your anger, whatever. It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile."
"Every car you see out there is sculpted by hand. The tension, that discovery, that push for something new -- and at the same time, that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship -- that's as strong in cars as it is in anything."
"Car designers don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense. We're not trying to find vanity and beauty, we're trying tofind the beauty in the truth. We don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it."
"BMW design boss: ""I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue"" ""We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic; it's really a truth,"" she says. ""I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable"""
"BMW chief executive says the company has to have a shared intimacy with its designers. ""We are all a little bit like Pygmalion, we are completely in love with our own creations,"" he says. ""You want to do cars, you've got to go outside to do them,"" he adds."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a project with a team of engineers in Germany. They are trying to come up with a way to make a car that is more like an SUV. The project is called ""Deep Blue"" and the team is called the ""Engineers of the Future"""
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to Malibu, California, to meet with engineers working on a car design project. The team lived in Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house for six months as they worked on the project. Defterio: ""I was hoping that these two teams would get together, and this collusion of incredible creativity"""
CNN's John Defterios has been working on a project with a team of engineers. They are trying to solve a problem that has been going on for more than a decade. The problem is that they can't agree on how to solve the problem.
"""I went nuts. I screamed at them, I yelled at them,"" he says of BMW's designers. ""What the hell is going on around here?"" he asks. ""I went into these people; how could they take BMW's money and produce nothing?"""
"Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago. The Sorcerer II Expedition is trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles. The experiments are incredibly simple. We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters."
Scientists have mapped more than half of all the genes on the planet. They hope to use this data to understand the origin of life on Earth. Scientists are now beginning to write the code for life on the Earth. The first step is to find out what genes are involved in life.
The first sequence of a free-living organism was published 10 years ago. The pool expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so. The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them.
" synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed an exciting new method that allowed them to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period. The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses."
"Scientists have created a synthetic genome that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed. It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours, after its chromosomes are literally blown apart. The first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome. Scientists think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential."
"We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight. We're also combining cellulases, the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol. We think we can make a million different chromosomes a day. And we're going to be able to do this by the end of the century."
"Apple's iPod violated every bit of common wisdom, says former CEO Steve Jobs. The lesson was: simplicity sells, and there are signs that the world is getting the message, he says. The Sonos thing -- it's catching on, Jobs says."
"When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera."
"""Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist"" premieres Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET on TED.com. The show also airs on PBS stations in the U.S. and Canada."
"CNN's John Sutter writes a weekly technology column for the New York Times. Sutter says he's always been a technology nut, and he loves the column. He says the column comes with a downside: he gets a lot of email from frustrated readers."
"The problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use, he says. He calls it ""software rage"" People are feeling overwhelmed. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use."
"Apple's new voice-recognition software is making it easier for people to use voice-activated devices. The company has recorded calls to collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. ""Some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable,"" he says."
"Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions. Software is not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year, and every year they say, ""We've added more features"""
"Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in the Eisenhower administration. Software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. As you add more features, where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools."
"Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps. If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up."
The Type a Word Wizard lets users type letters from a drop-down menu. It's designed to be as consistent as possible with real-world equivalents. The tool is available on Windows 8.1 and later versions will be available on Mac and iOS.
"Apple is not the only company that has embraced the cult of simplicity, he says. Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this, he adds. ""If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned"""
"Apple CEO Tim Cook: ""I write the code that makes the whole world run"" Cook: Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&amp;D. ""I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss,"" Cook says."
"Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system is designed to work with existing software. The new operating system has been designed to make it easier for people to use Microsoft's software. Microsoft's Windows 8 software is meant to be used in conjunction with other software, not in its own right."
"Apple co-founder Steve Jobs returns to the company after a 12-year absence. Jobs: ""Don't cry for me, Cupertino. The truth is, I never left you"" ""I made a fortune over at Pixar. I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are,"" Jobs says."
"The architect says the project is ""substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before"" The goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be, he says. ""Having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter, I think makes it a more powerful dialogue"""
The World Trade Center site in New York City is set to be closed for six months. The city is trying to find a solution to the problem of how to keep the site open. The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
"""I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities,"" says Mayor Bloomberg. ""I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces,"" he adds. ""We're looking for other things,"" he says."
"The memorial was designed to be written on. The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable. Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. The kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection, and its being there, is part of its extraordinary presence."
"David Rockwell is a New York-based architect. His work is highly sensual, even hedonistic. Rockwell: ""I like that word 'hedonistic' ... it's about pleasure"" The walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials."
"""We had to find a way to make this happen,"" says the designer. ""It was just extraordinary,"" he says. ""We were able to do it in a few days."" ""It's not about winning or losing, it's about making a difference,"" he adds."
The city of New York is rebuilding a pier on the Hudson River. The project is called PS 234. The city is trying to make the pier more accessible to all residents. It is the first time the city has rebuilt a pier since World War II.
"Dan Rather: I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin, and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life. It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it, where the families of the victims had left notes to them. And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV."
"A half a million dollar project was needed to rebuild the World Trade Center. A developer who owns Rockefeller Center volunteered to underwrite the entire expense. The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars. Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches on a new way to visit and view the scene."
"Jim Axelrod: People were amazed at the destruction, but there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers. Axelrod spent a lot of time in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul. The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding."
"""We knew that one way or another this was going to happen,"" says project leader. ""It's all incredibly humble. It's all scaffolding and plywood. It doesn't have to be this way,"" he adds. ""We want it to be a place for people to sit and reflect"""
"The iBOT was designed to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful and flexible. It can be attached to a kilogram of propane, and you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose. The design was inspired by a kind of ""Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die"" sense of existence."
"It takes 25.3 kilowatt -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water. The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation."
"The car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy. 50 percent of the global population now lives in cities. We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today. We don't compete with airplanes, or cars."
"CNN's John Defterios says people shouldn't sit down in cities. He says the last mile is the problem, and half the world now lives in dense cities. China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half."
"In China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles; 1.7 million used cars. In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities. The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city is their downtowns. We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over?"
"Cities should make it easier for pedestrians to get to and from their cars, says U.S. mayor. ""We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter, and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff,"" he says. ""Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus"""
"""We've been working really, really hard, but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important,"" he says. ""I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want,"" he adds."
"In the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities. Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities. The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals. You do it in your sneakers."
"CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says people are starting to eat like us, and live like us. Gupta: We're harming ourselves around the world, as well as harming the animals. He says we need to spend time with Mother Nature, where there are trees for our good."
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks about the plight of chimpanzees in the developing world. He started a program called Roots and Shoots to raise awareness of the animals' plight. ""Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls"""
"CNN's John Defterios is the host of a new series on CNN.com, ""This Is Life With Defterius"" The series, which premieres tonight at 9pm ET on CNN, focuses on the role of young people in the world."
"Roots and Shoots is already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups. The philosophy is very simple. We do not believe in violence. No violence, no bombs, no guns. That's not the way to solve problems."
"CNN's John Defterios talks to young people in the U.S. about the need for change in the world. He says it's important for young people to learn how to deal with the challenges they face in life. Defterio: ""We can do this. We can make a difference in this world"""
"""We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again,"" says Nelson Mandela. ""If you look back through human history, you see that every evil has been overcome by good,"" he says. ""We are all part of the same human family,"" he adds."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a new series on CNN.com called ""This Is Life"" He says the series will look at how the internet has changed the way we see the world. The series will also look at the impact of technology on the way the world is viewed."
"When he was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker. We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture."
"Chimpanzees are capable of true compassion and altruism. They show emotions, similar to those we feel. They're fighting to develop their own way of living in a world that isn't contaminated. They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about the impact of deforestation in Africa. He says people are losing their homes, livelihoods and livelihoods because of clear-cutting. ""We see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living"""
"""We are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world,"" he says. ""We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future, discuss ideas with each other, so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group"""
"I really believe that the human body is very, very smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do. It's different when a bacteria comes into the body -- that's a foreign object -- we want that out. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched, that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy."
"""It's really an honor and a privilege to be here,"" says Dr. Michael Schubert. Schupert has been studying the effects of heavy metals on the nervous system. He found that they can inhibit the growth of cells in the brain."
"Cancer is a direct result of damage to an organ. The body is trying to repair the damage. Stem cells have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue. It's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't control it."
"Cancer doesn't seem to originate in skeletal muscles, but metastases do. ""It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point. We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix"" ""If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate ... it would be a repair process"""
"Skeletal -- metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare. No one seemed to be asking why. So I decided to ask why. Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle, there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal Muscle."
"Cancer is a complex system -- and there's something called the chemokine network. Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful. When skeletal muscle is injured, that's what causes chemokines, the ""go signs"" for the tumors."
"There are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle. skeletal muscle has a factor in it called ""MyoD"" that causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. MyoD has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to convert this variety of cell types into skeletal Muscle cells."
" Gehry: ""I've been called with at least 100 opportunities -- China, Brazil, other parts of Spain -- to come in and do the Bilbao effect"" ""Some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings,"" Gehry says."
"RSW: ""They just brought us there to hustle this group, you know, to create a project"" RSW: Luckily, I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel. ""I don't have my own plane yet,"" he says."
"Mullis: ""I've never really gone out looking for work. And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff, and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars"" ""It's one of the great dilemmas in creativity: how to do work that's big enough and not."
"When he was 14 his parents bought him a chemistry set and he decided to make water. He bought a tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand I built a house around it. ""I just found out the world ain't going to last that long, this guy was telling us the other day"""
"Every day is a new thing for me. I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did, and I get the sweats, I'm not sure where I'm going, I wouldn't do it. When Bilbao was finished and I saw all the mistakes, I saw ... they weren't mistakes; I saw everything that I would have changed."
"Disney Hall will be finished in 2003 -- September, October -- and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place. Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me. He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time."
"The building was designed by Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza, who is considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture. Siza's early work had a resemblance to the architect's own early work, he says. ""I had an explosion. And the glass -- luckily I turned around -- I had it all in my back and I was about 15 feet away,"" he recalls."
"I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you. I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra, who doesn't think architecture is art. It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together, you play off each other."
"Richard Rogers: ""The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city"" ""If you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other, you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect"""
"""If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work,"" he says. ""It's like gravity. And it's like saying all that, it means your work is good somehow"" ""There wasn't a leak in the building,"" he adds. ""I was clean. I was clean"""
Wright's fame was built on his work in L.A. for a while. Wright is also a software engineer. He is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression. He says he has no plans to return to architecture.
"The artist says he's trying to find a personal way of using the computer. He says the computer makes possible much more than what most people think. The artist's work will be on display at the Whitney Biennial next week, and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea."
"With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine. Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else."
"Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States. These drugs are going generic. They are seeping around the world. I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13."
"""A world without love is a deadly place"" ""I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike"" ""You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do"""
"Researchers have found that mystery elevates dopamine in the brain, pushing you over the threshold to fall in love. You gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems. In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry from all over the world. I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China."
"A man invited a girl to go on a rickshaw ride with him. He figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she'd fall in love with him, he says. The sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner are embedded in the human brain."
"Love is an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally. The motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person. The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team."
"Psychologist says he was ""stunned"" when he learned that love is not an emotion, but a drive. He asked his patients: ""What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"" They replied: ""All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him"""
"Love is one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. W.H. Auden called it an ""intolerable neural itch,"" and indeed, that's what it is. In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system."
"Love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy. Women are moving back into the job market, and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power."
"For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables. With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors, but with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market."
"Women's verbal ability goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak. Even at menstruation, they're better than the average man. ""To have a great writer is to have another government,"" Solzhenitsyn once said."
"Men tend to be more creative. Women tend to have a more linear mind. Men tend to think in terms of the future. Women think about the past. Men think in the present. Women see the past and future. Men see the present and future, women see future."
"Women start sooner at sex, have more partners, express less remorse for the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages in order to get good ones. The 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the ""symmetrical marriage,"" or the ""pure marriage"""
"The older you get, the less likely you are to divorce. The divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline. Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book. It's not easy, because life uses only a subset of the elements."
"Vaccines can't be refrigerated because the ""cold chain"" gets broken. Bruce Rosner found a way to dry out vaccines -- encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells. This is a session about water -- learning about organisms that can do without water."
"Christopher Anderson: ""I came this close to changing species at that moment"" ""We have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life,"" he says. ""That means, you know, net fertility farming,"" Anderson adds."
"Janine Krieg: Life creates conditions conducive to life. Krieg's new book, ""Biomimicry,"" looks at what life might teach us in technology and in design. She says we have to find a way to meet our needs, while making of this place an Eden. ""We want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us, in real time, become inspired,"" she says."
"Researchers are trying to stop the build-up of minerals inside of pipes. They are using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called ""domestication"" ""Domestication is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it,"" he says."
"Al Gore: Engineers realized that the answers to their questions are everywhere. He says they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world. Gore: It's not slavishly mimicking, it's taking the design principles, the genius of the natural world."
"Computer scientists have learned an enormous amount from living things, on the software side. ""How does life make things? This is the opposite; this is how we make things"" ""How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world? More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?"""
Life adds information to matter. It gives it information. And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily. And how does life make things disappear into systems? Because life doesn't really deal in things; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems.
"CNN's John Sutter looks at a process that makes tough ceramics out of seawater. Sutter: Imagine being able to make all of our hard materials that way. The process is being mimicked at Sandia National Labs, he says."
"Scientists are making biodegradable plastics out of CO2. They're also looking at fiber optics, a sea sponge that has a fiber optic. Scientists are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium. They've also seen an enzyme that's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons."
"Water is going to be our big, grand challenge: quenching thirst. Technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms. Separation technologies will be extremely important in the future. The future of the world is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms."
"Technology is about freedom, choices, possibilities, he says. We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference. We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals. That's what technology really wants."
Technology is a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more. All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. That is the infinite game. And what technology is is the medium in which we play that game. It is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are.
"""What does technology want?"" is a question that has been on the minds of scientists for years. ""I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life,"" says Dr. Richard Dawkins. ""We don't really know what life there is on Earth right now"""
"Every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits, you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life. Each one of these organisms that we've described -- what they're doing, each one of them, is they're hacking the rules of life."
"Every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved. fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans. We find life at the bottom of every long-term, long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up. And wherever life is, it never retreats."
"The long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization, complexity and socialization. Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology, or even life. The idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is a cliche."
"Niles Eldredge: Technology is the seventh kingdom of life. He says technology's operations and how it works are so similar to biology that we can think of it as the 7th kingdom. ""When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent,"" he says."
"In 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog, you can buy corn shellers, ploughs, fan mills, stone axes for 50 bucks. In Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters. Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard."
"Technology is changing the way in which ideas are generated, says Neil deGrasse Tyson. The origins of technology were not in 1829, but at the beginning of the Big Bang, he says. ""A finite game is play to win, and an infinite game is played to keep playing,"" Tyson says."
"Psychophysics is about measuring things. Pepsi wanted to know how much aspartame to put in each can of Diet Pepsi. The data doesn't make any sense. It's all over the place. The difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between Coffee that makes you wince, and coffee that make you deliriously happy."
"CNN's John Sutter talks with Howard Kurtz about his work with Nescafé. Kurtz: ""This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science"" ""They were looking for the perfect Pepsi, and they should have been looking for perfect Pepsis,"" Kurtz says."
"Vlasic Pickles, Campbell's Soup and Howard Moskowitz worked together to create Prego. Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù. The quality of the tomato paste is much better. The spice mix is far superior. The sauce adheres to the pasta in a more pleasing way."
"Howard Kurtz's new book is called ""Prego"" Kurtz: ""I was thinking about this, and I realized that although my new book makes me happy, it's not really about happiness"" He says the U.S. has a ""dead tomato society"" and needs to fix it."
"In the early 1980s, you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce. Today, there are seven different kinds of vinegar, and 14 different types of mustard. In six varieties: Cheese, Light, Robusto, Rich &amp; Hearty, Old World Traditional -- Extra-Chunky Garden."
"Ragù and Prego would have focus groups, and they would say, ""What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?"" No one ever said they wanted extra-chunky, Ragù says. ""The mind knows not what the tongue wants,"" Howard says."
"The food industry was obsessed with Grey Poupon in the early 80s. Howard Kurtz: Most of you like milky, weak coffee, but don't say that to someone who asks you what you want. Kurtz says he made the food industry realize the importance of horizontal segmentation."
"""There is no good mustard or bad mustard. There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kind of people"" ""We owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks. He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste"" ""The way to make people happy is to give them something to aspire to"""
"For the longest time in the food industry, there was a sense that there was one way, a perfect way, to make a dish. Chez Panisse's chef has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi. The same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well."
"In the 19th century and much of the 20th, science was obsessed with universals. But that changed in the last 10, 15 years. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability. And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks."
"CNN's John Sutter says blogs are changing the way we read news and consume media. Bloggers are reaching thousands, if not millions, of readers, and that's incredibly important, he says. Sutter: ""I'm a blogger, which, probably, to a lot of you, means different things"""
"CNN's John Sutter writes about his experiences in the news. Sutter: ""I'm a little bit of a mess, but I'm trying to find my way back to the center of the universe"" Sutter's story is based on a true story, he says, about a man who lost his father."

"In science, we keep the whole database, and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number you'd expect by chance. In this case, we tested it. We had two opaque boxes: one with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing. And it got it 50 percent of the time -- which is exactly what you'd Expect with a coin-flip model."

Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge. The publishing process creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books. The first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment. Imagine taking all the world's books and imagine just tearing out the pages.
"Rich Baraniuk: Think of it as a massive iTunes for book-type content. He says anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge, and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content, improve it, play with it, on a timescale of seconds instead of years."
"Connexions' music curriculum is now used over 600,000 times per month. A lot of this use coming from U.S. K-12 schools. The open, extensible nature of this material means it can be used in 84 countries around the world."

XML is a new way to organize content on the web. It's a way to share information among people. It lets people share information in a variety of ways. It is also a way for people to create new music and music-related content.
The new e-texts will let students explore and experiment with math and music. They will be able to rip or copy musical ideas and use them in innovative ways. The e-books will be available in the U.S. and Europe.
"The music industry is owned by big industries, so we can't let piracy happen here. The key is to find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe and understandable. The inspiration here is taken from open-source software, like Linux and the Creative Commons licenses."
"Creative Commons is taking off -- over 43 million things out there, licensed with a Creative Commons license. Not just text, but music, images, video. There's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free."

"The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very, very rich. They were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came. The same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s are still running the major gang in Chicago today."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about what he learned from the study of the gang. Sutter: Some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy worked very good in the drug economy. He says the gang member says it much more articulately than the economist, about what's going on."
"CNN's John Sutter spoke with a gang member about how crack cocaine transformed the gang. Sutter: ""The gang leader always got paid. No matter how bad it was economically, he always got himself paid"" ""If you start taking losses, they see you as weak and shit,"" the gang member said."
"In the early '80s, gang leaders in the inner city had no way to make money. They couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang, because they didn't have money. The gang members didn't know any rich white people, so couldn't sell to that market."
"Crack cocaine was a brilliant way of getting the brain high. It was a perfect drug; you could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar, sell it for five dollars. It created a wonderful market. For the people who were there running the gang, it was a great way, seemingly, to make a lot of money."
"Sudhir was a math major in college who had a good heart. He decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD, came to the University of Chicago. Three months before he came to Chicago, he had spent following the Grateful Dead. He was really a curious sight to be seen."

"Sudhir: The thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees. The guys who are running the local gangs -- the four-square-block areas -- they're just like the guys, in some sense, who're running the McDonald's."
"Selling drugs for a gang is perhaps the worst job in all of America, he says. The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 an hour. The most talented individuals in these communities weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways."
"The death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year. It's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street. To put it into perspective: if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq, for instance, right now fighting the war: 0.5 percent."
"In the 1980s, young black men in the U.S. were living in a war zone. They were selling drugs for $3.50 an hour, with a 25 percent chance of dying. The gang was a rite of passage; that as you got older, you dropped out of the gang."
"Levitt: Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury? Levitt: In my data, and in another data set I've looked at for New Jersey crashes, I find very small differences in injury."
"Inventor came up with a partial cure for a disease that killed the most children. He found that the expensive, complicated solution was no better than the cheap one. The U.S. keeps a data set of every fatal accident that's happened since 1975."
"The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's website shows how many children die in car crashes when they're unrestrained. The data shows that when a child is unrestrained in a crash, 18.2 percent of the children die. If they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, 19.4 percent die, and 16.7 percent die if they're in a car seat."
"In recent crashes the lap-and-shoulder seatbelts are doing even better than the car seats. The new car seats are far, far better, says Dr. Michael Schumacher. The government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much, he says."
"CNN's John Sutter takes a look at a car seat crash test. The car seat is attached to a dummy, and the dummy is thrown around. Sutter: ""It's hard to believe, when you look at this, that that kid in back is going to do very well"""
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the impact of seatbelts on children in car crashes. Sutter: ""It's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong, which is putting children at risk"" Sutter says the car seats aren't doing much to protect children in a crash."
"The idea of using real-world crashes is something that economists think would be the right thing to do. The answer to why has a car seat been so successful, and why this may someday be adopted or not, lies in a story."
"The Hooper Bank is a project of connecting typology, the traditional buildings, and morphology. The building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing, but something that's only inextricably connected to this city and this place.

"Architecture is the beginning of something, if you're not involved in first principles. And so, in the formation of things, in giving it form, it starts with some notion of how one organizes. And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities."
"Architecture is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it, says Pritzker. ""As the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex processes,"" he says. ""And that directly connects to ideas of city-making"""
"Dine: ""I work with more or less inert matter. ... It's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character"" ""It made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things,"" says Dine. ""It allows us for a very different notion of what a building is"""
"The project is part of a sign system that was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles. The skin of the building drapes over and differentiates from the body. As it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it and bends up."
"Michael Heizer: I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it. Heizer's work is a negotiation between one's private world, one's conceptual world, the world of ideas. The skin of the sculptures forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind. It adjusts continually."

"""I want the rules to be as loose as possible,"" he says. ""This is not about money. This is about people's lives,"" he adds. ""I don't want people to be afraid to do what they have to do to get ahead"""
"The U.S. has to access that battle space instantaneously. Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly. We say, ""China, it's yours."" Prometheus approach, largely a geographic definition, focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict."
"There is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access, he says. ""We can run the score up against anybody, and then get our asses kicked in the second half,"" he adds. ""It's about non-lethal technologies, because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you're going to lose friends very quickly"""
" Barnett: ""This is not about projecting power, but about staying power, which is about legitimacy with the locals"" ""We lucked out, frankly, on the selection. We have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. But we have trouble accessing our outcomes,"" he says."
"""We do it better than anybody and we still suck at it,"" he says. ""What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else"" ""It's the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan, OK? We argue about it every time we use it. They got out on the far end, we said, ""Fine, don't worry about it."""
"The U.N. Security Council is a grand jury, he says. The U.S.-enabled Leviathan Force is a force that says, ""You want me to take that guy down? I'll do it on Tuesday"" The system is transparent and gives the sense of a non-zero outcome, he adds."
"Powell: We haven't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas, he says. Powell: We use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we're a democracy and that's what it takes."
"The U.S. should have had 250,000 troops streaming into Iraq on the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad, he says. What we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what I call that Sys Admin Force, he adds."
"The U.S. Defense Department is considering a new national security strategy. The new plan would see money spent on national security, rather than on security-related activities. This is the first step in a process that could lead to the creation of a national security council."
The U.S. military is split between those who see a future they can live with and those who fear a future that starts to scare them. Most of the military got dragged down into the muck across the 1990s and they developed this derisive term to describe it: military operations other than war.

"Paldin is a 62-year-old monk. He spent 33 years in prison. His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising. And he was beaten, starved, tortured -- lost all his teeth. He was a kind gentle old man."
Dalai Lama was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two. He was installed as the 14th Dalai Lama when he was a teenager. He's never been back to his country since. He is still sticking to this non-violent response to a severe political and human rights issue.

"CNN's John Sutter shows off some of the work he's done with indigenous people in India. Sutter: ""I wanted to give indigenous people a voice"" He also shows off a film that a student made in Guatemala in the wake of a landslide."
"Wigler: All of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one. He says if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene, maybe we'll feel sick. The first disease he looked at is autism, and the reason he did it is we had the money to do it."
"Scientists have found that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia. 30 percent of schizophrenic people are left- handed, and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics. The study will cost at least 10 to 20 million dollars, and will help parents of autistic children."
"At the University of Chicago he was a zoology major, and thought he would get a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology. Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called ""What is Life?"" by the great physicist, Schrodinger. And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know."
"Chris Hadfield: ""I got the impression that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA"" Hadfield worked with Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England. Hadfield says DNA had a structure, even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions. He says there was something universal about the DNA molecule."
"Francis Crick: I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23. Within a day, we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA. And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it."
"Peter Pauling's son, who was in Cambridge, said his father was now working on DNA. ""I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped,"" Pauling says. Pauling proposed a three-stranded structure, and he proposed a new way to study DNA."
"""I'm going to tell you what I want to do with my life,"" he says. ""I want to live in a world where I can do anything I want."" ""I don't want to go back to a time when I couldn't do anything,"" he adds. ""When I was a kid, I wanted to be able to do anything."""
"""We knew it was big because, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it, because you didn't have any other scheme,"" he says. ""We saw how genetic information is carried. It's the order of the four bases"" ""It is a sort of digital-type information. And you copy it by going from strand-separating"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his work on the structure of RNA. Sutter: ""It was really, you know, sort of a mystery to me"" Sutter says he and a group of scientists spent years trying to solve the mystery."
"The first cracking of the genetic code was done by Marshall Nirenberg in 1966. DNA didn't become a useful molecule until 1973, 20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen patented their method of recombinant DNA. ""I didn't really get happy until 1960, because then we found out, basically, you know, that there are three forms of RNA,"" he says."
"The technique is similar to that used in DNA sequencing. It can be used to test DNA for cancer. Scientists hope to use it to test the DNA of prostate cancer patients. The technique could also be used for HIV/AIDS patients, among other things."

"CNN's John Defterios talks to Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia. He says the site is being used to help people understand the world around them. He also talks about a new project, the Wikibooks, which aims to make it easier to teach languages."
"The Wikibooks project is an effort to do that. It's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition. The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French. Only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia."
 Wikipedia is a top-50 website and is more popular than the New York Times. The servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. The way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine.
"""We're doing around 1.4 billion page views a month"" ""We could never afford to do this all the time"" ""It's not like we're in a war zone, we're not in danger of being attacked"" ""There's no danger of us being in a conflict zone"""
"CNN's John Defterios says he doesn't think the U.S. is ready for a ""post-9/11"" world. He says it's time to take back control of the internet. Defterio: ""We need to make sure that we don't lose the ability to communicate"""
CNN.com is a non-profit news agency based in the U.S. It was set up in 2007 to provide news coverage of events in the news. CNN.com has been in touch with the group to discuss its plans for future.
"Only about 18 percent of all edits to the website are done by anonymous users. Wikipedia is written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality."
"It's written using wiki software, so anyone can quickly edit and save it. The tools and the software allow us to self-monitor and to monitor all the work. The type of people who write an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people."
"The Votes For Deletion page allows people to vote on whether to delete a piece of information. The vote is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue. The votes are just text typed into a page. Yochai: ""It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point for quick research"""
" Wikipedia administrators are elected by the community. They have the right to delete pages, but must follow all the rules. ""There's a certain amount of aristocracy,"" says Wikipedian RickK. ""It's a tight-knit community,"" he says."
"""I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge,"" he says. ""We don't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes"" ""There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices"""
"Computer scientists can see inside the human brain for the first time. The resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. E-commerce has been growing exponentially and is now a trillion dollars. We will succeed in reverse-engineering the brain by the 2020s, he says."
"By 2010 computers will disappear, he says. They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment. Images will be written directly to our retina, providing full-immersion virtual reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities."
"Nano-bots will be able to shut down the signals coming from your real senses, replacing them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment. They'll also go inside our brain, interact with our biological neurons. The technology will be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology."
"Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology. That's been a strong interest of mine, and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years. Most inventions fail, not because the R&amp;D department can't get it to work. There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance."
"It took us 15 years to sequence HIV -- we sequenced SARS in 31 days. The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas, is doubling every decade, according to our models. If we could convert 0.03 percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy, we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030."
The first step in evolution was the development of the human body. The next step was the evolution of the technology to make the body more powerful. This process has been going on for thousands of years. The latest generation of technology has made this process even faster.
"Theory of Moore's Law is based on the idea that all transistors will grow at the same rate. In fact, the rate of growth of transistors is much faster than the rate at which they can be shrunk. This is because transistors can't be made to grow faster than they already are."
"In 1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar. You could buy 10 million in 2002. Nano-engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it's needed. We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam."
"We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last 50 years. The price performance makes new applications feasible, new applications come to the market. A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology in these information terms."
"Biotechnology is changing the way we live, says U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. New forms of gene therapy overcome the problem of placing genetic material in the right place on the chromosome. Miniaturization -- we're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate."
"Robotic red blood cells could be used to perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions. Rob Freitas: ""Our biology is actually very sub-optimal, even though it's remarkable in its intricacy"" In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region, there were 500 million people living in poverty. That number is under 200 million."
"The main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging. It's got to be long-lived molecules. If a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone."
"AG: Aging kills considerably more people than malaria does. There's a proposal to actually put together an institute. It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech. But it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this."
"Aging is not a product of selection, evolution; [aging] is simply aProduct of evolutionary neglect. In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging. You need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly."
"Aging is not just about getting frail and miserable, it's about healthy life, he says. ""There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about,"" he adds. ""But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion"""
"The risks of doing something about aging outweigh the downside of leaving aging as it is, he says. We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate, he adds. ""The pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks"""
"Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds. It's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that. Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars, and it also happens to us."
"The ""gerontology approach"" and the ""geriatrics approach"" are two ways of postponing aging. The geriatrician will intervene late in the day, when pathology is becoming evident. The ""geriatrician"" will try and hold back the sands of time, and stop the accumulation of side effects."
"How long would it take for people of various ages today to live 30 years longer? We can't just say, ""Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 Years longer"" That's the wrong answer. The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore. This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough."
"The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us, he says. The therapies will never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200- year-olds."
"The first person to live to 1,000 is probably only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old. ""Robust human rejuvenation"" is equivalent to adding two years to the life of a mouse. ""Longevity escape velocity"" is the point at which people can live for 30 years without dying."
"The first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer. We have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation. The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are."
"The damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born. Gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage. The engineering approach simply says, ""Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage"""
"We don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born. The point about this slide is actually the bottom. If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night."
"Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force. Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed into more complex forms. Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate."
"Five years ago, I went on a personal journey. I wanted to visualize the story of life. It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted, and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out. It grew as light and oxygen increased. It learned to move and began to see."
"Life began on Earth three billion years ago. In Africa, the first plants were born. In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree, and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword. Today, life continues to grow and spread."
"When the skies cleared, a new world was born. From tiny shrews [came] tenrecs, accustomed to the dark. New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still. The first living things to capture photosynthesis -- and the only place they still occur today."
"The whole animal world lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae. Their waste is our breath, and vice versa. The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth. And our brains -- our celebrated brains -- reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh."
"""This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane. We call it ""atmosphere"" This is the icon of our journey. And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next"" ""If it comes out six months late, so what? That's a pretty soft landing"""
Seymour Papert: Computers have made learning more like walking and talking. He says learning is driven by the learner himself or herself. Papert has been at MIT for 44 years. He has worked with developing countries to bring computers to children.
"One Laptop Per Child is a program that uses computers to teach kids to read and write. The program was started in 2002 by a group of parents and teachers in Maine. It's now in its third year, and the program has seen a big increase in participation."
"It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards. The idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down. We will not launch this without five to 10 million units in the first run."
"Laptop economics are the following: 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales, marketing, distribution and profit. The display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch. That can drop to eight; it's not going to drop to two, or to one and a half, unless we do some pretty clever things."
The One Laptop Per Child is a mesh network of laptops. The idea is to have a display that both works outdoors. You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits. The network will be available in the U.S. and Europe.
"When it's backlit, it's color. When it's frontlit, It's black and white at three times the resolution. And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen. And in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works."
"The $100 laptop could transform into an electronic book. The games buttons are missing, but it'll also be a games machine, book machine. It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say, ""Let's do it at the state level,"" because states are more nimble."
"""We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. The gray market's a big issue. We're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down. So many things hit the market at a price and then drift up. So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010"""

"The Big Bang created the universe, but we still don't know what caused it. In a new simulation, we see how the universe has expanded over time. We also see the formation of planets, stars and galaxies in the universe. The Big Bang is still a mystery, but the universe is getting closer."
"Until we have a theory that unifies the very large and the very small, we don't yet have a unified theory. One idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space. And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe."
"""We are midway between atoms and stars,"" says Sir Ken Robinson. ""We have to be large, compared to atoms, to have layer upon layer of complex structure,"" he says. ""And it's this that is changing our world faster than ever,"" he adds."
"In this century, not only has science changed the world faster than ever, but in new and different ways. Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence, perhaps even implants into our brains, may change human beings themselves. Human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming, mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented."
"We have to accept that there will be hazards to science, says Dr. Richard Branson. Branson: ""We need not just physicists, but we need biologists, computer experts and environmentalists"" He says scientists need to be able to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed."
"The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years, but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out. The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond. We are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond."
"Over nearly all that immense time, Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually. But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history, the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. Within just 50 years, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise, and ominously fast."
"The film was commissioned by a large healthcare system in Minnesota. The first thing Ideo shared with them was this. The point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof. That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital."
"Bauer Bodoni: ""It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do. It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference"" The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling. ""I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator"""
"CNN's John Defterios looks at some of the ideas that have come out of the recent U.S. election. He says the idea of seeing things for the first time is a common one. Defterio: ""Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges, is often a really interesting place to start"""
"CNN's John Defterios looks at the ways in which people use their peripheral vision to find opportunities. Defterio: ""We use this phrase ""workarounds"" a lot, sort of, looking around us"" He says the idea that a tiny human gesture dictates the design of a product is important."

"I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem. I just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general, and aging, in particular."
The Library of Congress holds 18 million volumes. It is estimated that 52 million people will die each year. This is the equivalent of three libraries a year being burned down. The Library is one of the most important places in the world for learning.
There seems to be a consensus that the risk of human extinction is substantial. Even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number. If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe -- the Virgo supercluster -- maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there.
"It's difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best. The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be. Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers, which is encouraging."
"Human nature would have to change if we want to change the world, he says. Growth hormone therapy, Adderall, anti-depressants don't really transform what it is to be human, he adds. ""We might end up with something like this, which is a heck of a lot better than that,"" he writes."
" Cognitive enhancers, such as brain reprogramming techniques, have been used since time immemorial. ""We don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets, but even institutions and techniques,"" he says. ""Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature"""
"The human mind has a lot of different, special, evolved modules that do specific things for us. Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have. We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it."

"No precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee. We need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance. An ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure, but that's only if we know what to prevent."
"The universe is not a typical place, according to the author. To get to the typical place in the universe, you've got to go 1,000 times as far as intergalactic space. The universe is full of stars, not walls and chemical scum, but no galaxies."
"TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space. It's so dark, that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer. That's how big and how dark the universe is."
"Quasars originally meant ""quasi-stellar object,"" which means ""things that look a bit like stars"" Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a supermassive black hole. The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other."
Physicists believe that the solar system is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality. The fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world.
"In the universe, there is no need to build a new planet. Instead, we could build a self-contained space station. There, we would be able to learn about the universe from a new vantage point. This would take several hundred million years."
"Intergalactic space contains all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge. Any cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are. The limiting factor, there and here, is not resources -- because they're plentiful -- but knowledge."
"The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history. The one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others is our special relationship with the laws of physics. The actions that are advocated are not purported to solve the problem, merely to postpone it by a little."
"This is a pretty interesting trend, because we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly, ""Form follows function,"" but I think I've sort of grown up in that world. I spent six years thinking about that, but to show you the power of art over science -- this is actually one of the cartoons I write."
"The secret to biology is, it builds computation into the way it makes things, he says. ""We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way,"" he adds. ""Can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems?"" he asks."
"Lionel Penrose worked on the idea in the '60s. The idea is to make a linear string that can be folded into a 3D structure. In a neutral state, the strings won't bind at all, but they can be made to do so."
"Neil Gershenfeld: ""You don't need digital logic to do computation"" ""I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence"" ""The universe is now a compiler,"" he says."
"Researchers have developed a way to make lenses that can cover the range of human refractive error, from minus 12 to plus eight diopters. The lenses can be made by pouring on a monomer and then applying pressure. They can then reverse the pressure on the monomer to pop the lens out."
"Lisa Randall: How can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things, so you end up with this sort of guy? Randall: Lego in the '70s nailed this, and they did it most elegantly. But they can show you how to build things in sequence. Randall: Unless Lisa Randall changes that, we'll continue to move in linear time."
"Bill Joy: We need to rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things. Joy: How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas, and see the world in a different way? Joy: It's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it's sort of an analog computer."

"CNN's John Defterios looks at some of the happiest moments of his life. He recalls a moment when his brother gave him his first Walkman. He also recalls a time when he and a friend went on a bike ride. Defterius: ""It was a great experience"""
"The Mori Museum opened in Tokyo last November. The inaugural exhibit was called ""Happiness"" The exhibit was divided into four different areas. The theory was that if you abstract an image, you open as much room for the un-representable."
"""Happy"" has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost have to do it from a cynical point of view. A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog. It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne. Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face."

"Military science and technology can create an advanced materials-industrial cluster, he says. ""We are the Saudi Arabia of ""nega-barrels,"" he adds. ""Ours is on the demand side. We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil"""
"In 1850, one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling. In 1859, at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared. The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit-maximizing capitalists."
"U.S. faces competition from Europe, Korea, and next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars. Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil, or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars? That seems to make more sense."
"The U.S. can save half the oil by using it more efficiently, at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel. The other half can be replaced with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas. In the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural."
"In the U.S. only about one-third of the fuel in a car goes to the car's engine. The rest is used to heat the car, or to make it go faster. In Europe, the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks is about the same, but it's much lower."
"Less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver. Carbon-fiber composites could absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel. If this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour, the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-f fiber cones."
"We could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light. The U.S. can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time. It's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it."
"The U.S. needs 28 million barrels of oil a day by 2025, the government says. About eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then. Another seven can be saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel."
"The plan would make it possible for low-income families to get efficient, reliable cars. The government would also scrap almost one clunker, preferably the dirtiest ones. This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit from customers they wouldn't get otherwise."

"In the '40s and '50s, the South Bronx was largely a white, working-class neighborhood. The area was razed to make way for new development in the city. The exodus left many families without a home or a way to get around."
"The first phase of a plan to build a bike path in the South Bronx is complete. The second phase of the project will be completed by the end of the year. The project is funded by a federal grant, and the third phase will be funded by private donations."
"The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere."
LZ Granderson: We need to do more to help the people of New York City. He says the city's problems are the result of a lack of political will to solve them. Granderson says we need to work together to make the city a better place.
"Developments in the South Bronx have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned. But New York City is operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit. There is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space."
"The mayor of Bogota, Colombia, has a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. Enrique Peñalosa's administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas."
"Bogota's people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, he says. The city's development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population, he adds. ""This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal,"" Obama says."
The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 -- that's how old I am. One billion people live in abject poverty. Four billion live in growing but fragile economies. One in seven live in unplanned settlements.
"The project is the first of its kind in the world. It aims to be a link between the design world and the developing world. The project has raised more than $100,000 in donations so far. The first phase of the project is set to be completed by the end of 2014."
The Worldchanging CEO wants to create a community where ideas can be tested in austere environments. He wants everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development. The idea of needs-based competitions -- XPRIZE for the other 98 percent -- is part of the plan.

Housing project in Kosovo is one of the first of its kind in the world. The project aims to build homes for people who have lost their homes. It also aims to create communities through complex networks of housing and infrastructure. The program is funded by the U.S. State Department.
"Within three days, we realized the problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS. We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month."
"The project is based on the idea of a community health center. The center would be a place for young women to learn about HIV/AIDS. The project is now being rolled out in Nigeria and Kenya, with plans to expand it to the rest of Africa."

"CNN's John Defterios traveled to China to document the country's growing economy. He visited the Baosteel steel factory, where 15,000 workers are building a sixth blast furnace. He also went to a factory where 400 workers worked 10 hours a day, picking out one of the fastest."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to the Philippines to document the construction of a new silk factory. The factory is using state-of-the-art technology, but the workers are still hard at work. Defterio: ""It was just lightning fast; the way she was working was almost unbelievable"""
"The factory where Nike and Adidas make shoes is one of the biggest in China. It was hard to get into the international companies because they had to get permission from them. The mobile phone industry in China is booming, with many new companies popping up every week."

 NeuroPace is developing a portable device for treating migraine headaches. The company is also developing a device to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. The group also wants to improve health care in the U.S. by reducing malpractice litigation.
"The winner of a 100,000-dollar prize for best TED Talk says he has three wishes. He says he wants to see a better treatment for migraines and a better way to deal with medical malpractice. He also wants to raise awareness of the high cost of health care in the U.S."
"The patient or spouse must read and sign 12 pages of informed consent. A video could be made showing the anatomy and procedure done with animation. The patient could also agree not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs. In America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury."
"A computer could detect a heart attack in a person before they even have symptoms. The device could save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the U.S. The FDA won't just let us use them on people unless we try it out first, he says."
"Computer can detect a heart attack before it happens, says Dr. Tim Fischell. The device is the size of a pacemaker and can run for five years without needing replacement. The EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table. It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room."
"The FDA tested a new heart device on an animal, a pig. The pig had a heart attack. The device could have saved the pig's life. The FDA has approved the device for use in the U.S. and other countries."
"It takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient. 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously. The Implanted AngelMed Guardian sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device."
"Migraine is preceded by a visual aura, and this visual aura begins with little dancing lights. The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain. The AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction, is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money."
"30 million Americans suffer from migraines, with 300,000 people dying each year. Researchers in Ohio are testing a portable magnetic zapper. The device creates a magnetic field to counteract electrical activity in the brain. It may look silly or frightening as you walk around with it in your purse, but researchers say it is scientifically sound."
"30 million Americans have migraine headaches, and we need a means to treat it, says Robert Fischell. The research has actually been around for more than a decade, and more long-term studies need to be done. Researchers hope to present their studies to the FDA this summer."

"Smallpox was the worst disease in history, killing more people than all the wars in history. The key to eradicating smallpox was early detection, early response. This little girl is Rahima Banu, and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world."
"In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin were born, two million people died of smallpox. In the last century, it killed 500 million people. We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980. But to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective."
"In 1967, the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate smallpox. In 1974, India was the place where smallpox made its last stand. In that year, there were 34 countries affected with smallpox; by 1970, we were down to 18 countries."
"In India alone, my 150,000 best friends and I went door to door, with that same picture, to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls. Every time we did a house-to-house search, we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox."
The world needs more people who are willing to give up their lives for the good of others. The world needs people who want to make a difference in the lives of those who are less fortunate than they are. We need more people willing to take on the challenge of giving up their own lives for others.
The Seva Foundation has given back sight to more than two million people in 15 countries. It is the first time in history that blindness has been treated as a public health issue. The foundation's first project was to find the cause of blindness in Nepal in the 1970s.
The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response. Fifteen percent of flu experts said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years. 90 percent said there would be a Pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime.
"If there was a pandemic, a billion people would get sick. As many as 165 million people would die. There would be a global recession and depression. The cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse than 100 million people dying."

"Americans, like Irish people, are good at it. Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford. We like to give, and we give a lot. But justice is a tougher standard than charity. There is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa and conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else."

"In 1854, a five-month-old girl contracted cholera at 40 Broad Street in Soho, London. 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days, and much more would have died if people hadn't fled after the initial outbreak kicked in."
"In 1854, London was hit by an outbreak of cholera. The outbreak was concentrated around a single point source: a water pump. Local minister Henry Whitehead tracked down cases of people who had drunk water from the pump. Whitehead also made a map of the outbreak to show the extent of the problem."
"In 1854, 10 percent of London's population died of cholera. London was the largest city on the face of the planet at the time. The map's legacy is that it made the idea of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one."
"CNN's John Defterios asks people to think about the world's biggest problems. He asks them to write down what they think should be the top and bottom priorities. Defterio: ""What should be at the bottom of the list? What should be top?"""
The U.N. has never made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world. One reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable. There are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there are number ones.
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a series of stories on climate change. This is the third in a series on the topic. Defterio: ""We are trying to find a way to make climate change a reality for all of us"""
"Climate change was at the bottom of the list of projects to invest in. ""I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects,"" he says. ""This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back, either"""
"Climate change is a big problem, but what we can do about it is very little, at a very high cost. Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year. That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at some of the world's most pressing issues. He says there are more than two billion people in need of clean water. The world needs to invest more in water and sanitation, he says. Defterio: ""We need to make sure that we don't just spend money on things that don't work"""
"The U.S. and Europe need to do more to fight HIV/AIDS and malnutrition, he says. ""We could pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty in about two to five years,"" he adds. ""That would be the second best thing we could do"""
"In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't. Treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention. We can do X amount of good in treatment, and 10 times as much good in prevention. And what I want to make sure of is, that we focus on the right ones."
"In 100 years, when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be, people will be much, much richer. Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N. estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today. Do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little, 100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?"
"CNN's John Defterios asks: ""Is this really the right list that we got out?"" Defterio: ""It's not about making things that have the most media attention. It's about making places where we can actually do the most good"""

"Every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. At the top are mathematics and languages, at the bottom are the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system that teaches dance every day to children."
"I like university professors, but we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future."
"Academics look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads, he says. Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability, he adds. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century."

"After Sally Clark was convicted, an expert said the chance that she was innocent was one in 73 million. That's a logical error. It's exactly the same logical error as thinking that after the disease test, which is 99 percent accurate, the chance of having the disease is 99 per cent."

"Most people think that, on average, it'll take longer to see head-tail-head than head- tail-tail. Even rather distinguished mathematicians think that A is true here. But the average number of tosses until head- Tail-Head is 10 is the same as for head Tail- Tail."
"A coin toss is a bit like a game of Monopoly. If you get a head, you celebrate. If it's a tail, you put the champagne away. If the coin comes down a head again, you're disappointed. But if it comes down head-tail, you get really excited."

"Sally Clark, who had two babies who died suddenly, was charged with murder. A distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths, innocent deaths, in a family like hers -- which was professional and non-smoking -- was one in 73 million. Clark was convicted at the time and later acquitted on appeal."
"The chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly. The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us, is to get them to quit hating us.

"Scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution. Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with. By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human, scientists are documenting their development."
"Kanzi uses both hands to strike rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other. He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows, he can make much larger, sharper flakes. The rock is from Gona, Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors."
The apes use a geometric language to communicate. The language permeates their entire life. They speak when she touches them. A frame represents a hut in the woods. They talk to each other when they want to. They communicate by writing on a chalkboard.
"Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said, by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk. The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world. Researchers found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is to use language around them."
"Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment, which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities. Dr. Sue: There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there's something very, very special about man."

"Mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system. They use what's called a ""catch mechanism,"" or ""click mechanism,"" to move their limbs. The mechanism takes a long time for the muscle to contract, and a very short time for a limb to fly out."
"The National Museum of Natural History is home to one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. The shrimp have a saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. The structure looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse, and it's surrounded by membranous areas."
"Saddle-shaped structure is also known as a ""hyperbolic paraboloid surface"" It has curves in two directions, so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces. It's a very strong surface, which is why it's used to build roofs."
"Mantis shrimp, or stomatopods, make sound with their appendages. Scientists used shrimp paste to measure the force of mantis shrimp in a load cell. The animals overloaded the load cell and created huge amounts of force. Scientists believe this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given -- per body mass."
"Sheila Patek: Mantis shrimp are called ""mantis shrimp"" after the praying mantises, which also have a fast feeding appendage. She says the first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell. But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later, and I didn't know what that was, she says."
"The images were taken at 20,000 frames per second. They show the impact of two different types of force on the snail. The first is the force of the limb hitting the load cell, the second is the collapse of the cavitation bubble. The images were captured by the BBC."
"Lionel says mantis shrimp are known for bluffing when they can't strike. He says the colored dots in the center of the saddles of stomatopods could be a sign of their ability to strike. ""It's an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring"""
"CNN's John Sutter asks viewers to test their perception of images. Images can violate expectations about shape, color and texture, Sutter says. Sutter: Women can consistently do better than males in matching which head to look at. He says design mistakes can be made that incorporate illusions."
"CNN's John Sutter shows off some of his favorite illusions. Sutter: ""There's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe, where citizens were empowered by technologies"" ""I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness,"" Sutter says."
"Economic development is of the people and by the people, for the people. The World Bank is an organization of the government, by the government. If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive, so that their voices are heard, then things would improve."
"""The Economist"" recognized this, but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago, and that's what I've been working on. Of course, how would you empower citizens? There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones,"" he says."
"The cost of installing a new telephone in Bangladesh was 2,000 dollars. The impact of one new telephone, which is on the vertical axis, is very little. But if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is, let's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars, then the impact is huge."
"CNN's Richard Quest asks why we don't have enough telephones in the U.S. Quest: ""Why do we have to worry about that? Why do we need to have a phone?"" Quest: We need to be able to connect with each other and work together."
"In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service, but very few of us are trying to buy a bank. So we could do that for telephones. And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet: food, clothing, shelter."
"The project was inspired by the country's lack of cell phone networks. ""I thought I could put cell towers and create a network,"" he says. ""It's a little crazy, but logical,"" he adds. ""There is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs"""
"Gonofone is serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people. The phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company. Two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year. The company is also investing around another 300 million dollars this year to extend that coverage."
"In 2004, the net profit, after taxes -- very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars. The company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers. The government needs to provide economically viable services. The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."

"After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia, I began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization. I spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident. The rural poor had become the urban poor, and in the process, they'd become invisible."
"In 2000, I began documenting global health issues, concentrating first on AIDS in Africa. I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers. I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped, whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations."
More than half of children in the U.S. die before they reach the age of five. Less than one-tenth of those who die are treated for the disease. More than a third of the children who die have no access to health care.

The Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool. It collaborates with you to create sort of a post-war German etching. No one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back. It all started back in 2001.
"The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea, and to reach it you've got to ski literally over the frozen crust, the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean. ""No one else is the authority on your potential. You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of,"" he says."
"We had less than two hours two-way communication with the outside world in two months. We'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left to go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time. And I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly."
The first solo circumnavigation of the Arctic Ocean has never been done by a man alone. The journey took more than three years to complete. The expedition was funded by a crowd-funding page on the internet. It was the first time a man has attempted such a long journey alone.
"CNN's Richard Quest was stuck in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, for 10 days. He was the only human being in an area one-and-a-half times the size of America. Quest: ""I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world, but you can see it from there"""
"Only four people have skied solo to the North Pole. NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began. The ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean, the wind and the tides."
"I knew the Artic was warming. I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve. This was my little bit of bio-mimicry. I think the reason for that is that it's -- it's well, it's as Chris said, bonkers."
"In 2001, we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world. I skied the equivalent of 31 marathons back to back. It took me 68 days to get there from Russia, and there is nothing there. There isn't even a pole at the Pole."
CNN's Ben Poynter skied for a week past the Pole. He was forced to abandon his skis because of dangerous conditions. He recorded his experiences on his satellite phone. He also wrote a video diary of his experience.
"The expedition manager told Ben to find 500 meters of flat, thick safe ice. The only bit of ice he could find was exactly 473 meters. The pilot, he knew, was called Troy. The co-pilot was a lady called Monica. They were the least macho people I've ever met."
"The South Pole is a big scientific base with an airstrip, cafe and tourist shop. At minus 40, exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute, so how do you answer the call of nature? ""I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense. I'm not skiing along drawing maps"""

"CNN's John Defterios says the world is in need of a new way of looking at the world. He says we need to look at how we can make the world a better place. We need to make it more sustainable, he says, and less dependent on natural resources."
"In India, where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than two dollars a day, the land is extraordinarily parched. You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar. The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions if you give them that opportunity."
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks about the need for malaria bed nets in Africa. He says they can save lives, but there are a lot of hurdles to getting them to Africa. ""We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars,"" he says."
"CNN's John Sutter meets a woman who is helping to build the world's first women's factory. The factory in Tanzania is set to be completed by the end of the year. Sutter: ""We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa"""
"CNN's John Sutter says there's an enormous opportunity to make poverty history. Sutter: We have to build business models that matter, that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians, people all over the developing world. ""It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,"" he says."
"The data is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. One of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tools to animate it there. The new head of UN statistics doesn't say it's impossible. He only says, ""We can't do it."""
"Swedish top students know significantly less about the world than chimpanzees. The number of internet users are going up like this. It's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. It will be very interesting to follow this over the year."
"The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas. I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, which hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there. Because the chimpanzees would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey."
"In 1962, there was a group of countries that had small families and long lives. In the '80s, Bangladesh started promoting family planning, and they moved up into that corner. Now, all the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families."
"Vietnam had small families and long life; America had large families and short lives. By the end of the year, family planning started in Vietnam, and they went for smaller families. And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy. This is the world distribution of income of people."
"The richest 20 percent of the world's population take 74 percent of its annual income. The poorest 20 percent take about two percent. The concept of developing countries is ""extremely doubtful,"" says Karolinska Institute's head of medicine. The world has everything from the poorest in Africa to the richest in Latin America."
"The World Bank says the world will not have a divided world. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70%. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money."
"Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their textiles. There's a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Data is often better than you think, but we can see the difference in Cambodia and Singapore."
"In 1960, Mao Zedong brought health to China. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. In each pair of countries, one has twice the child mortality of the other. South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower. It seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first."
"In spite of falling oil prices, Sheikh Zayed brought this country up here. The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on a regional level."

"phthalmologist Steve Levitt: ""Some choice is better than none. But it doesn't follow from that that more choice isbetter than some choice"" Levitt says Western societies have too much choice, not too little. He says the net result is that we do better in general, objectively, and we feel worse."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the impact of too many choices on society. Sutter: ""If you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom"" He says that by giving people too many options, they actually make themselves worse off."
"In a single consumer electronics store, there are six and a half million different stereo systems. We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones. The absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery."
"In the U.S., it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do. We call it ""patient autonomy,"" which makes it sound like a good thing, but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from the doctor to the patient."
"The only real choice was who, not when, and not what you did after. We are blessed, as Carl was pointing out, with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet. The official dogma of all Western industrial societies is to work."
"The world we used to live in looked like this. That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice. With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all. For every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down."
"The more options we have, the less satisfaction we get from our decisions. The more options, the more likely we are to regret our choices. This is why it's important to have more choices, not less, in the world we live in."
"The more options we have, the less satisfaction we get from what we do. The way to maximize your options is to make sure you choose wisely. The more choices you make, the more likely you are to make the wrong ones. The less satisfaction you get from your choices, the fewer opportunities you have to do something else."
"The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more welfare they have. The more options there are, the less satisfaction people have with results, he says. ""I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself,"" he writes. ""The reason is -- I felt worse"""
"The secret to happiness is: low expectations, he says. The best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. People have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high."

"A year after losing the use of their legs and a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives. Human beings have something that we might think of as a ""psychological immune system"" A recent study suggests that if it happened over three months ago, with only a few exceptions, it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness."
"In two million years, the human brain has nearly tripled in mass. We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found. You don't have to look very far for evidence. I took a copy of the ""New York Times"" to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness."

"The prefrontal cortex does lots of things, but one of the most important things it does is it's an experience simulator. Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing. They can't pick their print out of a lineup. They like better the one they own, but they don't know they own it."
"The ability to make up your mind and change your mind is the friend of natural happiness. But freedom to choose is the enemy of synthetic happiness, and I'm going to show you why. The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck."

"When we're thinking like academics, we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines, like computers or cars. But when we revert to being human, we behave more like Basil Fawlty, who thrashed his car to teach it a lesson.

The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms, as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe."
" evolutionary biologist: Our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude, of size and speed which our bodies operate at. ""Middle World"" is the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act. We are evolved denizens of Middle World, and that limits what we are capable of imagining."
"In Middle World, air friction is always there. Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy. Steve Grand, in his book, ""Creation: Life and How to Make It,"" is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter."
"The author of the book says we are more like a wave than a permanent thing. He says we have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors which couldn't walk through rocks. This means that quantum theory has got to be, in some sense, true, he says."
"For an animal, is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival. Because different species live in different worlds, there will be a discomforting variety of ""reallys"" What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world, but a model of the world."
"In ""The Fabric of Reality,"" physicist David Deutsch explores the nature of reality. Deutsch: ""We're blind to all frequencies outside that, unless we use instruments to help us"" He says we could make a similar scale of improbabilities; nothing is totally impossible."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at a new way to think about life in the universe. Sutter: In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time, that which seems impossible in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable. The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents."
"In the experiment, a subject is shown two pictures, one of which is slightly different from the other. The subject is then asked to press a button when they see the change in the picture. Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button."
"Dennett: Scientists, using their from-the-outside, third-person methods, can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of. Dennett: And we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind."
"Everybody's an expert on consciousness. We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down. We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games. They all have an idea for a video game even if they're not experts."
"Saul Steinberg painted a picture of a man looking at a painting by Braque. The image is supposed to show the stream of consciousness. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them. Not a single one of those cells is conscious."
"Marvin says people are left unsatisfied when he attempts to explain consciousness. Marvin: 'Real magic' refers to the magic that is not real; while 'real' magic can actually be done. He says: 'If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks, it's not real consciousness'"
"The philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness. The magician doesn't really saw the lady in half, he merely makes you think that he does. People's memories inflate what they think they saw. The same is true of consciousness."
"CNN's John Sutter is working on a feature-length documentary on consciousness. Sutter: How can it be that there are all those changes going on, and that we're not aware of them? Sutter predicts that if you did experiments of this sort, people were unable to pick up really large changes."
"CNN's John Sutter visits a museum in North Carolina to see a Bellotto painting. As he gets closer to the painting, he finds the detail isn't there at all. Sutter: ""It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is"""
"When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist, suggests a person -- say, one of Marvin Minsky's little society of mind -- do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere? Not a chance. The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there."
"There's been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science. Even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know. You just know that you have certain beliefs. And they come in a certain order, at a certain time."
"The cube is seen as a cube on a black background, as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese. When you see the cube one way, behind the screen, those boundaries go away. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say."
"Acousticians are in conversation with people who are hearing impaired, and who are participators of sound. ""We imagine that's what deafness is about. Or we go like that, and we imagine that’s what blindness is about,"" he says."

"When he was a full-time student at a so-called ""music institution,"" all of that went out of the window. ""We had to study from study books,"" he says. ""It was such an unbelievable experience, because where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music?"""
"The sound of a drum is a combination of the sound of the drum, the wind, and the wind itself. The sound is created when the drum is struck by a mallet or a harpist's harp. The drum sounds like it is resonating, but it is actually a different sound."
"""We have to listen to ourselves, first of all,"" he says. ""You feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick, even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly"" ""I have more dynamic with less effort. And I'm doing far, far less,"" he adds."
"""My job is to teach the world to listen,"" says the musician. ""We all have our own little sound colors, as it were, that make up these extraordinary personalities and interests,"" he says. ""And it's amazing that when you do open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through, that in fact the tiny, tiny difference -- (Marimba sounds)"
"Music is ""my only real aim in life,"" says the composer. ""Music really is our daily medicine,"" he says. ""Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting, will experience this sound quite, quite differently"""
"CNN's John Defterios has been working with the Chinese government on a project to build a new city. The city will be built on the site of a former coal mine, which was abandoned in the 1980s. Defterius says the city will have to be built from scratch, and it will need a lot of money."
"The city is being built on the site of a former sheep farm. The land will be used to build a new city. The city will have a 24-hour water supply and sanitation system. It will also have a public park, which will be open to the public."
"""We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs. The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next"" ""We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors. That was one sentence. Henry James would be proud"""
"The first question for designers is, how do we love all the children of all species for all time? And so we start our designs with that question. If we come here and say, ""Well, I didn't intend to cause global warming,"" then we realize it's part of our de facto plan."
"Environmentalists want a ""delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world"" They want clean air, clean water, soil and power -- economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed. ""There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game,"" he says."
"We see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don't. We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again because of the contaminants. We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable, down to the parts per million."
"The Gap's corporate campus has an ancient meadow as its nesting grounds. The Gap was founded by Gap founder and CEO Gap Inc. in 1968. The company is now one of the world's largest clothing retailers. The store is based in Houston, Texas, and is owned by Gap."
"""Cradle to Cradle"" is a book about the design of trees. The book's first chapter is called ""This Book is Not a Tree"" The book is a collection of photos of trees in the wild. It's also a guide to how to make a tree into a sustainable tree."

"We want growth, we want free energy from sunlight, and we want an open metabolism for chemicals. We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing. We need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects."
"The Model U for Ford Motor, a cradle to cradle car -- concept car. Shoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable, the bottoms are biodegradable soles. A building at Oberlin College that makes more energy than it needs and purifies its own water."
"The Internet is the ""very, very early"" stage of innovation, he says. In 1917, Sears ran an advertisement saying: ""Use your electricity for more than light"" The parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly, he adds."
"People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news, thought, ""Ah, this isn't real"" The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak of the Gold Rush. People dropped what they were doing, no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold."
"In the Klondike Gold Rush, soldiers loaded up their mules and their horses and didn't plan right. The same thing happened on the Internet. You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever. When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier."
"Jeff Bezos: The Internet has had such an incredible last half a dozen years, that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it. He says there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic. Bezos: There are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry."
"The Web is an incredible means of coordinating, in a very fine-grained way, information flows. The light bulb is what wired the world. The Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network."
"The golden age of appliances lasted anywhere from 40 to 60 years. The light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure, and then home appliances started coming into being. The electric fan was a big success, and the electric iron was also very big. But not all these things were highly successful."
"CNN's John Sutter looks back at one of the greatest inventions of all time. The electric shoe warmer. Sutter: ""It's just not the right time for an invention"" to be relaunched. ""We'd need the right partner. We'd need to do it again"""
The washing machine was an object of much envy and lust. The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other. It's a big deal. And there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.
"phthalmologist: ""This is a total kludge, if you ask me"" ""Have you tried to install 802.11 yourself? I challenge you to try"" ""It's very hard. It's a total, total mess"" ""We think it's getting better"""
"The Internet is at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet, he says. With innovation, there isn't a last nugget. Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities, he adds. The Internet is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it's being used."
"In 1998: ""Amazon.toast"" In 1999: ""It's Raining, It's Pouring"" I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring. I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, ""Good morning"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the ""mockingbird"" phenomenon in Monterey, California. Sutter: ""The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes, and here we are, right in the middle"" ""It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn,"" he says."
Mockingbirds are the emcees of the animal kingdom. They listen and mimic and remix what they like. They rock the mic outside my window every morning. I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails.
"CNN's John Sutter asks how we can find God in all things. Sutter: How could one practice such a faith? By seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness. By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness, Sutter says."
"A vicar in the Church of England offers new ways of thinking about God. The ideas are well known in liberal academic circles, but clergy like himself have been reluctant to air them. The people most affected by the tsunami do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen."
"Priest: We want an explanation from God. We want a God who can weep with those who weep. The unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me, he says. Some have concluded that we can only believe in aGod who shares our pain."
"Many people have asked, ""Where is God in all this?"" And the answer is, ""God is in this with us, or God doesn't deserve our allegiance"" So we have a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul. But it isn't enough."
"CNN's John Sutter asks: Does God have a plan for each of us? Sutter: If he does, why didn't he stop the tsunami in Japan? He asks: Do we have a God who looks after His own, while everyone else perishes?"
"""We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz"" ""If we believe something like this, we must let go of the puppet-master completely"" ""We must think again about God. He is not the supreme commander toying with expendable units"""
"Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person, doing things all over the place. Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents, he says. What if God is in things? In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life, he asks."
"In 1998, Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists. Among this select group, belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent. To have faith in this God would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe."
"Among biological scientists, only 5.5 percent, only, believe in God. About 20 percent are agnostic; the rest could fairly be called atheists. American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest. We need a consciousness-raising, coming-out campaign for American atheists."
"Darwin himself preferred ""agnostic"" -- and not only out of loyalty to his friend Huxley, who coined the term. The word ""atheist"" itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means."
"Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia, but that ordinary people were not, quote, ""ripe for it"" The list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots; it's infinite."
"""If we want to attract deep-down atheists to come out publicly, we're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than ""tooth-fairy"" or ""teapot agnostic"" So, how about ""humanist""? This has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations and journals and things already in place."
"The word ""atheist"" carries frissons of hysterical phobia, he says. ""Science is so much more exciting, more poetic, more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination,"" he writes. The religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations, he adds."
"""Finding Darwin's God,"" by Kenneth Miller, is one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design. Creationists, lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case, fall back on the popular phobia against atheism. People like me, on the other hand, rock the boat."
"""I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith"" ""If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith, I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science"" ""The problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things"""
"""Theory of evolution is not a theory, it is a process of evolution,"" he says. ""It's a series of steps that lead up to the present moment in time"" ""It is not the same as saying that the universe is God, it's just that he is the creator of the universe,"" he adds. ""The world is not God, he is just the messenger"""
"CNN's John Defterios takes on the issue of whether an asteroid killed the dinosaurs. He says religion is corrosive to science. Defterio: ""It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations"""
"In 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr. whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists. Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous. He stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal. He really meant it."
"An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal. To own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub. Christianity, of course, takes a massive lion's share of the population, with nearly 160 million."
"CNN's John Sutter asks if there's a correlation between intelligence and tendency to be religious. A recent article in Mensa magazine provides some straws in the wind, Sutter says. Sutter: Of 43 studies on relationship between religious belief and intelligence, all but four found an inverse connection."
"In 1968, the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain was covered in 151 inches of snow pack. 10 years later, the snow packs eroded, and, if you notice, the trees have started turning yellow. The water level of the lake has started drying up. And I fear, if we do nothing for our planet, in 20 years, it's going to look like this."
"Mentions of polar bears drowning: four percent. Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu: 64 percent. David Pogue singing show tunes. If the conference is anywhere near this distressing, then we're going to have a scream bag next year."

"Rick Warren and Daniel Dennett are duking it out on a scale of religiosity. The scales range from zero percent, or atheist, to 100 percent, Bible literally true. Warren is pulling ahead, kind of pulling ahead. Dennett is getting a little bigger."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his new $100 computer. Sutter: ""I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks. I thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that"" ""We're trying to check and trying to douse here, and see who uses marijuana,"" Sutter says."
"Smallpox is an extremely distressing illness. We had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox. The good news is, because I'm a trained medical professional, I know that even though she'll be scarred for life, she'll make a full recovery."
"The U.N. is sending over 50,000 shipping containers of Google snacks to the U.S. to support the Google Foundation's work. The Google Foundation has also created a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups and Gummy Bears."
"Tom Reilly: Free Bird reminds me that if you listen to ""Free Bird"" backwards, this is what you might hear. Dan Dennett worships Satan. Buy ""The Purpose-Driven Life,"" or Satan will take your soul."
"CNN's John Sutter talks with Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center and the conferences. Sutter: ""It's getting awfully big. It's getting just a little bit too big"" ""I'm completely politically correct, and I mean everything with great affection,"" Sutter says."
"The convention center in Monterey, California, will be built on stilts. The convention center will have a bookstore, a Google cafe, a hotel and a Steinbeck forum. The hotel and Portola Plaza will be on the top of the building."
"The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain, inducing suicidal behavior. Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds, and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant, crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass."
"Islam means ""surrender,"" or ""submission of self-interest to the will of Allah"" It's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains, he says. Many people have laid down their lives for communism, and many for capitalism."
"Darwin's theory of life: Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it. Many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy -- would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes. ""Most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking,"" he says."
"Dawkins invented the term ""memes,"" and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book ""The Selfish Gene"" It is important, I think, to Richard, and to me, that these ideas not be abused and misused."
" Negroponte: ""Memes are like viruses. They're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium"" ""A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude,"" he says. ""That's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude"""
"The Shakers are extinct now, but not because they were celibate, he says. They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there. The idea was passed on through proselytizing, instead of through the gene line."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the implications of the memetic perspective. He says people are resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking. Sutter: ""These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures"" ""It's part of their plan,"" he says."
"We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture. We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off. But for many people in the world, they are a big deal. And we should be very alert to this."
"Google co-founder Sergey Brin: ""There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do"" The ultimate search engine would be smart, Brin says. ""The idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search, you really have to be smart,"" he says."
"Google has added a feature to its AdSense ads called ""related searches"" The feature allows users to search for a specific search term on a blog. Sergey Brin: ""We always hope that Google will be smart, but we're always surprised when other people think that it is"" Brin says Google's algorithms read the blog of a young person who was depressed."
"Google is able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money. We never accept payment for our search results, and we mark it as such, unlike many of our competitors. And I think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world, and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google."
"It's hard to get the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. It has to go all over the world: through fibers, through satellites, through all kinds of connections. And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try."
"Google is launching the Google Foundation. The foundation will be an even broader endeavor. Google also has a program called Google Grants that now serves over 150 different charities around the world. It's something I'm very excited to be a part of, he says."
"Orkut is a social network that lets users invite each other to join. The site has more than 100,000 members. Orkut was created by an engineer who had a vision to create a new social network. The network was released in a test phase last month and is taking off."
"Google's search engine is expanding outside the U.S. Larry Page: ""It's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes"" He says the idea is, for 20 percent of your time, you can do what you think is the best thing to do."
"After 9/11, a Google employee got really interested in the news. He started clustering it by category, and then he started using it. Then, he and his friends started use it. And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom, we made it a Googlette."
"The Deskbar is a new version of the Google Toolbar. The idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom. The ""Buy Iceland"" ad was from a media article. The Deskbar lets you do searches really easily."
"Google CEO Eric Schmidt talks about some of the innovative things his company has done in recent years. Google Answers, for example, is a service that lets people search for answers to questions without spending all that time yourself. The company also built a system that automatically sends notes to everyone in a meeting when they're in the room."
"The site uses AdSense to show you relevant ads. The ads are generated automatically from the content on the site. The idea is to make advertising useful, not just annoying. The site has a self-serve program, and many thousands of websites have signed up."

"When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending. We need better places in this country. This is a good public space. It's a place worth caring about. It has something that is terribly important -- it has an active and permeable membrane."
"This is the back of Boston City Hall, the most important civic building in Albany, New York. This is the other side of the building. This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that. This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein."
"The pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal. Buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge, so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building."
"The remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings, he says. The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it: To spatially denote the pedestrian realm, to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway, to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk, and to soften the hardscape."
"CNN's John Sutter: "" suburbia hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now"" ""It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a Cartoon of the country,"" Sutter says. ""These places, these habitats, are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,"" he says."

"Brain memory is a memory of very high-dimensional patterns, like the things that come from your eyes. It's also memory of sequences: you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence. A song must be heard in sequence over time, and you must play it back in sequence."
"The same techniques we use to build silicon computer memories, we can use here. We'll attach these memories to sensors, and the sensors will experience real-live, real-world data, and learn about their environment. The new brain is easier than the old brain."
Brain science and memories are going to be a very fundamental technology. We can also do intelligent security systems. I'm most excited about how we're going to use them in science. I don't know how this will turn out. It will lead to unbelievable changes in the next 100 years.

"Theories of the solar system, evolution and tectonic plates all have a lot in common with brain science. The best minds were stumped -- really smart people. It just turns out it's hard to think of things, but once you've thought of them, it's easy to understand."
"If you believe in evolution, we all have a common ancestor. Intelligence is defined by prediction. We're intelligent because of how we do things and how we behave intelligently. We study theoretical neuroscience and how the neocortex works. The Bible says God created all these species, cats are cats; dogs are dogs; people are people."
"Alan Turing defined the Turing test, which essentially says, we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human. Reality, though -- I call it real intelligence -- is built on something else. We experience the world through a sequence of patterns, and we store them and recall them. When we recall them, we match them up against reality."
"In evolution with mammals, we developed a thing called the neocortex. Neocortex means ""new layer"" It's a new layer on top of your brain. The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain. It's your emotional brain."
"The memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain. The neocortex is just memorizing. It's sitting there saying, I'm going to memorize where I've been, people I've seen, things I've heard, and so on."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about AI's ability to predict the future. He explains how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works, how it is we store patterns and make predictions. Defterio: AI copied the posterior, the back part, which is sensory, and put it in the front."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to CNN iReport about the power of vision. Sutter: ""When we look at people, our eyes saccade over two to three times a second"" ""If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future"""
"The Mola mola is in ""The Guinness World Book of Records"" for being the world's heaviest bony fish. It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily. The sunfish's other name is Hawaiian, but it's actually Latin for millstone."
"The Mola appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared, 65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs. They are the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea, right up there with flat fish. They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults. A single four-foot female can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries."
"Molas put on 600 million times an increase in weight. They make up a large portion of the California by-catch -- up to 26 percent of the drift net. In the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries, they make up up to 90 percent."
"The Mola can record temperature, depth and light intensity, which is correlated with time. The Molas have 40 genera of parasites, and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem. They don't seem to mind, so far."
"The Molas are often found in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. They are often caught in fishing gear and thrown back into the ocean. The Molas can be tough to catch, but when they are caught, they can be hard to kill."
"The Mola is a species of fish found in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars. The Mola are not big migrators, but they do forage in the Kuroshio Current."
The Mola is a species of fish that lives in the waters off the coast of southern Africa. The Mola can dive down to one degree centigrade. The Census of Marine Life will allow the public to learn more about the Mola.
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his TED Talk series on climate change. Sutter: ""I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis"" ""One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,"" he says. ""I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy"""
"Two years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is the next big thing. Wal-Mart made going green a top priority. The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration."
Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers. 65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. Wal-Mart will sell another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. Consumers don't really like these light bulbs. The pay-off is really enormous.
"CNN's John Sutter learns that policy matters. California was the first state in this country to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020. Sutter: As long as we pretend that CO2 is free, as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?"
"California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions. Brazil's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol. In three years, Brazil's new car fleet has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel."
"Brazil has replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol. The country has saved 32 million tons of CO2. Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering a radical new way to make the key ingredient, artemisinin."
"Kleiner: ""We're investing 200 million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies"" Kleiner: In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. ""It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars,"" Kleiner says."
"The U.S. has enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years. The scientists tell us -- and they're only guessing -- that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half, and do it as fast as possible."
"Going green could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century. Energy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide. You can personally get carbon neutral. Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com. You could join other leaders in mandating, lobbying for mandated cap and trade."
"We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad. We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish like that. This is a project called Photosynth, which marries two different technologies. One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research."
"Microsoft's new Photosynth tool uses computer vision to create panoramic images. The project is powered by Seadragon, a computer vision tool developed by Microsoft's R&D director at Microsoft Research, Noah Szeliski. The tool is available on the Microsoft Research website."
"This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered. You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth."
"Microsoft is developing software that will allow people to link images together. The software is based on the content inside the images. The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's also very flexible architecture, says BAA's Chris Anderson."
"TED Talk: ""We're all trying to become TEDsters, if that's a modern form of enlightenment"" ""We do enjoy our misery in a certain way. We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere, but basically we are sort of stuck inside our skins"""
"Buddha's view is that all we are is what is inside our skin. The idea that it is us all alone, each of us, and everyone else is different, puts us in an impossible situation. compassion comes when you lose yourself in some way, through art, meditation or knowledge."
"The Dalai Lama says compassion comes when you realize your pains and pleasures are too small a theater for your intelligence. The more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets. The good time is over when you think, how good is it? And then it's never good enough."
"Dalai Lama: ""The key to saving the world, the key to compassion is that it is more fun"" Dalai Lama: Generosity should be done by fun. ""You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is, how it can be changed"""
"Compassion means to feel the feelings of others, and the human being actually is compassion. The first person who gets happy when you do that, you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself. And you realize that this is the flower garden that Chiho showed us."

"Virtual Earth is the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world. It collects data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people. Virtual Earth is also panchromatic and multi-spectral. It's a new approach to desktop computing."
"Virtual Earth collects four gigabits per second of data, equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone. Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth."
"Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually. We do this all through software, algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities. A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller."

"CNN's John Sutter talks about the need for regenerative medicine. Sutter: ""This is not a new idea, it's a new way of looking at the world"" He says the idea of regenerating organs is a long way from what's been done."
"The longer we live, the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older. In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree in the Untied States of America. In 2010, two workers per retiring person in the U.S."
"Around age 45, there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care, he says. One thing you can do is not treat. You can prevent it. And you can treat the disease to cure it, rather than treat a symptom."
"With diabetes, what do we do? We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic, and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years. But eventually it stops working, and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease. Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate it early on?"
"We need to learn to speak the body's language. We heal ourselves in a natural process, using cells to do most of the work. If we can find the right cells and implant them in the body, they may do the healing."
"Professor Steve Badylak: If we can invent materials, design materials, or extract materials from a natural environment, then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself. Professor: The small intestine of a pig, if you threw away all the cells, and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active, may contain all of the necessary factors and signals."
"Steve Wozniacki invented a new type of gel that can be applied to wounds to heal them. 400,000 patients around the world have used the gel to heal their wounds. The gel induces the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before."
"DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question. Steve: Could you, say, instead of using material, can I take some cells along with the material, and remove a damaged piece of tissue, put a bio-degradable material on there? Steve: There are materials that do this."
"Stem cells from the patient are injected directly into the heart of the patient. If you look really carefully, it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back-flush. The coolest thing would be if you could diagnose the disease early, and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state."
" Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand. You can take patients who are less sick, and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy. We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army."
"AIDS is a policy issue, not just a facts-based issue, he says. In Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent, if you have one more partner this year, your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points."
AIDS epidemic is getting worse. People are learning more things about it. We see almost no change in sexual behavior. AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS. But how much you want to invest is going to depend on how long you expect to live.
"The number of sexual partners is decreasing in areas with low levels of malaria. In areas with high levels, the number of sex partners is increasing. This is not just through malaria. It's also because people are less likely to have sex with other people."
"AIDS is not going to fix itself. People aren't changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in the epidemic. Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding, may not be enough. We're going to need to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective."
"There's almost no good data on the prevalence of HIV in Africa until about 2003. The only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991 were STD patients and pregnant women. In the last few years, there's been testing in random samples of the population. But this leaves a big gap."
"HIV kills people in the prime of their lives. The death rates in Botswana and Egypt are much, much higher than in Egypt. The UNAIDS estimates of HIV prevalence in Africa are higher than the mortality-based estimates. If you think that 25 million people are infected, maybe that's only 10 or 15 million."
"HIV epidemic was introduced to the US by one male steward on an airline flight. Truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people. Areas with a lot of economic activity have higher prevalence of HIV. But that doesn't mean that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence."
"Data suggests that if you double export volume, it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections. This has important implications both for forecasting and for policy. But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know. Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS, it's not necessarily the case."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the decline in new HIV infections in the U.S. Sutter: ""I hope that I've told you something that you didn't know"" He says the decline is due to a decline in the number of people who are infected with the virus."

CNN's John Sutter has created a map of the world's current mythology. Each star represents a specific event in the real world. Sutter: We can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe. The data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources.
We can see the stories that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now. We can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe. You can see that this is an important story; there are a lot of things in its orbit.
"We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so. We can see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday, but he was back to work on Sunday morning, and actually been tapering off since then this week. The superstars of climate change in 2006: United States, Britain, China."
Each ant experiences a stream of contacts with other ants. The pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out. The rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.
"In a small colony, an ant is likely to meet another forager every three seconds. In a larger colony, the ant will meet fewer foragers. This pattern of interaction allows the ants to make more offspring. This is the way the ants make their own offspring."
"An ant starts as an egg, then it's a larva. Then they're pupae, then they come out as adult ants. They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest, and the queen never comes out again. They make a midden, a pile of refuse."
"An ant colony grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five. colony size changes as a function of colony age, in years. When extra food becomes available, extra ants are allocated to collect the food."
"There are about 10,000 species of ants. They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens, and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers. An ant starts out somewhere near the queen. When we dig up nests we find they're about as deep as the colony is wide."
"At any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing. The queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs. The larvae, and they consume most of the food. The foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber."
No ant directs the behavior of any other ant. The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management. No queen tells anybody what to do. No ant can send chemical messages through a network of chambers to tell the ants outside what they should do.
"The different tasks are interdependent. The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole whole life. If I put out extra food, everybody else -- the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food, they become foragers. If there's more patrolling to do, the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol."
"The ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ant in the younger colony. It's not due to the experience of older, wiser ants. Instead, something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older. The obvious thing that's changing is its size."
"Ants are using a network of antennal contact. When one ant touches another, it's smelling it, and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate. Ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming, with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor."
"""I think of the games that I do, I think of really more as modern Montessori toys. And I really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles,"" he says."
"""Spore"" is a game that lets players design and control a single-cell creature. The game is designed to be played at all different scales, from very small to very large. ""I've been working on it for several years. It's getting pretty close to finished now"""
"The game lets players create their own creatures from scratch. ""We didn't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that, because it's almost more interesting to look at alternate possibilities in evolution,"" says creator. The game is designed to be played through every generation of the creature."
"The idea is that the player can basically design anything they can think of in this editor, and we'll basically bring it to life. The program has some understanding of the topology of this creature. It knows where the backbone is, where the spine, the limbs are, how stripes should run."
Players create content in the game that is automatically sent up to a server and redistributed to all the other players transparently. The computer is procedurally animating this creature. It's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life. But that's not what I want to talk about today.
This is the first stage of the game. The game is supposed to be played out over time. It's a game that lets the player control a character. The player controls the character and the environment around him or her. The goal is to create a world that the player can control.
"This is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas. Things like the buildings, the vehicles, the architecture, civilizations were all designed by the player up to this point. I want them, after they've played this game, to have extracted an entire world that they're now interacting with."
"In the game, the player can pump more CO2 into the atmosphere. Over time, this is going to heat up the planet. At some point it's going to get so hot the oceans will evaporate. The game is the sequel to ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" in about two minutes."
"Computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time. I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods.

"An African economy can be broken up into three sectors. There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector and the traditional sector. The modern sector is the abode of the elites. It's the seat of government. The traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture."
"In traditional African systems, Africans organize their states in two types. The first belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state is necessarily tyrannous. These societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus, for example. The other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs, made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils."
"The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption. The accent is on the ""I"" in Africa, the Africans say, ""I am, because we are"" The ""we"" connotes community -- the extended family system."
Africa is not the same country it was before independence. It is a nation of small-scale entrepreneurs. They are the future of the continent. They need to be encouraged to invest in their own communities. They must not wait for government to do it for them.
"For the first time there really is a platform to build on, he says. ""Africa: the Next Chapter"" will focus on how to leverage the good will that is coming towards the continent. ""If we fail to use it as catalytic, we would have failed,"" he says of aid."
"Nigeria is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen. The Chinese minister of finance said to me, when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria, ""We can make a catalytic"" One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women, to create jobs."

"African leaders have been engaging in the wrong debate about aid, says Malala. The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid, he says. The issue is how are we using what has been given back, Malala says."
"Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war -- from 1967 to '70. ""I want to tell you a little story. Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well,"" he says."
"""Africa: the Next Chapter"" is a new series on CNN.com. This week, we look at the past and the present in South Africa. The first episode is about a young boy and his sister suffering from malaria. ""I put my sister on my back -- burning -- and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped to my back,"" he says."
"""I was so happy that my sister was alive,"" he says. ""You don't care what it is. You just want the person to be alive"" He says he is proud to have been part of the team that saved the woman's life."
"If we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria, it means they can form the base of production for our economy. If we don't and they die, their children will become a burden on the economy. So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say let's channel these resources we get into something productive."

"African leaders can emerge a great society within one generation, he says, but it will depend on inspired leadership. Africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent. The manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference."
"CNN's John Defterios writes about his time in Ghana. He says he was shocked by the level of corruption he saw in the country. Defterio: ""We need to change the way we look at the world. We need to look at how we can make a difference"""
"I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill. It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16. I got lucky.

"The media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth. But the media is not telling us the whole truth. The Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly. The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair."
"Poverty reduction should be a challenge of creating wealth, he says. Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job. Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign. Support research institutions because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation."
"African leaders are throwing large sums of money for primary health, for primary education, for food relief. The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair, in need of charity, says Bono. ""The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity,"" he says."
"African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.

"The English language is as big as it is. When people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map, they think, ""This map sucks!"" When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, people think ""This must be a bad word"""
"Dictionary is not carved out of granite, out of a lump of rock, it's made up of lots of little bits. When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them. If you've got an artificial constraint, artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions."
"TED Talk: How do I know if a word is real? ""If you love a word, it becomes real"" ""Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction"" ""You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful"""
"If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it, that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries. If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it, it would be an entire other OED."

"The Internet is great for collecting words, because the Internet's full of collectors. There are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now. The problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough. The Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm."
"Dictionaries stand for the whole language, not just ""a dictionary,"" or ""dictionaries,"" he says. ""A word without its source is like a cut flower. You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies. It dies too fast"""
"Dictionaries used to look like an eight-track tape, but now they look more like this. The format that died because it wasn't useful enough, he says.

"The 11 Holy Numbers: The proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking process. The wings pump up air in lemonade bottles, which are on top of that. They can use that energy in case the wind falls away, and the tide is coming up."
"It has a feeler, where it can feel obstacles and turn around. It sucks in air normally, but when it swallows water, it feels the resistance of it. As soon as it touches the water -- you should hear the sound of running air."
"Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution. Eventually, these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches. The wind may turn, but the animal will always turn its nose into the wind. It'll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the decline of violence in the world. Sutter: The more you think about and interact with other people, the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs. ""We are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species's existence,"" Sutter says."
"Steven Pinker: The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements or government. Until the Age of Reason in the 16th century, violence was common in the Middle Ages."
"The death rate in tribal warfare has fallen from 100 million in the 20th century to less than 10 million. This is according to a new study by the University of California, Los Angeles. The study looked at mortality rates in the New Guinea highlands and the Amazon."
"Criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates. He plotted on a logarithmic scale, and the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year. Worldwide, there's been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the decline in violence in the U.S. Sutter: ""Why are so many people so wrong about something so important?"" He says there are a number of reasons. One of them is we have better reporting, Sutter says."
"Why has violence declined? No one really knows, but I have read four explanations, all of which, I think, have some grain of plausibility. The first is that maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right. In a state of anarchy, there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively, before they invade you."
"Hobbes' theory was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency, then any kind of aggression would be punished. Eisner argued that the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states. Technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant."
"Singer: Language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature, so much as a window onto human nature. He says the vagueness of language is a feature of language, one that we use to our advantage in social interactions."
"The verb is the chassis of the sentence. It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted. An intransitive verb, such as ""dine,"" can't take a direct object. You can't just say, ""Sam devoured the pizza."" There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type."
"""Give the muffin to the mouse"" is not the same as ""give the person a headache"" ""Give the person the headache"" means ""give them something to do"" ""The person"" is the thing that is caused by the action."
"There's a level of conceptual structure, which we automatically compute every time we produce or utter a sentence. The language of thought is based on a fixed set of concepts, which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs. All of the constructions in English are used not only literally, but in a quasi-metaphorical way."
"The ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways is a fundamental feature of human thought. We use ""force"" to indicate not only physical force, but also interpersonal force. In polite requests, if someone says, ""If you could pass the guacamole,"" we know exactly what he means."
"The World Wide Web, the French are told, ought to be referred to as ""la toile d'araignee mondiale"" -- the Global Spider Web. The key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships. Human relationships fall into a number of types that can be negotiated."
"Language has to convey the actual content, but also negotiate and maintain the relationship with the other person. If you express your request as a conditional -- ""if you could open the window, that would be great"" -- you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance. By expressing it as an if-then statement, you can get the message across without appearing to boss."
"Researchers have created robots that learn how to walk in simulation and in reality. The robots are not ready to take over the world yet, but they are gradually learning how to move forward. They are rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move."
"Robots can be programmed to move in a certain way. They can also be rewarded for certain actions. The robots can be taught to move by throwing cubes into a soup. The cubes can swivel, or flip on their side, depending on how they're thrown."
"In absence of any reward, the intrinsic reward is self-replication. These robots are of course not very useful in themselves, but they might teach us something about how we can build better robots. We have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually, but actually let them evolve and learn, like children."
"Scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent. We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer. You know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes. It's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms."
"Astronomers have found that stars similar to our Sun brighten by a factor of as much as 20. These are super-flares, millions of times more powerful than any flares we've had from our Sun so far. One percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it would cause one hell of an ice age."
"CNN's John Berman says old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics. The danger is that a simple germ, like staph, will mutate into something virulent, he says. Berman: Our public health system, as we saw with anthrax, is a real disaster."
"We think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the Milky Way alone, our galaxy. These stars have compressed down to maybe something like 12, 15 miles wide. And they are gobbling up everything around them, including light, which is why we can't see them."
"Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years. A small asteroid, say a half mile wide, would touch off firestorms. An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions. There are probably 700,000 asteroids between Mars and Jupiter that are a half a mile big or bigger."
"The chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you is about one in 20,000, according to the work they've done. NASA's spending three million dollars a year, three million bucks -- that is like pocket change -- to search for asteroids."
"A year ago, NASA sent a probe out to this asteroid belt, called NEAR, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous. The probe orbited a 22-mile long asteroid called Eros. A small ion propulsion motor would gently, slowly, after a period of time, push it into a different trajectory, if we've done our math right."
"We live in an incredible age of modern medicine, but mentally, we're falling apart. The World Health Organization now estimates that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed. A female child born tomorrow, on average -- median -- will live to age 83."
"We don't really have mental health insurance in this country, and it's -- (Applause) -- it's really a crime. We need a pump-push from the federal government, through NIH and National Science -- NSF. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way, and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years, there must be billions and billions in the universe."
"There's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own, he says. If we want humanity to last forever, we have to colonize the Milky Way, Steve says. We have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation, he adds."
"We're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of 10,000. We have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years. The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly, that we don't know they're really in trouble."
"We need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet, and start moving them around. We're going to have to have no-take zones. There's a collider at Brookhaven, on Long Island, this spring, that is expecting to create little, tiny black holes."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the dangers of Bt corn. Sutter: Biotechnology could destroy the world's food supply in very short order. He says we need to treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants. ""This is an amazingly unregulated field,"" he says."
"The first technology appeared in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago. DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches that we diverged sometime around seven million years old. Evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old -- beads. And you can do the same with your genes and track them back."
"Paleontology is a systematic and scientific approach. It takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access. When you get there, the vastness of the place makes you feel helpless and vulnerable. And you find nothing for years and years."
"Selam is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology. The spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block, because she was buried by a river. It took five years of cleaning, preparation and description."
The first human remains found in Africa were discovered in Ethiopia. They were found in the remains of a young woman. The bones show that the woman was an infant when she died. She is believed to be one of the first humans to walk on the ground.
"Skeleton of a girl who died 3.3 million years ago shows she had very small canine teeth. She walked upright, but had some adaptation for tree climbing. The brain in this child was still growing. At age three, if you have a still-growing brain, it's a human behavior."
"Selam, the earliest child ever discovered, to tell you a story of all of us. The still-growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood, which requires an incredible social organization, emerged over three million years ago. Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human."
The fossil is of a three-year-old girl who lived 3.3 million years ago. She is the most complete example of a human-like creature to be found so far. The fossil shows that our ancestors were far more advanced than we are today.

"The film is a new way of trying to tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in. The way I learned about Taji was Taji sent me an email, and in it, attached a photo of that burned body out at the car."

"CNN's John Defterios travels to Germany to meet the team at the Free University of Berlin. The Free University is a state-of-the-art building that uses a combination of steel and concrete. Defterius: ""It's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse. It's a celebration"""
"The first computer was used to design Stansted Airport's Terminal Four in the 1990s. The building was clad in hand-cut shingles, one quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish. Stansted's green alternative, which uses natural light, is a friendly place: you know where you are and can relate to the outside."
"It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now. I mean, major transformation. Going back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin. In 1987, she had all our information on one disk. Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks."
"Swiss Re has designed a new office building in London. The building is made up of a mesh of triangulated structures. The top of the building is celebratory. It's a viewing place for people, not machinery. It also has the ability, all the time, regardless of the direction of the wind."
Pipeline will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea. It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment. Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication. The project could bring warring factions together in a united cause.
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a series of stories on the future of the world's infrastructure. He says the world needs a new kind of infrastructure, one that is more sustainable. Defterio: ""We need a new generation of engineers, architects, designers, engineers, to make this world a better place"""
"Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru -- again, a word that had not been coined. He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet, but he foresaw all the things that are happening now. The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day."
"Architects' union celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. Founder and CEO of the union says the digital world has become humanized. He says buildings are important, but they're only a component of a much bigger picture. ""You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit"""
"As the density of a city increases, the energy consumed reduces dramatically. Of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity, mass transit, the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance. But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top, extraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen."
"Technology is changing the way buildings are designed and built, says Sir Tim Berners-Lee. New technology can lead to buildings which consume less energy, create less pollution and are more socially responsible, he says. A corporate headquarters in a small market town in the northeast of England is a good example of a green building."
"In 1975, the image there is of typewriters. And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors. And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology. We were fortunate, because in a way our building was future-proofed."
"The author conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India. He asked them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions. The children were clearly confused, because half said yes and half said no. They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question."
"Educationists have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it, he says. Remoteness affects the quality of education. Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed. And learning is most likely a self-organizing system. He says it's time that educationists made their own specs."
"The remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be. The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully. I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school, probably has a deep impact on what happens."
"Teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools. The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature -- consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing. The relative change that ET would make would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about the hole-in-the-wall experiment in New Delhi in 1999. The experiment involved embedding a PC into the wall of a slum. The PC was put on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, and left there. Defterio: ""About eight hours later, we found this kid. ... teaching her to browse"""
The first kid who came there turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout. He noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television.
"In a village in northeastern India, there was no English teacher, so the children had not learned English at all. One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums: there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk. So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier."
"Researchers used computers to teach children to read, write and learn in remote Indian villages. They found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment, irrespective of anything that we could measure. They also found that if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves."
"Over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer. This is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird."
"The AV Pointer sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator. With on-board GPS, it can navigate autonomously, and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage. The Gossamer Condor is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations."
"The Walkalong Glider soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff. As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so as you walk through the air, it goes around you. The launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head, and you start walking forward."
"AeroVironment started in 1971 with no employees, then one or two, three, and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects. ""I was going to bring an airplane, but I was worried about hitting people in here, so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle"""
"In 1982, the Lindbergh Foundation awarded a prize to a man who flew a solar-powered plane across the English Channel. The project was to raise money for the government, but it was also to raise awareness of the importance of solar power. In the year 2000, the project was abandoned, and the prize money went to the government."
"Humans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's mass of vertebrates on land and air. Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve. ""It, I think, shows human domination of the Earth"""
"Paintings show the Earth in a time flag, with dinosaurs on the left and humans on the right. The artist says he has no idea what the future will hold. He has been working on the project since he was a student in the 1970s."
"Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere. ""I am seeing in the major funders, in CARE, Rockefeller, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Hewlett, Mercy Corps, you guys,"" he says. ""We need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming, but on the secondary prevention"""
"50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little. How can that not make you optimistic? A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India, blinded half of all of those who were made blind in India. Doctors, health workers, from 30 different countries, of every race, every religion, every color, worked together."
"The world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history, says Al Gore. We are ripe for zoonotic-borne, emerging communicable diseases, he says. A rise of 6.5 billion to 9. 5 billion in our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poorest and the most vulnerable."
"One percent of us own 40 percent of all the world's goods and services. Darfur is, at its origin, a resource war. Last year, there were 85,000 riots in China, 230 a day. We are facing an unprecedented number, scale of disasters."
"Even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today, the next decades will see rising sea levels. 70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level. Even now, man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate through the waste products of his civilization."
"Global warming is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know, he says. There have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years. Human beings have always risen to the challenge."
"A few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps. Young people are using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did, he says. You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves."
"CNN's John Defterios says the world is beginning to see the benefits of global warming. He says it's a good time to be optimistic about the future of the planet. Defterio: ""The world is starting to see that we are not alone in this struggle"""
"The Saturn system is a rich planetary system. It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare. The investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach. Just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call spiral galaxies."
"The temperature at the surface of Titan is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth. Haze prevents sunlight from getting to the surface. But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on Titan."
"The Huygens probe landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history. It took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface of Titan. It is so significant that, in my mind, this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades."
"""It was a tremendously emotional event, and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either,"" he says. ""This is an international mission, and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany, and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents"""

"Titan is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like. Enceladus is a small moon, about a tenth the size of Titan. From these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles."
"Cassini has taken the first image of Earth from the other side of Saturn's rings. The Cassini spacecraft is now on its way back to Earth. The mission is expected to arrive back in Earth's orbit in mid-September. Cassini will then orbit the Earth for the rest of the year, before returning home."
"The author was sent to prison for mentioning the word "" venereal disease"" in public. He was also sent to jail for telling his children to get out of the car before they went to a friend's house. ""I don't think you can molly-coddle your kids too much,"" he says."
"There's an ancient law that says you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public. We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots, but nobody came with VD any more. So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.

"Synesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists and other creative people than in the general population. In us, all the senses are distinct. The color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus."
"Every time you see a number, you see the corresponding color, and that's why you get synesthesia. In all of us, it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else. Every brain region is wired to every other region, and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain."
"People with synesthesia are eight times more common among poets, artists and novelists. ""I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes, but you're in denial about it,"" he says. ""It's a very phrenological view of synesthesia,"" he adds."
"The brain is able to extract the common denominator. It's a primitive form of abstraction, and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain. When that's damaged, these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki."
"The Capgras delusion is caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus. The syndrome is so rare that few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists. The most common interpretation of this is a Freudian view, and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women, by the way."

"The ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers. The exchange will operate warehouses around the country, in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done. The ECX is also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework for making this market work."

"Africa's farmers are among the most under-capitalized in the world. Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated, compared to 40 percent in Asia. ""The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice, and therefore without much freedom"""
Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years. Only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market. The lack of market institutions means that buyers and sellers operate in small circles.
"Price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world. Small farmers bear the brunt of this risk. In Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually. This kind of market risk is mind-boggling."
"In 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis, to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation. In areas where there were good rains, and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market. This is a tragic example of arrested development, or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks."
"In 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.

"In 1932, three Italian psychiatrists were treating depression in patients who were also epileptics. They noticed that if they had a series of epileptic fits, the depression would very frequently lift. Not only would it lift, but it might never return. They got very interested in producing convulsions, measured types of convulsion."
"In the '30s and '40s, electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective in the treatment of depression. The real difficulty was that there was no way to paralyze muscles. Bones were broken; especially in old, fragile people, you couldn't use it. In the late 1950s, the so-called ""muscle relaxants"" were developed."
"Psychiatrist says electroconvulsive therapy has had a renaissance in the last 10 years. About 10 percent of severe depressives do not respond, regardless of what is done for them, he says. Psychiatrist says he had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy 30 years ago."

People in Uganda are masters of delegation. They delegate tasks that they can't do themselves. They use prepaid cards to top up their mobile phones. They also use them to send money back to the village. They are called 'sente' in Uganda.
"It turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone into an ATM machine. The kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission, and passes the rest over to you in cash. It brings rudimentary banking services to places where there's no banking infrastructure."
"If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff. It boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface, a screwdriver, a toothbrush. It's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at some of the world's most remote areas. He asks: How does this apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets? Defterio: Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK, for those extra three billion people."
"""Connections and Consequences"" is CNN's weekly, offbeat look at what's next in tech. This week, Jarrett looks at the impact of the Internet on the world. He says the world will become more connected as more people have access to the Internet."
"TED's relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen, he says. ""We think of people suffering, of people we love, but at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading"" The bell curve shows 150 controls, and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe."
"Some meditators are able, also, to control their emotional response more than it could be thought. The -0.5 standard deviation is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion. If you are happy about something, you'll go more to the left side."
"We like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while. It's more to say that mind training matters. Just this one example is worth a lot of work. And just, I leave you with the beauty of those looks. And jumping monks of Tibet."
"The Dalai Lama says we all have a deep, profound desire for well-being or happiness. ""Happiness is right now; it's the quality of the freshness of the present moment,"" he says. ""Even the one who hangs himself, somehow, is looking for cessation of suffering,"" he adds."
"Bach used to be a fan of Bach. ""Beautiful chocolate cake: first serving is delicious, second one not so much, then we feel disgust. That's the nature of things,"" he says. ""Happiness, of course, is such a vague word, so let's say well-being"""
"Buddhism says well-being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation. It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment, he says. Even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness -- can be wicked joy, he adds."
"Dalai Lama: ""We can be what we call ""a little paradise,"" and yet, be completely unhappy within"" ""The experience that translates everything is within the mind,"" he says. ""We know a lot of people who, in very difficult circumstances, manage to keep serenity, inner strength, inner freedom, confidence"""
"There are certain states of mind that are conducive to flourishing. There are some which are adverse to this well-being. Anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance, obsessive desire, strong grasping are detrimental to others' happiness. The more those are invading our mind, the more we feel miserable."
" consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it. Consciousness cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy. Behind every single thought there is the bare consciousness, pure awareness. Mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at same time."
"The Dalai Lama says anger is a self-perpetuating process. He says we need to look inward to find the source of our anger. Anger is like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm, he says. It will just cross the sky, like a bird crossing the sky."
"The brain was thought to be more or less fixed. Now, recently, it has been found that it can change a lot. A violinist, who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice, some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain changes a lot, increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections."
"The problem is that we don't know how to reduce CO2 emissions. We need to find a way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. We can do this by reducing emissions from the use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil."
"Sulfuric acid particles would reflect away sunlight and cool the planet. The polar bears will completely lose. There's no adaption. So this problem is absolutely soluble. And it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature."
"Climate scientist: Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2, and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally? The answer seems to be yes. The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight, and you're back to the original climate."
"In the mid-'90s, Ken Caldeira and Marty Hoffart said geo-engineering wouldn't work. Ken went and ran his models, and found that it did. The one new thing is this essay. It's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953."
"Paul Crutzen, who won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry, said we should think about this. I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round in the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere. I was stumped. But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published."
"The photophoretic force can be used to move molecules out of the stratosphere and into the mesosphere. The idea has not been peer reviewed, but so far it seems to be working well. ""It gives us extraordinary leverage to affect the planet,"" says Dr. Michael Bociurkiw."
"Scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece, in their labs. Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment. They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet. They develop science that makes it easier to do."
"CNN's John Defterios says geo-engineering is not a good idea, but it's important. He says it's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method, you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP. ""It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage,"" he says."
"There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much, he says. But it's using this as risk control, not instead of action, he adds. ""It's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off"""
" knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome, and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today. There's very little depth of knowledge on this topic. A very small amount of money would get us some. But I have a lot of reservations."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at some of the arguments against raising oil prices. Sutter: ""Let's not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research"" ""You move from a discipline of engineering, into the discipline of biology,"" Sutter says."
"CNN.com's John Sutter asks readers to think about what they would like to know about a subject. Sutter: If you think of oil, and all hydrocarbons, turned out to be concentrated sunlight. He asks: What is the most important thing you can do to make the world a better place?"
"The talk discusses the potential of bioenergy, focusing on coal bed methane and DNA manipulation for energy production. It emphasizes transitioning from brute force to biological approaches, utilizing biological principles for energy, albeit acknowledging the current dependence on hydrocarbons. The speaker advocates for sustainable energy solutions while acknowledging the temporary reliance on hydrocarbons."
"D.C. Miller: ""We published before knowing that, because we figured it was so beautiful, it's gotta be right!"" Miller: Somewhere in some other planet, orbiting some very distant star, there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are. ""I think there are laws out there, and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well"""
"Theory of quantum mechanics is based on the fact that there is no such thing as a universal law. The theory of quantum physics is that there are no universal laws of nature. The laws of physics, however, are that they can only be expressed in terms of a finite number of particles."
"The history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law, he says. Instead, it's a series of accidents, or chance outcomes, that are there in addition. Getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws is like peeling the skin of an onion."
"Newton found the law of gravity, which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated. Coulomb, in France, found the same law for electric charges. We know a lot about four forces, but those are at very, very small distances."
"Einstein's theory of relativity is based on a set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations. The more and more symmetry you have, the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory. The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents, says Einstein."
Chen Ning Yang and Bob Mills put forward a generalization of Maxwell's equations 50 years ago. They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics -- didn't. But then some of us generalized it further and then it did! And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force.
"Newton said that the force that drew the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon. He said that this principle of nature, consonance, was very remote from the conceptions of philosophers, so he forbore to describe it."
"""You don't need something more to get something more,"" he says. ""Life can emerge from physics and chemistry, plus a lot of accidents"" ""The human mind can arise from neurobiology, the way the chemical bond arises from physics,"" he adds."
"Mark Cutkosky has built a climbing foot-bot inspired by nature. The robot uses shape-deposition manufactured feet and toes. The next step is to make compliant toes, and try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives."
"Scientists have created a blueprint for a fully 3D, dynamic, parameterized contact model of a foot. ""We've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built. We've learned we should distribute control to smart parts. ... Don't put it all in the brain, but put some of the control in tuned feet, legs and even body"""
"CNN's John Sutter shows how cockroaches use their feet to run. Sutter: ""The leg is acting as a foot. The animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot"" ""Without a foot, here's what it does. It doesn't even slow down,"" he says."
"Bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut was discovered by Christina Huffard and filmed by Sea Studios, right here from Monterey. It uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there -- truly extraordinary."
"Robot's foot started off to be quite simple, then it got tuned over time, and ultimately resulted in this half circle leg. No sensing, all the control is built right into the tuned legs. Really simple, but beautiful. The video will show you."
"We can make spines that catch on debris and collapse to pull them out. The crabs don't have spines, so they have a problem in this kind of terrain. This is slowed down 20-fold, and the crab just zooms across that debris."
"Robot RHex has trouble on rails -- on smooth rails, as you see here. So why not add a spine? My colleagues did this at U. Penn. Dan Koditschek put some steel nails on the robot, and here's RHex, now, going over those steel -- those rails."
"The distributed foot, actually, is working more like a paddle. It's actually functioning as a paddle even though it's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid. This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself."
"Insects use hybrid mechanisms that include claws, and spines, and hairs, and pads, and glue, and capillary adhesion. The problem is, there are many, many feet. So to our blueprint, let's attach claws."
"The gecko is a great example of nanotechnology in nature. The secret, which they stick on with, involves their hairy toes. They can run up a surface at a meter per second, take 30 steps in that one second. They attach their feet at eight milliseconds, and detach them in 16 milliseconds."
"The gecko has a billion of these 200-nanometer-sized split ends. They don't stick by glue, or work like Velcro, or they don't work with suction. We discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone. This has inspired the design of the first self-cleaning dry adhesive."
RiSE is the first climbing search-and-rescue robot with no suction or magnets. It's six-legged and has a tail. RiSE's first steps on an incline can be heard in the video below.
"""What is the life of this mouth? In what society [does] this guy live?"" ""What animal species creates this civilization?"" ""The big image is our story, our poetry, our romanticism"" ""There is things to see, there is the big challenge in front of us"""
"Life first appeared four billion years ago, around -- four billion point two? Voice offstage: Four point five. Before, there was this soup, called ""soupe primordiale,"" this first soup -- bloop bloop Bloop -- sort of dirty mud, no life, nothing."

"In the '80s, there was not too much war, like that, it was -- we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized. In this case, people like me are acceptable. We can say, ""It's luxurious time."" But sometimes, like today, we fall so fast to shadow."
"I say that, because, I repeat, nothing exist if it's not in the good rhythym, the rhythym of our beautiful dream, of this civilization. Because we must all work to finish this story. Because the scenario of this. civilization -- about love, progress, and things like that -- it's OK, but. there is so many different, other scenarios of other civilizations."
"Invent a new poetry. The only rule is, we have not to have any idea about the next story. In 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals, you get the shapes of nature."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to Africa to learn more about fractals. He found a pattern in the shape of a circle, which he used to make a model of a village. Defterio: ""It is not unconscious. It is not just a pattern, it is a process"""
"In the Mandara mountains, near the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Mokoulek has a miniature village. The recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales. The cycles of fertility were just like the cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this fractal."
"Eglash: I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture; only the African ones were fractal. Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry. Native American pottery and baskets are circular at the largest scale, rectangular at the smaller scale."
"African fractal geometry wasn't invented until the 1970s. Some African fractals are, as far as I'm concerned, just pure intuition. Some of these things, I'd wander around the streets of Dakar asking people, ""What's the algorithm? What's the rule for making this?"""
"All over Africa, you see this board game called Owari. It's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere. And the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns and would use them strategically. So this is very conscious knowledge."
"The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code, and this was Bamana sand divination. The same divination system is found all over Africa. You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast."
"In the 12th century, Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain. Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you odd. It's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer."
Every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa. The National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools. We've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class.

"phthalmologist tries to square a four-digit number. ""I will not beat you to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right,"" he says. ""We've reached the limits of our calculators -- what's that?"" he asks."
"AB: Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649. AB: Instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me what you're multiplying by. You should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven- digit number."

"The Big Bang is the standard explanation for how the universe came into existence. But new theories suggest that the Big Bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe. According to these theories, there are extra dimensions of space, not just the three we're familiar with."
"The Big Bang is not a point, it's not a finite density of matter. It may be that we live in an endless universe, both in space and in time. There's an experimental way to tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation."
"Writer's parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime in South Africa in the '60s. He says making and testing models of the universe is the best way he has of enjoying and appreciating the universe. ""We need to make the best mathematical models we can, the most consistent ones,"" he says."
"Africa leads the world in deaths from malnutrition, simple infections and birth complications. And here's the number of people in higher education in Africa. It just doesn't exist scientifically, says the former president of South Africa. ""All of the aid that's been given has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet,"" he says."
"The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences was set up in a derelict hotel in Cape Town, South Africa. The idea was to bring together the best students in Africa with the best lecturers in the world. The AIMS is now one of the world's leading institutions in the field of math."
"AIMS is a 24-hour learning environment. The students don't usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m. They emphasize problem-solving, working in groups and maximizing their own potential. The university is based in a hotel in Johannesburg, South Africa."
"AIMS is a non-profit that teaches scientists in Africa. It was founded in Brooklyn, New York, in the 1990s. The school is open to the public and costs less than one-tenth the cost of a U.S. or European school."
"The Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company is like a Costco for superheroes. The store has a villain containment unit, where kids put their parents, and an office. You have to recite the vow of heroism, which you do, if you want to buy anything. The products are all handmade."

"McSweeney's was started in 2000 by a group of friends in Brooklyn. It's now one of the most popular websites in the world. McSweeney: ""We spent months and months renovating this place. We had tables, chairs, computers, everything"""
"At the time, the center was operating behind a pirate supply store. The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students. With one-on-one attention, a student can get one grade level higher, he says."
"McSweeney's was once a pirate supply store, then a publishing company and a tutoring and writing center. Now it's a writing and tutoring center and a writing center for kids and adults. ""There's a lot of cross-pollination. There's no stigma. They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor,"" he says."
"The tutor corps has 1,400 volunteers on its roster. ""The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month, those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder, next to one student, concentrated attention, is going to be absolutely transformative"""
"The group has 1,400 tutors in schools across the U.S. They work in one room, under a teacher's guide, to teach students. ""They were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew,"" he says."

"Between 1914 and 1945, 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict. Even football, which used to be a pleasant pastime, now causes riots where people even die. There's also a great deal, I think, of religious illiteracy around."
"CNN's John Sutter says there is a longing for change in the U.S. Sutter: ""I think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other"" He cites a story from ""The Iliad"" as an example of what spirituality should be about."
"The artist has made more than 1,100 portraits over the course of 300 years. Leonardo da Vinci was a very handsome, even beautiful man, he says. The artist says he couldn't believe his eyes when he first saw Leonardo's ""The Musician"""
"Portraits of Leonardo da Vinci are very similar. They are made in the right order. Leonardo was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made. The only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted is a statue made by Verrocchio, of David."
" Leonardo da Vinci drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything. But no faces? I find that hard to believe. So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700, and looked for male portraits. There are about 120, you see them here."
"Researchers have created 3D models of the brain that can be used to select the areas that produce the pain in chronic pain. The patient can look at 65,000 points of activation per second in his own brain and learn how to control it. They're watching their own brain activation and controlling the pathway that produces their pain."
"In clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients. This is not ""The Matrix."" You can only do this to yourself. Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program, control the hundreds of brain areas."
Scientists will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain. They will do it non-invasively using MRI. The technology will allow them to look at the brain in real time. It will also give them a better idea of how the brain works.
"I'm delighted to be here. I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks. I'd love to talk about this, but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn't need much talking about. I suspect that what I'm interested in won't interest many other people. If you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years, ask a kindergarten teacher."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the future of technology. Sutter: What's going to happen when kids are good at text messaging but never go bowling together? Sutter also talks about one-sided things, like a Klein bottle, which has no volume."

"Historians say Sputnik was the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11. It provoked the missile gap. It began the space race. Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases, and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000."
"Sputnik led to ARPA, and the Internet, and, of course, NASA. Some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik. Support for engineering, math and science -- education in general -- boomed. One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time: ""We are about to create a new planet"""
"Until recently, we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe. Under extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space. We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth, so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets."
"Life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible. This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high. On the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens. This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations within a few hundred light years."

"CNN's Jim Boulden looks at the impact of climate change on the North Pole. He says the ice cap is shrinking, and it could be gone in as little as five years. The U.S. needs to make the transition to a low-carbon economy, he says."
"Earth and Venus are exactly the same size. The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average, on Venus, it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible, and putting it into the atmosphere."
"CNN's John Sutter asks the world to be optimistic about climate change. He says the world is falling behind in its efforts to address the problem. Sutter: ""We have the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis"""
"We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral, to replace taxation on employment, he says. ""We have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis"" ""This is not pie in the sky; this can be done. We need to do it for our own economy,"" he adds."
The project came to an awareness partly because of Australia's drought. The new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto. The software for this I've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free. It's been downloaded over half a million times.

"Music is the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to. Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes. It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things. Music has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital."
"Music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world. Everybody can experience music in a profound way, we just have to make different tools. Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument, like this chandelier."
"The System is a series of books that have the personality of Simon Powers. Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey, resident at Tewksbury Hospital, perform. The opera will be available both online and in public spaces."

"The Large Hadron Collider will send particles around a tunnel near the speed of light. The hope is that if the collision has enough energy, it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions. If it drifts away in the right pattern, this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there."
"Einstein discovered that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself. If this experiment bears fruit, if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began, this will show that the extra dimensions are real."
"Einstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present. But if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun, it causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve. The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment."
"Einstein had already used up space and time, warps and curves, to describe gravity. Kaluza proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of. He imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, and imagined that electromagnetism was in that fourth dimension."
"In 1919, a virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea. He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties -- there might be big, easy-to-see dimensions, but there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions, curled up so small, that we don't see them."
"Superstring theory is a new approach to unify the laws of physics. The theory has nothing to do at first sight with the idea of extra dimensions. But when we study superstring theory, we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form."
"The universe is built up of a huge number of tiny filaments of vibrating energy, vibrating in different frequencies. The different frequencies produce the different particles responsible for all the richness in the world around us. So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrated strings."
"Theory of string theory doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six. It doesn't even work if the universe is small enough to hide the extra dimensions. So where do we go? There are about 20 numbers that really describe our universe."
"String theory suggests that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions. If those numbers had any other values than the known ones, the universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist. This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape -- name isn't all that important."
"In string theory, all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate. If we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns, we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers. This in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is."
"Researchers found that over 500 genes were favorably changed. They turned on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes, and turned off the diseases-promoting genes. These findings are giving many people new hope and new choices, says Dr. Michael Bociurki."
"The last piece of the ATLAS particle accelerator has been completed. It's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created, sometime in the summer this year. The aim of particle physics is to understand what everything's made of, and how everything sticks together."
"The universe was very simple in the first billionth of a second, Hawking says. But as you look back in time, the universe gets hotter and hotter, denser and denser, he says. The Large Hadron Collider is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted."
"When the sun shines, you get copious quantities of these things, called neutrinos, pouring out. You don't feel them, because the weak force is correctly named -- very short range and very weak. The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897, and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino, in the year 2000."
"Physicists accelerate protons -- so, hydrogen nuclei -- around 99.999999 percent the speed of light. It's the Newton's laws, if you want, of particle physics. The equation allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe."
"Higgs particles are carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same. But there's an extra symbol in this equation: H. H stands for Higgs particle. At that speed, they go around that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second. Higgs particles have not been discovered."
"Higgs particles are massless and can pass through a room at the speed of light. When a particle moves through the universe, it can interact with these Higgs particles. It's almost like they get heavy. If that picture's true, then we have to discover those Higgs particle at the LHC."
The LHC is the largest particle accelerator in the world. ATLAS aims to hunt for dark matter and dark energy. The LHC's detectors are essentially digital cameras. The detectors can detect particles as small as EU standard-size people.
"The universe began 13.7 billion years ago, in an immensely hot, dense state, much smaller than a single atom. The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation. After about 400 million years, the first stars formed, and that hydrogen, that helium began to cook into the heavier elements."
The LHC is set to open its doors to the public this summer. It will be the largest particle accelerator in the world. The LHC will be able to detect particles traveling 600 million times faster than the speed of light. It is expected to be open to public use by the end of 2014.

In places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world, the progress has been rather slow."
"In South Africa, it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity. It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost, to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach. We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things, to force us to do things differently."
"The initiative aims to create an end-to-end ecosystem to build hardware and software for schools in Africa.

The Life Box is a box filled with mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores. The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium. The idea is that entomopathogenic fungi attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores.
"I want to reinvent the delivery system, and the use of cardboard around the world, so they become ecological footprints.

Crows are found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America. They're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings. More than half of the human population is living in cities now. The birds are adapting in a pretty unusual way.
"Crows' brains are in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are, scientists say. Crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice, in Sweden. Researchers have been finding more and more that crows are really intelligent."
"Joshua Klein: Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments. In this Japanese city, they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can't manage: drop it among the traffic. The problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over."
"Crows in Sendai City, Japan, are using cars to crack nuts. This is old hat for crows. They learn from their peers and from their enemies. They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges."
" Skinnerian training to shape crows' behavior over four stages. Crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put it in the slot, then get their peanut. When they get really happy about this, we stymie them by giving them a coin."
"Crows can be trained to pick up garbage after stadium events, find expensive components from discarded electronics, or do search and rescue, he says. ""I think we should look a little bit larger. Instead of training crows to do other things, why not train them to do something useful?"" he asks."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about how humans are helping other species survive. Sutter: ""We can find mutually beneficial systems for these species"" ""There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do,"" Sutter says. ""It's not just methane"""
"Livestock is one of the biggest culprits in land degradation, air and water pollution. The time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly. We have to take matters into our own hands by improving our own diet."
"""We can continue to enjoy our food, and we can eat even better,"" he says. ""We can make food more important, and save ourselves by doing so"" ""There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world"""
"CNN's John Sutter says the health crisis isn't caused by global warming. Sutter: Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food, is the problem. He says we don't need animal products, and we certainly don't needs white bread or Coke."
The U.S. government is encouraging people to eat more fruits and vegetables. The government is also encouraging them to eat less of them. The result is that people are eating more junk food and less of the healthy foods they should be eating. The effect is to make people more obese.
"So-called low-fat diets and low-carb diets are not solutions, CNN's John Sutter says. Sutter: There's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year. The word ""locavore"" was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary, he says."
"Every family had a cook, usually a mom. Margarine didn't exist. There were no restaurant chains. Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic. Fancy food was entirely French. There was no snack food, and until the '20s, there was no frozen food."
"Back in those days, before even Julia, there was no philosophy of food. Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food. Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient, because it was an ingredient. In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present."
"The South and West became agricultural hubs, and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland. California produced too much food to ship fresh, so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods. The death of family farms is part of this puzzle, as is the demise of the real community."
"Between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled. Meat consumption increased five-fold. Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes. Soy, corn and cattle became king. Minute Rice is perhaps the stupidest food ever."
"By the '70s, forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients. Many people became fat-phobic. Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like. But mostly they were sold on yogurt."
"By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home. Meat, junk food, cheese: the very stuff that will kill you."
"Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production. 70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth is devoted to raising the animals we'll eat. The game is not over -- it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning."

"An expedition to the Galapagos Islands found giant chimneys, giant tube worms. The only logical explanation was that there were underwater hot springs. The temperature of one of the chimneys was 650 degrees F, hot enough to melt lead. ""We discovered a profusion of life, in a world that it should not exist"""
"Scientists found clams with no mouth, no gut, no digestive system. Their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark. ""We did not know about this life system. We were not predicting it. We stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat,"" he says."
"Two years ago working off Santorini, we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems.

"SB: If there is a struggle for life, such that nearly all of these creatures die, then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were. The principle is you just need those three things -- variation, selection and heredity."
"Dawkins: If something is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. Dawkins: By the time you realize what's happening, the child is a toddler, up and causing havoc. The information that is copied, he called the replicator, selfishly copies."
"The science of memetics is much maligned, much misunderstood, much feared. But a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition. Information that we copy from person to person, by imitation, by language, by talking, by telling stories, by wearing clothes."
"A meme is that which is imitated, or information which is copied from person to person. A meme is not equivalent to an idea. We're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box, and we can't push it back in."
"SB: Some of them will be copied because they're good, or true, or useful, or beautiful. But some, it's quite hard to tell why. SB: I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam."
"The memes are all trying to get copied -- trying, in inverted commas -- i.e., that's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will. They're using you and me as their propagating, copying machinery, and we are the meme machines. It gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human."
"In ""The Meme Machine,"" I called it memetic drive. As the memes evolve, they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving. This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains, that we like religion, and music, and art."

I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance."
"The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion. The question is, how is it going to help their development? It's a huge opportunity for transformational development. Will it be taken?"
"In the short run, everything goes up. But in the long run, most societies have ended up worse than if they'd had no resource booms at all. The critical issue is the level of governance, the initial level of economic governance, when the resourcebooms accrue."
"With bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't. It's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil. So I thought, well, maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion. Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy."
"Nigeria needs checks and balances on resource extraction, says U.S. President Barack Obama. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for international standards to be set on the issue.

"This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq as taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos. The photos are spread out over a longer period of time. The figure at the bottom, approximately ten photos per photographer, is a lie."
"In bigger systems, the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer, so the imbalance increases. If you exclude 99 percent of the group effort, you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos. The costs of running the institution mean that you cannot take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame."
"The tension here is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle. The institutional model always pushes leftwards, treating these people as employees. The question is not, is Psycho Milt a good employee? It's, do you want that photo? Yes or no."
"Many institutions are still in denial, but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining. Steve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft, was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago, and he said, ""Oh, this business of thousands of programmers contributing to Linux, this is a myth"""
"Meetup was founded so users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities. Meetup is the platform, but the value here is in social infrastructure. In the suburbanized, dual-income United States, stay-at-home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local, small-scale neighborhoods."
"In the U.S., journalists are being jailed for not disclosing their sources. This is against the backdrop of the rise of Web-based journalism. The shield law is becoming more and more incoherent, says John Defterios. ""It's a revolution in that it's a whole new way of doing things,"" he says."
Gell-Mann: Modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures. Linguists in the U.S. and Western Europe mostly try to stay away from long-distance relationships. Gell-mann: How far back does modern language go?
"The machine was built at the Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s. Julian Bigelow was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off. The first person to really explain that was Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651, explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing."
"Von Neumann created the qubit, a computer capable of only two ideas. Such a computer would open up universes, which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments. The Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there, really should be down there."
"This year, CNN's John Sutter tells the story of the birth of digital computing. Sutter: RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know, televisions are the future, not computers. The essentials were all there -- all the things that make these machines run."
"The original microprocessor was built using radio vacuum tubes. The memory was in cathode ray tubes, very, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. The input and the output was by teletype tape at first. The machine was cloned at 15 other places around the world."
"Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud, doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components. The ""Graph'g-Beam Turn On"" is the -- as far as I know -- the first digital bitmap display, 1954."
"IBM's MANIAC calculator ""lost its memory"" when the power went off. The machine was running 24 hours a day, mainly running bomb calculations. The machines were working under tough conditions. They ran all night, complained about the manuals, then solved the problem."
"Marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there. The high speed was 16 kilocycles, that's slow speed. The first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952, was Mike, the first atomic bomb. ""I know when I'm licked,"" Marston says."
"John von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos to work on all these problems. Dr. Barricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life. He was trying to see if, in this artificial universe -- he was a viral-geneticist."
"Von Neumann created the first artificial organisms in the 1950s. He wanted to show that computers could evolve into living organisms. Von Neumann: ""There's really no difference between what I was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago"""
"Punch cards are the code for a universe that has not yet been fully realized. They are being used to help scientists understand the nature of the universe. The universe is 10,000 million times the size it was when the punch cards were created."
"Von Neumann envisioned self-reproducing machines, he says. America has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on Earth. One out of four people in prison are Americans, imprisoned in our country, he adds."
"I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms, and in the actual print of this piece, each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge. I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who die from cigarette smoking. More than 400,000 people die in the United States every year from smoking."
"1,100 Americans have died from cigarette smoking every day since 2001. More than 700,000 children in the U.S. aged 18 and under begin smoking every year. 213,000 Vicodin pills have been abused and misused in the United States."
"One-third of all drug overdoses in the U.S. are prescription medications. 384,000 women, American women, last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery. The only plastic surgery that is more popular is liposuction, and most of that is done by men."

"CNN's John Defterios meets scientists at the University of California, San Diego. They are studying the force of a single strand of human hair. The scientists are trying to figure out how the hairs hold together. Defterio: ""We know from working on animals that's exactly what you don't want to do"""
"Researchers are working to create the first synthetic, self-cleaning, dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this technology, including Nike. The Internet is already having eyes and ears, you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands."
"Evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer, he says. ""You need to discover the general principles of nature, and then use these analogies when they're advantageous"" ""We discovered that two-, four-, six- and eight-legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move"""
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the bipedal nature of animals. Sutter: ""We got some of the best mathematicians in the world from Princeton to work on this problem"" ""It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics,"" he says."
"Human technologies have tended to be large, flat, with right angles, stiff, made of metal. Whereas nature tends to be small, and curved, and it bends and twists, and has legs instead, and appendages. As human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature, then nature can become a much more useful teacher."
"The Stanford Shape Deposition Manufactured has created a robot with springy legs. The robot can run over obstacles three times the height of the animals it is testing. It can also leap into the air, and has aerial phases when it does it."
"Robert Full: The challenge of looking at nature's designs -- and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it. This is the RHex, making its first outing in a demo. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system, with very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal."
"Geckos can run up a wall at a meter a second, 15 steps per second, and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this? They have bizarre toes. They have toes that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out, and then peel off the surface, like tape. This peeling inspired iRobot to build Mecho-Gecko robots."
The Mecho-Gecko uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to peel its toes. It can do this in 14 milliseconds. The gecko can climb autonomously. It is the inspiration for iRobot's Mecho Geckos.
"If you zoom in 270 times, you'll see it looks like a rug. And if you blow that up, you see there are hairs there, tiny hairs. If you look carefully, those tiny hairs have striations. So, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly."

"The film, ""Sputnik,"" opens in New York in two weeks. The conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound. He depends, for his power, on his ability to make other people powerful. The music profession doesn't see it that way."
"I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people. I wanted to know whether I was doing that. People in my orchestra said, ""Ben, what happened?"" That's what happened. I have a definition of success. It's about how many shining eyes I have around me."

"The pianist was once playing with an impulse on every note. The nine-year-old pianist put an impulse in every four notes. The 10-year old, on every eight notes, one impulse on the whole phrase. The 11- year-old, on one impulse in the phrase."
"I was working with this young pianist, and said, ""The trouble with you is you're a two-buttock player. You should be a one- buttock player."" And suddenly, the music took off. The audience gasped when they heard the difference. He was the president of a corporation in Ohio."
People who never listen to classical music are in three groups. The first group is the tone-deaf. The second group is those who don't listen to music at all. The third group is people who are just not interested in classical music.
"CNN.com's John Sutter talks to CNN.com about his new series, ""Music, Music, Music"" Sutter: ""I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room, downstairs and in Aspen, will come to love and understand classical music"""
"The composer says the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you, but because of us. Composers know that if they want sad music, they just play those two notes, he says. ""Every time you hear classical music, you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses"""
"Chopin didn't want to reach the E there, because what will have happened? It will be over, like Hamlet. The critics sitting in the back row there, they have to have an opinion, so they say, ""Hamlet is a procrastinator"""
"The Chopin piece is like an experiment, he says. It's the same with the Chopin. He's just about to reach the E, and he says, ""Oops, better go back up and do it again."" So he does it again. He gets excited."
"""This is about the long line. This is about vision"" ""I'm going to play it all the way from B to E,"" he says. ""I don't want to stop here. I want to keep going"" ""This is a long, long line,"" he adds. ""It's about the vision"""

"One Laptop per Child is a nonprofit that provides computers to children in need. The organization is launching three new languages: Squeak, Logo and a third, that I've never even seen before. One Laptop Per Child was founded by former President Bill Clinton."
The U.N.'s not going to be our partner if we're profit making. The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive -- you can get the best people in the world. It allows you to team up with people. It was getting its power in a different way.
"Design matters for a number of reasons. The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product. It wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody -- you know, good design is very important. The mesh network, it'll become commonplace."
"In Ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard standard because there's no market. English is by far the minority. Latin is relatively rare, too. These can talk to each other. They're not going to be near another laptop, so you have to nail these onto a tree."
"Ethiopia is rolling out the keyboard to six countries. The first six countries are big, rich, big countries, one of them is not so big, but it's rich. In each case, the head of state said he would do it, he'd do a million. The camel smells were unbelievable."
"Laptop tender had nothing in it that related to us, nothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power, but just a vanilla laptop proposal. And guess what? We won it hands down. When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay, the first 100,000, went to OLPC."

"The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body. The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have. We do have one unintentional dancer actually, the last thing I'm going to show you. He's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say."
"A new way of simulating the human body is being developed at Oxford University. The idea is to simulate the nervous system of a person. It's not quite there yet, but we're working on it, says researcher. The technology will be used to make computer games and movies."
Researchers used artificial evolution to simulate the nervous system that controls walking in humans. They created a neural network based on that part of the spine that we have in our spine. The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work. The results were surprising.
"The technology is simulating humans. It's simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body. At the beginning, it can't walk at all, but it will get better and better over time. After generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over."
"The first thing the team had to work on was to create the human body, basically. It's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc., but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization, so you can concentrate on the movement."
"It's one of the most successful games of all time. The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it. The character now has motor skills in the upper body -- nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one. It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll."
"At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games. But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive. This is the first time the public sees this as well, because we have been in stealth mode."
Virtual stuntmen are being developed for film studios and games developers. The first product will be released in a couple of weeks. The virtual stuntman looks the same and is always reacting to his surroundings. The technology is expected to be available in the next few months.
The characters are actually not real characters. They are a graphical visualization of a character in midair. The realism we're achieving with this is good enough to be used in films. An animation studio in London is using our software and experimenting with it right now.
"This is a real-life version of a stunt where a stuntman falls off a cliff. The stuntman is being controlled by a computer, which then animates the fall in real-time. This is the first time we've shown how this technique can be used in real time."
"The technology could be used in video games, sports games and film. The first thing is going to be virtual stuntmen. Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntman. It took about altogether just two hours, pretty much, to create the simulation."
"Technology could be used to help surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy. The degree of interactivity you're going to get is totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now. I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave."

"Scientists hope to find life in the universe in the next 10 years. If they do, they will be able to spread out into space. This could lead to the creation of a new planet, Europa, to live on. This would be a huge step forward for the future of science."
"Most of the real estate in the solar system is very cold and very far from the Sun. The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate, but not very large. Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter, where we see a very level ice surface. It's probably the most likely place for life to originate."
"Life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years. It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface, just as it did on the Earth. If life could be established out there, it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight."
"Life on the surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa, is unlikely, but it could have come, says Neil deGrasse Tyson. The surface of Europa is 25 times fainter than it is in the United States, he says. Tyson: If there's life there, it would have to have a thick skin to protect itself from losing water."
"The Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable. The universe is full of all kinds of wonderful things radiating in the radio spectrum, much brighter than the Sun. So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life, which I'm talking about, on cold objects."
"Life on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live on a cold surface, must be provided with reflectors. The further out you go in this, away from the Sun, the more powerful this reflection will be. So, in fact, you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth."
The poem was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in 1896. Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies. But love isn't always a happy experience. Almost nobody gets out of love alive.
"Researchers have put 37 people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner. They found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area. The same brain region is active also when you feel the rush of cocaine."
"Researchers found activity in the brain region associated with intense romantic love. The brain system for wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus becomes more active when you can't get what you want. In this case, life's greatest prize: an appropriate mate."
"Researchers found activity in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses. The brain region becomes active when you're willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses. When you've been rejected in love, you're engulfed with feelings of romantic love."
"""Romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on Earth"" ""There's not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything that comes along"" ""If you're stuck in a box, you're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with"""
"""Love at first sight"" is a real phenomenon, says Dr. Andrew Wexler. He says the brain area associated with love is still active 25 years later. ""You can know every single ingredient in a chocolate cake, and then you can still feel that joy"""
"Psychologists don't know why we fall in love with one person rather than another. A new dating site asks people to rate their levels of dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone. 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in the U.S., and 600,000 in 33 countries."
"Women get intimacy from face-to-face talking. Men get it from side-by-side doing. Faulkner said, ""The past is not dead, it's not even past"" ""Love is in us. It's deeply embedded in the brain,"" he says."
"After 1,300 years, these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb. The ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote, he said, there's every activity under heaven. There's a time to be born, and there's atime to die. Our challenge is to understand each other."

"CNN's John Sutter has spent his life working on extremely miserable people. Sutter: ""We can measure different forms of happiness"" The one way in which they differ: they're extremely social, Sutter says. ""Hollywood"" sense of happiness is happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer"""
"The first happy life is the pleasant life, says Seligman. The second is a life of engagement: a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure. The third is the meaningful life, which includes family, friends, work and play."
"The pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is about 50 percent heritable. Positive emotion habituates. American women said to Len, when he dated them, ""You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost."""

"Two million years ago, Homo erectus lived in a region of Africa known as the Great Rift Valley. It is believed that the area is the only place in the world where the remains of this species can still be found. The area is thought to have been covered by a river that ran through it."
"When I was 12, a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side of Lake Turkana, when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus. We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today. I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya."
"Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe. He had a body very similar to our own, and he was on the threshold of becoming human. Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago. We evolved essentially from an African stock."
Human ancestors only survive on planet Earth for about a million years at a time. We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors. We've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome; and recently even created synthetic life.

"CNN's John Sutter spent nine days in Barrow, Alaska, photographing an Eskimo whaling camp. Sutter's new project is called ""The Whale Hunt"" Sutter: ""I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story"""
"""The Whale Hunt"" is a collection of 3,214 photographs taken by the photographer. The photographer used the photos to create a framework for the story. ""I'm interested in collecting my own stories, stories from the Internet, and then stories from life, which is kind of a new area of work,"" he says."
"This is the Arctic Ocean, and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later. You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story. The Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same, so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically."

"CNN's John Sutter looks at the impact of the World Trade Center in New York City. Sutter: ""It's like being the last high-school student in the world to go to school"" He says it's an opportunity for the U.S. to rethink its relationship with the rest of the world."
"Daniel Libeskind was one of six people invited to participate in a competition to design the new World Trade Center in New York. The competition was a response to a series of failures by previous architects, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: ""I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the difference between the two styles of architecture. Sutter: ""It's in our nature to go back and forth between these two types of architecture"" Sutter asks: ""What would you rather do? Go back to the old way?"""
" architectural practice SHoP is working on a large-scale camera obscura in a public park. The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution, has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings, traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings."
CNN's John Defterios and Deborah Patton are joined by a team of young architects in New York. The architects used a computer program to create a model of a sand dune and a beach cabana. They then used a lathe to turn the model into a set of instructions for building the cabana and dune.
"Dune-scape is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street. They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks, building it, including all of the parts, manufactured. They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York."
"David Rockwell's work is not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do. His Nobu restaurant in New York is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition. His Pod restaurant, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is white."
"The World Trade Center is a symbol of how technology has transformed culture, says TED Talk host. It's all about sensuality, comfort, comfort and comfort in places that you wouldn't have felt good before, he says. TED Talk: Small-scale architecture can't really happen without a conversation about this, he adds."
"The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better, says Google's Larry Page. ""It will know us, and that's good. And again, the price of that will be transparency,"" he says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the ""one machine"" that is the Internet. Sutter: ""There's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge"" He says the Web is the ""OS"" of the Internet, and all screens look into the One."
"The Internet, the Web as we know it, is already less than 5,000 days old. And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable. It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted. And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made."
"The Web is running at seven terabytes per second, compared to the Library of Congress' twenty terabytes. A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain. By 2040, the total processing power of this machine will exceed a totalprocessing power of humanity, in raw bits."
"Every screen in the world is looking into the one machine. The second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud, and you're kind of touching the cloud with this. And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it."
"The Web is like a black hole that's sucking up everything into it. Every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it some little sliver of Web-ness and connection. We have, basically, an Internet of things. Everything is connected to the Web."
"In 5,000 days, all this stuff has come. The media wants to be liquid. So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value, the value's in the uncopiable things. The more you have, the more you get."
"In the first stage of the Internet, computers were connected by links. In the second stage, pages were resolved into links. The third stage is where we link the data. ""If I told you it was all coming for free, you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming,"" he says."
"Every person, every item will have a something that will be very specific, and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item. Every idea is basically being supported -- or every item, or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web. So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person."
"A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph -- we're trying out what we want to call this thing. But what's it's doing is sharing data. So you have to be open to having your data shared. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages, they are things."
"If you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history. The closer it is, the better. ""I am open, and being transparent to that will require total transparency,"" he says. ""We're so dependent on this that I don't even try to remember things"""
"The brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have. The brain uses as much energy as your laptop computer: it's just 10 watts. So what we are doing with computers with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses, the brain is doing with theEnergy consumed by your laptop."
"The brain is a huge network of neurons. They send pulses of electricity to each other. This process is called a synapse. In the brain, this process is very dynamic and adaptive. It's not like in the human brain, where it's very rigid."
"CNN's Jim Boulden explains how computers work. He says the devices we use are similar to the ones we use in our brains. They are called transistors, he says, and they work in a similar way to neurons. The difference is that the transistors are smaller, so they can move more quickly."
"In 2007, a transistor was big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side. In 2015, the transistor is going to become so small, that it corresponds to only one electron at a time. The current will turn on and off at random, even when it's supposed to be on."
The way brains work is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons. So you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network. The way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern.
Scientists have created a chip that can send images back to the brain. The process is similar to that used to stream video over the Internet. The chip was designed by a team of neurobiologists at the University of Cambridge. It will soon be as easy to ask a computer a question as asking a person.
"When Kareem moves his head to the right, you will see this blue activity there; it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image, that's where it's going from dark to light. And you also see this yellow activity, which represents region where contrast is decreasing; it'sGoing from light to dark. And these four types of information -- your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it, and 900,000 of those fibers send these four kinds of information."
"Kwabena: ""Why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?"" ""This is a steel drum here that has been modified, and that's what happens when you put Africa in a computer"" ""We can dream like everybody else,"" he says."
The secret to productivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you. Origami revolves around crease patterns. They have to obey four simple laws. The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting.
"The laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin. They govern all of chemistry, all of life and all of history. In origami, to obey these laws, we can take simple patterns and make them complex. The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures."
"Most people think they know what origami is, but they don't know what it means. We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure. From that, I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject, a flap for every leg."
"How to make a single flap. Fold a square in half, fold it in half and fold it again, until it gets long and narrow, and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap. There's other ways of making flaps."
"In the 1990s, origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles. So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles, you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. That gives you the folds. Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base. And it's so simple that a computer could do it."
"A computer program called TreeMaker calculates the crease pattern of a stick figure. The program is free and runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows. It can be used to fold insects, spiders, things with legs and wings, and antennae."
"Toes have become an origami meme, because everyone's doing it. And you can do more than just insects. Everything you'll see here, except the car, is origami. And sometimes you create high art, and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work."
" origami has applications in medicine, in science, in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more. One of the earliest was this pattern, this folded pattern, studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer. Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger."
"In the twentieth century, a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along, and he created tens of thousands of new designs. The Livermore engineers, wanting to make use of the work of dead people, or perhaps live origamists, said, ""Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing"""
"The Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail, and you can see that the sail expands out. The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination, but small for the journey. The algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags."
"The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs. The thing is, that this often happens in math and science. When you get math involved, problems that you solve for aesthetic value only, or to create something beautiful, turn out to have an application in the real world."
"Photography holds a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world. Images emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment in time. Let's just start by looking at some great photographs. (Laughter)"
"Photograph taken by Dr. Euan Mason in New Zealand last year. The Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic. To be a great photojournalist, you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you."
"Photographer Nick Nichols traveled to Chad to take photos of the wild animals. The animals include lions, elephants, hippos, and more. The images were taken with a point-and-shoot camera, which can be used to tell a story."
"CNN's John Defterios returns to San Francisco with a story that touched our audiences deeply. The story is about poachers who killed 20 elephants for their ivory tusks. The elephants were tracked by a group of park rangers, who were able to recover the ivory."
"For the first time in history, more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments. Most of that growth is not in the cities, but in the slums that surround them. Sometimes the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture."
Randy Olson takes a look at the impact of over-fishing on the world's oceans. He also shows the effects of war on the health of the nation's soldiers. And he shows the impact on the environment as a result of the conflict in Iraq.
"Penguins are one of the most dangerous animals in the world. They are often captured and taken to the U.S. where they are treated for their injuries. The animals are then sent back to the wild, where they can breed and mate."
"CNN's John Sutter meets a 12-foot-long female penguin. She brings the penguins to him, alive, and drops them in front of him. Sutter: ""She's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph, but she's pretty significant in size"""
"CNN's John Sutter takes a look at the evidence for dark matter in the universe. Sutter: ""I believe that photography can make a real connection to people, and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today"""
Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space; they tend to cluster. Galaxies in the Coma cluster are moving at extremely high speeds. The galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.
"There appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter. ""I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK, to try to remind you that it's there,"" he says."
Physicists have been turning their attention to the universe on the largest scale. They extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here. Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy? Yes! The rays would lie on a cone.
"CNN's Jim Boulden shows how to make a model of the universe. He uses a wineglass with a hole in the bottom to create an image of a galaxy. Then, he shows how the image is distorted by the lens of the telescope."
"Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope. The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session."
Physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down. The startling answer was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago. No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.
"""There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,"" Hawking says. ""Dark matter and dark energy are completely different things,"" he adds. ""We don't have any, you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy,"" he says."
"Dark matter is a very weakly interacting, new particle. It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum, which is what we use to detect things. Dark matter particles can come through the building, through the Earth -- they're so non-interacting. The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator, will be turning on later this year."
"New physics could be missing energy, so it will be hard to tell the difference. Dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale. Ground-based telescopes are being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy."

"Glenn Gould died 25 years ago this year. Gould was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience, and felt like a performing monkey. He stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work."
"Glenn Gould's specialty was playing Bach. Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about, one in mono, and one in stereo. Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. The theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line."

"Molecular programmers are trying to build computers out of DNA. They are using DNA because it is cheap and easy to use. The question is, how does a program know when to stop? And how do you know if a program will ever stop?"
"Computer scientist Craig Venter asked, how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism? How many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone? These are big questions in computer science. Almost -- many of them are impossible."
"Ned Seeman: ""We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix"" ""We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples,"" he says. ""The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle"""
The process is similar to folding a piece of paper into an origami-like shape. The DNA strands are mixed with water to form a pattern. The pattern is then drawn on the surface of the water to create the shape of a human hair.
"A graduate student in China, Lulu Qian, did a great job. She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami. You can make patterns as well as shapes, OK? And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA."
"DNA origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size of those in a normal computer. The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works. The fact is that it does not scale. We're going to turn to another technology, called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles."
"Scientists have developed a way to turn DNA into a counting program. The program can read off binary numbers five, six and seven. A small mutation can take a two-wing fly and make it a four-wingfly. The study doesn't tell how babies do it, however."
"Venter: ""You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes ... can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger"" ""You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get 96 rather than 32,"" Venter says."

"The worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth. But they have two types of gill structures. One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water, another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria. The average depth is about two miles."
"DG: ""These animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can"" On one of the last dive series, we counted 200 species in these areas -- 198 were new, new species. Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea."
Bill Lange and David Gallo travel to the Pacific Ocean in search of hydrothermal vents.

"Lange: ""There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many, many times over"" Lange: ""If you're in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off, you have a 90 percent chance of not making it"""
"If you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon, you have 10 to 20 minutes to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up. Within 24 hours, lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds, and it's mostly in this particular direction -- it's going northeast."
"In 2008, there isn't one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster. The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out, and not going into harm's way. The difference between knowing information of what you're going to do personally and not knowing information can save your life."
"Jack Geiger: Don't stare at the light flash, if you can. The farther you are away in distance, the longer it is in time from the initial blast. You want to get under something so that you're not injured or killed by objects, if that's at all possible."
"After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union, we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view. We began to counter-proliferate, and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of 21,000. It's a very difficult number to deal with."
"CNN's John Sutter looks back at the early days of nuclear weapons. He says the U.S. was aware of the threat of nuclear war. Sutter: ""We were totally dependent on this amazing acronym, MAD"" ""MAD"" stands for mutually assured destruction."
Less than 2 percent of Americans had a bomb shelter in their house. FEMA had a plan to evacuate the U.S. in case of a Soviet attack. The plan was to force the Soviets to re-target their nuclear weapons. The idea was to take out sites where people were going.
"In the nuclear age, civil defense programs were disconnected from what we'd see in all-out nuclear war. The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the Manhattan Project. When the Soviet Union broke up, we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States."
"From 1993 through 2006, the International Atomic Energy Agency documented 175 cases of nuclear theft. The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about 1,300, at the low end, to about 2,100 metric tons. More than 100 megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure Russian facilities."
"There's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know-how to actually make a nuclear weapon. There's detailed information on how to assemble anuclear weapon from parts. The third element of the nuclear terror threat is that, who would actually do such a thing? They are very dedicated and committed."
The U.S. is not prepared for any kind of major attack. The level of the preparedness that the United States has achieved since 9/11 of '01 is unbelievably inadequate. Seven million ship cargo containers come into theUnited States every year. Five to seven percent only are inspected.
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the possibility of a nuclear bomb being used in the U.S. Sutter: ""We have all the elements of that happening"" He says a lot of people in the intelligence community think it's almost inevitable.

"CNN's John Defterios is in Alexandria, Egypt. He is working with the Library of Alexandria on a new way to print books. He says the idea of printing on demand is not new, it's just that it's easier to do now."
"The $100 e-book reader is the equivalent of a 300-dot printer. It can be used to scan books, but it's also used to read them. The device was developed by a group of students at the University of California, Los Angeles."
"Librarian: ""I'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it"" The Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books -- about 300,000 now. Chinese did over a million, and Egyptians are about 30,000."
"The University of Toronto is scanning books for 10 cents a page. The cost of scanning a million books would be about 750 million dollars. The University has eight scanning centers in three countries. The Getty is moving their books to the UCLA, and scanning their out-of-copyright books."
"The library is scanning about 15,000 books a month. It's also going back over microfilm and getting that online. The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal, he says. But it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise, at least for the out of print and out of copyright."
"There are about two to three million disks having been published. It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online, if you're doing things in volume. The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing as long as nobody made any money."
"We have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did, up on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material. We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day. It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen. We've found lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day."
"CNN put a week of worldwide TV coverage of 9/11 on its website. CNN's coverage included Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC. The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars feeding 30 million children a year."
"The richest country spends less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools. In L.A., it's 56 cents. The way we got here is because of big agribusiness. We, as a country, should be ashamed."
"10 companies control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in the U.S. 70 percent of all antibiotics consumed in America are consumed in animal husbandry. We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones. We, as a nation, have to start consuming, growing and feeding our children food that's not chock-full of chemicals."
"Every one of us, and our children, consumes what would equal a five-pound bag -- those bags you have at home. The USDA cannot be seen as the be-all and end-all of what we feed our kids and what's allowed."
"In less than 200 years, we've gone from being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers to less than 2 percent of farmers. We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers -- 2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers. School districts spend 500 dollars a year feeding a child."
40 or 45 percent of all school-aged children could be insulin-dependent within a decade. Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year marketing non-nutrient foods to kids. They spend 500 dollars for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn't eat.
"The government commodifies food, and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply. The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can, it came frozen in a box. The USDA allows all of this stuff."
"""We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food,"" she says. ""There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush. There's a lot of stuff we can do"" ""We have no high-fructose corn syrup, no trans fats, no processed foods"""
"""We can't keep serving kids processed crap, full of chemicals, and expect these are going to be healthy citizens,"" he says. ""You're not going to get the next generation, or the generation after, to be able to think like this if they're not nourished"" ""I get up at 4 a.m. every day and go cook the food for the kids,"" he adds."
"Children's food choices make a big difference in their health, author says. One out of every four meals is eaten in fast food, one in a car and one in front of a TV or computer, he says. ""We have to make kids understand that their food choices makes a big Difference,"" he adds. ""Where is socialization? Where is discussion?"" he asks."
"""We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren't breakfast,"" she says. ""The way the government commodifies food, the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools"" ""It has to be so much a part of them that they really get it,"" she adds."
"""We need 40-minute lunches ... and lunches that are time-appropriate"" ""It's not all about food; it's also about kids getting exercise"" ""I had 90 employees. Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could. And, you know, I'm not that better off now"""
"I think if we're going to fix this, one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program. There was just a big study done, and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning. That is not lunchtime."

"How many people should there be? I think it should be about 100 million or maybe 500 million. Most people are about 60 inches high or more, and there's these cube laws. If you make them this big, by using nanotechnology, I suppose -- then you could have a thousand times as many."

"People live twice as long as chimpanzees almost, and nobody lives more than 120 years. ""We're not responsible for the consequences of what we're doing now, are we? Like all this complaint about clones,"" he says. ""It's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making"""
"If people live 200 or 1,000 years, then we can't let them have a child more than about once every 200 or 1000 years. And yet two random people will mate and have this child, and both of them have some pretty rotten genes. And so there won't be any workforce. And things are going to get worse."
"The future of psychology is to classify types of predicaments, types of situations and types of obstacles. Some problems are good for neural nets; we know that others, neural nets are hopeless on. Genetic algorithms are great for certain things; I suspect I know what they're bad at, and I won't tell you."
"Passion, integrity and experience are the most important things to convey to a VC. ""If you're not passionate, why should anyone else be, or put money into your company if you's not passionate about it?"" says entrepreneur and investor Richard Branson."
"You have to know your market, your area. You have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going. You've got to be able to convince us that you have developed a team that has all those factors in it, or else you can."

"The first question a VC is looking for is what is the single most important thing when pitching a new business idea. ""I want to know validation -- not just what you're telling me, but that somebody or something else out there says this makes sense"" ""And then, I'm looking for the upside; I need a believable upside. That's two parts; it's got to be upside and believable"""
"If you can't do a presentation, how can you run a company, he says. The best way to do this is to look at our betters, people who have done this before, he adds. ""It's a very tricky path. But if you can do it, it works really well"""

"Most VC pitches, angel pitches, are about 15 minutes, most should be less than half an hour. People's attention span, after 18 minutes, begins to drop off. The screen should come up behind you and supplement what you're doing, instead of replace you."
"""The Blank Slate"" argues that elite art and criticism in the 20th century disdained beauty, pleasure, clarity, insight and style. David Frum: We have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex. He says studies of parenting on which this advice is based are useless because they don't control for heritability."
"Researchers find that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run, but in part by their culture. The sciences of human nature are going to upset various dogmas, careers and deeply-held political belief systems. The choice is whether certain facts about humans, or topics, are to be considered taboos, forbidden knowledge or explored honestly."
"Anthropologist Donald Brown says there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions that can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures. Brown: Genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured. He says studies of identical twins separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities."
"The book is called ""The Blank Slate,"" based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate. All of its structure comes from socialization, culture, parenting, experience. The concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness."
"The Blank Slate is a book about controversial topics. The author discusses issues such as homosexuality, race, religion and the arts. The book has received 80-odd reviews on Amazon.com. It is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99 (about $25)"
"The arts are frequently said to be in decline in the second half of the 20th century. ""There is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts"" ""By any standard they have never been flourishing to a greater extent"""
"By any economic standard, the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing. The only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres. The beauty and pleasure in art -- probably a human universal -- were considered saccharine or kitsch."
"In a new book, David Perry explores the relationship of design and happiness. Perry: ""There was visual art without beauty, literature without narrative and plot, poetry without meter and rhyme"" ""Money does not make me happy"" appeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine four years ago."

"CNN's Richard Quest says Islam was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks. Islam is a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense, Quest says. Quest: Many in the Muslim world disagree with bin Laden in his application, but agree that Islam is the answer."
"""Islam is a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals,"" he says. ""I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to,"" he adds. ""They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense"""
"Islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation, says Frida Ghitis. Ghitis: Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner. She says the hopeful response derives from recognizing that Islam and democracy can be manipulable."
"Many Muslims disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly. Many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam are compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice. Democracy, as a type of politics, is a technology for the control and deployment of power."
"CNN's Fareed Zakaria: ""We are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world"" Zakariya: ""Many sincerely believing Muslims do not want to compromise those values"" ""It will be transformative of Islam as well,"" he says."
"CNN's Fareed Zakaria: The war has risks for the model that I'm describing. It's possible that as a consequence of a war, many Muslims will conclude that the U.S. is not the kind of place they want to emulate, he says. Zakaria says it is crucial for people who care about these issues to make sure they exercise their preferences."
"Tully is a new concert hall being built in Salt Lake City, Utah. The hall's walls are covered in a resin material to create a special lighting effect. It's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage. Tully is due to open in 2015."
"Water is pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles, 35,000 of them. The weather station is on the structure. It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, dew point, and processes this data in a central computer."
"The work is ""a spectacular anti-circumstance in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head,"" says the artist. ""We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense, and maybe share our kind of sensibility,"" he says."
"In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work from the '80s and '90s. The work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective, and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show. The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space."
"Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller. The drill pierces the dry wall, leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location. Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall. The wall was made into an increasingly unstable element."
"The Institute of Contemporary Art is located on Boston's waterfront. The building incorporates the site, but it dispenses it in very small doses. The original intention of this space was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out."
The Mediatheque is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building. The public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or curated artworks off the web. It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.
"Tully Hall is a multi-purpose hall. The walls are made of absorptive surface, half absorptive, half reflective. It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound, like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles."
"Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming. It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in, that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them. I'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization."

"Clive Sinclair is recognized as being the father of video games in Europe. His games include ""The Terminator,"" ""Aladdin,"" the ""Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles"" and ""Tortugas Ninja"" The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business."
"43 percent of gamers are female. 83 percent of games don't have any mature content. ""World of Warcraft"" makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions. It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer, making the publisher about another 275 million dollars."
"A player in a game called ""Project Entropia"" actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars. This purchase included mining and hunting rights, ownership of all land on the island, and a castle with no furniture included. The market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually."
"Video game graphics are getting so ridiculously better, says the creator of the popular video game 'Fortnite' 'This is happening in your local cities too, you're probably just not aware of it,' he says. 'I want you to try and think about what games could look like 10 years from now,' he adds."
"The video game industry is on a ""curve that we're going to continue to get better,"" says game designer. Video games are about emotion, purpose, meaning, understanding and feeling, he says.

"Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap, says author. They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive, downloaded, streaming, HD reality. Play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard, fly a plane, drive a nine-second quarter mile."
"The beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics, the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound. It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional. A well-designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience."
"Video games have allowed for a true overlap in stimuli, he says. As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities. He says some instincts may be innate, most are learned, and all of them are hardwired into brains."

CNN.com's John Sutter talks about the rise of Google's search engine. Sutter says the site has become a way for people to find each other. He says it's a new way to connect with people who want to talk to each other about issues.
"Technorati tracks how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs. A weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than one that has few links. At any given time, on any given page on the Web, you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page?"
"Google's new tools are plumbing the depths of the global brain. The question is, are you finding out something new? The key thing in terms of these new tools is that they are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream. Google does the Google Zeitgeist, which looks at search requests."
"CNN's John Sutter did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection. Sutter: Dan Dennett, Steven Pinker, Gary Bauer and L. Ron Hubbard are in the top five. Satter: Britney Spears is in the middle of the pack."
"Reagan's book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density, of largely urban density. The question now is, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging in the overall Web ecosystem, and particularly in the ecosystem of blogs, he says."
"Within seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system. The shape appears largely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage. The most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate about power laws and software is that we're having the conversation."
"""I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather they never had a chance to see,"" she says. ""The public figures we have respected in our history can live on, so long as we pledge to tell and to retell their stories"""
"Lincoln was haunted by the loss of his mother, sister and first love. He became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away. He believed that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life, you could live on in the memory of others."
"Lincoln's political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide. He eventually won a seat in Congress, then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice. He surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced, far more educated rivals."
Abraham Lincoln was the undisputed captain of this unruly team. He possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view. He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility. These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.
"Lincoln's reputation was so great that he waited until he could sign with a bold and clear hand. He said, ""If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act"" Lincoln taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between work, love and play."
The White House Fellows program is one of the few opportunities for women to work in the White House. The program was created by President Lyndon Johnson after he was elected to office in 1964. The White House Fellowship program is meant to be a year-long program to help women in government.
"LZ Granderson: ""I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales"" LZ: ""He opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power"" ""It was a privilege to have known him and to learn from him"""
"Lincoln had a family who loved him deeply, and servants to answer any whim. Yet he could find no solace in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies. It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it."
"Lincoln's favorite stories include one about the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen. Allen went to Britain after the war, and the British put a huge picture of George Washington in the only outhouse. Allen came out of the outhouse not upset at all, Lincoln says."
"When Lincoln was six years old, his father taught him the art of keeping score while listening to baseball games. Lincoln: ""It makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention"" ""I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father,"" Lincoln says."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the extinction of the Greenland Norse society. Sutter: The big problems facing the world today are not at all things beyond our control. He says all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making. Since we made the problems, we can also solve them, he says."
"In the case of the Vikings, the climate got colder in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. A cold climate isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse, with cold climates. The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society."
Some societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power. These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption. One blueprint for trouble is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the society as a whole.
"The world's future is in its own hands, says the head of the World Health Organisation. The world's present course is a non-sustainable course, he says. The outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades, he adds. ""What is there that we can learn from the past?"""

"Research shows increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are. In fact, the lack of basic resources, material resources, contributes to unhappiness, but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness. ""Ecstasy"" in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something."
An artist creates sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination. He says he can't feel even that he's hungry or tired. The nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second. He doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor his body or his problems at home.
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the ""flow experience"" He says it's a feeling of effortless, spontaneous flow. Sutter: ""It happens in different realms. It's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow"""
"When people are in flow, they have a sense of what they are doing. When they are not, they feel like they need to do something else. This is called the state of being in flow. It is a state of mind that allows you to do what you want to do."
"The author tries to balance his life between physics, love and work. He lives on the Hawaiian island of Maui with his wife and two children. He says he has learned to live with the uncertainty of his life. ""I've tried to live in the moment, not in the past,"" he says."

"The shape of an electron is one of the symmetries of this E8 shape. The direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see. This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat. The way the shape twists is what the elementary particles are, themselves."
" Schrödinger is dead in one branch of reality, but alive in the other. These realities are experienced separately by each individual. The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales. It can be summed up in a single sentence: Everything that can happen, does."
The Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva has a circumference of 17 miles. A beam of protons and antiprotons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision. This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles.
"The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons. The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge, called color charge. There's the force of gravity, which interacts with matter via its mass and spin. A particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists, is the Higgs particle."
"Electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges: hypercharge and weak charge. Electrons have an electric charge, a negative one, and quarks have electric charges in thirds. The Higgs particle breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern and makes the weak force very weak."
"The electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two-dimensional space. If a particle and an antiparticle collide, it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero. The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space, and projected down to two dimensions."
The way the universe works at these tiny scales is very beautiful. We want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe. And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies.
"Physicists look for larger, more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset. The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen. The geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales."
"The pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful. It summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles, each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape. There are 20 gaps where new particles should be, two of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles."
"The Large Hadron Collider may reveal new patterns in the universe. But predicting how nature works is a very risky game, says Auger-Loizeau. New physics theories are a lot like start-up companies, he says. ""If something isn't working, you have to toss it out and try something else"""
The exhibition aims to highlight the relationship between design and science. Designers are seeking to make life easier for themselves and others. The exhibition is open to the public until September 14. The Museum of Modern Art is in London until September 13.
"MOMA is an exhibition of the work of designers and scientists from around the world. This year's show includes work from the Royal College of Arts in London. The exhibition is open to the public and runs until September 14. For more information, visit the MOMA website and Twitter account."
"In Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA. But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty. So, the assignment to the students was, how should the steak of tomorrow be? When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape, what should it be like?"
"""Design and the Elastic Mind"" will focus on science and technology. Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics in their presentations. The whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child, is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking."
"The idea of a private conversation with a stranger is becoming more common. The idea of being alone with your thoughts is also becoming more popular. The more computers we have, the more we are able to work together in a collective way. We are all part of the same community, even if we don't know it."
"In the future, designers will be able to 3D-print their products from home. The implications of this are enormous, not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process, but also no tracking, no warehousing, no wasted materials. This is what this exhibition looks at."
"Some designers don't design objects, products, things that we're going to actually use, but rather, they design scenarios that are object-based. A student at the RCA designed a blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies pregnancy."
"Elio Caccavale has been working on a series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today. The dolls include those that explain leukemia, xenotransplantation and the spider gene into the goat. The exhibition will run until September 28."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his encounters with extraterrestrials. Sutter: ""It is difficult to imagine they were not the result of frequent contact with aliens"" Sutter says he believes in the existence of aliens, but that they have not yet been discovered."
"When he was 9 years old, a man on a date asked him, ""What are you looking for, flying saucers?"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" was released that summer. ""I was horribly sunburned, just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie,"" he says."
"The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun, and then he made laser sounds. I looked into their strangely angry faces, and I remember wondering, are they wearing rubber masks? And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them."
"""I know what I saw. Maybe it was swamp gas,"" he says. ""The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand, and found it, and left me alone"" ""She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket. She had some sort of injury to her ankle, an Ace bandage,"" he adds."
"""Dune"" is about a group of men who travel through a desert planet. The movie is based on David Lynch's novel of the same name. The film was released on May 25. The book is available in paperback and on Blu-ray."
"In the mid-to-late '80s, the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called ""Communion"" in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens. The book was so successful that they made it into a movie."
"Fermi: I had a girlfriend in the Algarve, Portugal, in 1991. Fermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly, is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason there should be other intelligent life out there."
"Catherine's freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders, clustering into a kind of a tan. She was a single woman about to go alone into a country, not even speaking the language. The universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization, we should have some evidence of their existence by now."
"""I could not call her on a phone because this was 1991, and the aliens had not given us that technology yet"" ""I watched those constellations shift, hoping that they would part and I would see her face"" ""It was at that moment, in that very small town, that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe"""
"Enrico Fermi and his wife were holding hands in the street when she came back. The Liberians clapped them on the back, and left them alone in the streets. FermI: ""An event like this leaves a scar on the memory, much like a piece of alien technology"""
"In the 20th century, glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood. Glamour is a form of falsification, but falsification to achieve a particular purpose. Hedy Lamarr said, ""Anyone can look glamorous, all you have to do is sit there and look stupid"""
"Glamour is a process of ""idealization, glorification and dramatization"" Glamour doesn't have to be people. It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich. It puts you into this special, special world."
"Glamour invites us to live in a different world. Glamour does not have to be about people, but it has to have this transcendent quality. God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent, omniscient -- too far above us."
"Glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized, perfect place. The less experience we have with them, the more glamorous they are. You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside. The same thing -- arches are very glamorous."
"In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura. The art that conceals art makes things look effortless. Glamour is about editing, says CNN's John Sutter. ""We don't tell you all the grubby details,"" he says."
"Glamour is translucent -- not transparent, not opaque. Glamour invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture. Translucence is glamorous -- that's why all these people wear pearls. It's why barware is glamorous."
"Glamour is partly about meaning, says the photographer. ""All individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized in reality,"" he says. ""The way we deal with that is we displace them -- we put them into a golden world, an imagined world"""
"""We want this golden world,"" says CNN's John Sutter. ""The Matrix"" is a movie that is all about glamour, Sutter says. Sutter: ""I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad"""
Glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive. National Socialism is all about glamour. There's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life. There is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and to broaden your appreciation of it.
"David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash. There is a book out in the bookstore -- it's called ""Symphony In Steel,"" and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center. There's the glamour of physics."
"When people think about the diet I recommend, they think it's really strict. But if you're just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices. To the degree that you can move in a healthy direction, you're going to live longer, feel better, lose weight."
"Insurance will cover the bypass and angioplasty but won't, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle. 99 percent of the patients stopped or reversed the progression of their heart disease. The oldest patients improved as much as the young ones."
"LZ Granderson: The real problem isn't just heart disease or obesity, it's loneliness and depression. LZ: What doesn't work is fear of dying, and that's what's normally used. He says people use alcohol to numb the pain or work too hard or watch too much TV. Lz: The point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem."
"LZ Granderson: People are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they're worth it. LZ: When you change those behaviors, your brain gets more blood, you think more clearly, have more energy, your heart gets moreBlood flow can be affected by high-fat or low-fat meals."
Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese. Diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years. One way to lose weight is to eat less food. Another is to change the type of food you eat.
"The goal is not to go to pork rinds, bacon and sausages, but to go from ""bad carbs"" to ""good carbs"" These are things like whole foods or unrefined carbs. Fruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber."
"Fish oil can reduce the risk of heart attack and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent. The Atkins diet is based on this half-truth: Americans eat too many simple carbs. 70 percent of the people on the Atkins diet were constipated, 65 percent had bad breath, 54 percent had headaches."
"An optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs, high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats. When you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad. There are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too."
"The more people change, the more it affected the growth of their tumors. Loneliness and depression are treatable. Anything that promotes intimacy is healing. Friendship, altruism, compassion, service -- these are the perennial truths. These are the things that are in our own self-interest."
"""Yoga"" comes from the Sanskrit word for ""union,"" ""to bring together"" The word ""wellness"" is used to refer to a sense of community and love. ""We can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process,"" says the author."

Keith Schiller and his team at TED chose six ideas that they thought would be most surprising for TED. They chose to work with Roman Coppola to create a commercial for a product from the future. Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide.
"The slide would use an electromagnet to repel the rider as he goes down. The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force, would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market. The soft properties of the magnet would make it so that, if it were to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him."
A 10-foot pole can be used as an extension of a person's body. The pole can also be used to send signals back to the ground. The poles can be made to roll up or down to make them more stable. They can be attached to a person or an object to hold them in place.
"phthalmologist Keith Schacht demonstrates a water gun fight from the future. Woman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving, you could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up, and you could swim easier ... Yeah."
The fluid evaporates 25 times faster than water. It works because it's non-conductive. Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer. It's most widely used in office buildings as a fire-suppression fluid.
"The New Milk Carton is a series of videos on the power of shape-retaining technology. The technology can be applied to paper to change the way the page bends. It can also be used to make a watch that wraps around your wrist, or a picnic sheet."
"The technology was developed by Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois. Dyes change color in response to odors. The smell of vanilla, for example, might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow."
"The device can detect the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses, or even lung cancer. Currently, they're using a method of trial and error, but this could tell you precisely what disease you have. If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material, if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise."
"The future of this planet depends on humans, not technology, he says. ""We’re kind of at the endgame with knowledge,"" he adds. ""If that’s what you think I mean when I say, ""This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth,"" you're wrong by a factor of ten"""
"""Aliens of the Deep"" features two of these deep rovers. ""This, I think, represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built,"" he says. ""We’re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception,"" he adds."
"The planet has two atmospheres -- a lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one. Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere. Fish do not sit in seats. Their mothers don’t say to little baby fish, ""Careful you don't fall over"""
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater. The craft that I’m in -- this hasn’t been shown before. This was the first prototype. It has wings. There’re no silly buoyancy tanks. This is the first flying machine.
"The dive was ""the only real dive I’ve ever made in this machine,"" he says. ""We just learned so much in three hours in the water there. I just had to go and build another machine"" ""I don’t really look that ugly, but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted,"" he adds."
The world's first flight school has opened in the Netherlands. The school was set up to help people learn how to fly a sub-marine. The program is now being expanded to include a range of other types of sub-marines. It is hoped that the school will become a training ground for other submersibles.
"""It just seems wrong to try and patent -- the freedom for underwater flight,"" he says. ""The circular mill is the downside. And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for"" ""We shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started,"" he adds."
"Villagers were still terrified after the tsunami in Sri Lanka. No one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming. The sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around. When the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs. Sutter: In some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment in the blogosphere. The blogosphere came, to a certain degree, of age, Sutter says."
"CNN's John Sutter asks three questions about the blogosphere. Sutter: What does it tell us about our ideas, about what motivates people to do things? The second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibility of accessing a kind of collective intelligence? And then the third part is, What are the potential problems, or the dark side of blogs as we know them?"
"Bob Greene: We need to expand our idea of what counts as rational. He says that under the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent. Greene: It's one of the most powerful ideas in the world, and it's worth thinking about."
"Blogosphere offers possibility of getting at collective, distributive intelligence of the Web. Blogosphere gives people who have never been able to talk before a voice a voice. But the more tightly linked we've become to each other, the harder it is for each of us to remain independent."
"A network is not just the product of its component parts. It is something more than that. Once you are linked in the network, the network starts to shape your views. The paradox of the wisdom of crowds, or the paradox of collective intelligence, that what it requires is a form of independent thinking."
"""I didn’t know who I would be if I changed. But I know I needed to change, because it would be the only way that I could be here today"" ""We're just going to keep marching around and around until we die. That's the thing we have to watch out for"""
"CNN's John Defterios: ""I want to encourage you to go to that next place, to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in"" ""How we treat each other is really how we’re going to treat the environment,"" he says. ""We have to do something now. We have to change now"""
"""I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow. That’s a big thing in California. And so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued"" ""I’ve given up riding and driving in cars,"" he says. ""I'm really happy."""
"""I thought I knew everything. I didn't. And so I decided I’d better do this for another day, and another day,"" he says. ""I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more,"" he adds. ""And so I did."""
"I walked up to Ashland, Oregon, where they were offering an environmental studies degree. I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I'd like to go to school there. I showed up in two years and they -- I tell this story because they really helped me."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his time in South America. Sutter: ""I had 13 students when I first walked into the class. I could see they were looking for the schedule, to see when they could get out"" Sutter says he learned a lot from the students, including how to get around."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his time in Wisconsin. Sutter: ""I was silent for 17 years. ... I just kind of kept the fists from flying"" Sutter says he's learned to be more honest with himself and others."
"John Anderson walked across the U.S. on a banjo for seven years. Anderson: ""It’s one of those things that came out of the silence, the listening to each other"" ""I’m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak,"" he says."
"""You’re going to make a difference, buddy. How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a change?"" ""I started talking because I had studied environment. I’d studied environment at this formal level, but there was this informal level. And the informal level -- I learned about people, and what we do and how we are treated,"" he says."
"Dr. Francis: ""I was a prisoner and I needed to escape"" ""I don't know what possessed me, because this was not like me,"" he says. ""I'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world"""
"David Kelley: I was afraid to change, because I was so used to the guy who only just walked. Kelley calls this behavior, when it’s carried out by designers, ""thinking with your hands"" Kelley: Designers typically make multiple, low-resolution prototypes very quickly, often by bringing lots of found elements together."
"At IDEO there’s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment. The prototyping carts, filled with colored paper and Play-Doh and glue sticks, have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them. So when designers are working on ideas, they can start building stuff whenever they want. They don’t necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop."
"Designers need to be able to imagine how an experience might feel over a period of time. The best way to achieve that, and get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out. Instead of building play, this can be approached with role-play."
"Research into kids' behavior suggests that it’s worth taking role-playing seriously. When children play a role, they follow social scripts quite closely that they’ve learnt from us as adults. Another way for us, as designers, to explore role-play is to put ourselves through an experience."
"Designers use role-play as an empathy tool, as well as a tool for prototyping experiences. The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy. Play has rules, especially when it’s group play. Playful exploration and playful building are some of the ways that designers use play in their work."
"Designers need to be able to transition in and out of play, says Andrew Keen. Keen: ""There aren’t just rules about how to play; there are rules about when to play"" ""We go through a sort of generative mode, where we’re exploring many ideas, and then we come back"""
"Bob McKim: ""You can be a serious professional adult and, at times, be playful"" ""It's not an either/or; it’s an ""and"" You can be serious and play,"" he says. ""We need trust to play, and we need Trust to be creative"""
"Pixar and Google's offices are decorated with pink flamingos. The company's founder, David Kelley, says it's a way to make people feel relaxed. Kelley: ""It gives us a sense of trust that we need to take the kind of risks"""
"David Perry: ""I'm going to run a little experiment. I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage"" Perry: The way they work is, you know, you just put your finger in the thing, pull them back, and off you go."
"phthalmologist: ""We have them because we think maybe playfulness is important"" ""I think I'm going to take these off now, because I can't see a damn thing when I’ve -- all right, OK. So, ah, that was fun"""
"Playfulness helps us do our jobs better, and helps us feel better when we do them. Kids are more engaged with open possibilities. Most of us don’t need to anymore, I suppose. This is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen."
"Bob McKim: Kids play with boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them. ""You can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy,"" he says. ""This openness is the beginning of exploratory play,"" McKim says."
"I want you to do as many of them as you can, in the minute that I’m just about to give you. I wasn’t actually very interested in whether they were all different. I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible. So, who got more than five circles figured out?"
"Bob McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity. McKim picked 27 professionals -- they were engineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects, furniture designers even, artists -- and he asked them to come along one evening. He gave each of them some mescaline, and had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while."
"At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls. But it’s hard to break our habits, our adult habits. It turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process."
"The Eameses experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind. The average Western first-grader spends as much as 50 percent of their play time taking part in what’s called ""construction play"" ""Construction play"" is a powerful way to learn."
"CNN's John Sutter tests the smell of a fragrance called Beyond Paradise. The fragrance smells of cut grass, not potatoes or violets. Sutter says there are two theories as to why the smell is so different. The smell is caused by the atoms in the fragrance, he says."
"In the early '90s, I thought my predecessor, Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses. However, I came to realize gradually that they may be right -- and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so."
"Vibrational theory is a theory that enables you to do less work, he says. ""I love the idea of doing less work,"" he adds. ""So let me explain to you why this shape theory really does not work very well"" ""We never get the O-H -- we never mistake it for an S-H, OK?"""

"Boranes smell of sulfur had been known since 1910, and utterly forgotten until 1997. Bob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company discovered a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale. Electrons are fuzzy creatures, and they can jump across gaps, but only at equal energy."
"The method is based on the idea that the nose, the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses. The fragrance that you will smell, you will never be able to smell this way again, he says. ""You can try a thousand molecules, you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend,"" he adds."
"Coumarin is the classic synthetic aroma chemical. The molecule has made men’s fragrances smell the way they do since 1881. ""I bet you cannot make a coumarin,"" a chemist says. ""Let us try it,"" he says."
"Scientists are resistant to new ideas, he says. But when you put a little 10-gram vial on the table in front of perfumers and it smells like coumarin, and it isn’t, this focuses everybody’s mind wonderfully. ""Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person"""
"Aristotle's theory of the universe is that there are three parts: the earth, the sun and the moon. He also says that the universe was created in God's image, not by man himself. This is why we have the idea of the heavens and earth, he says."
"In a Newtonian universe, there’s no center -- thank you. There are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time. So that is both Aristotelian cosmology, and in a certain sense, medieval society. We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well."
"The universe is described by being a network of relationships. Space is just one aspect, so there’s no meaning to say absolutely where something is. This is also, if you talk to legal scholars, the foundations of new ideas in legal thought."
"Darwin says there's nothing outside the universe, so there's no place to put an explanation for something outside. In such a relational universe, if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured, like this device here, or that device there, you want to know how is it made."
"In the 20th century, we saw the independent development of two big themes in science. In the biological sciences, they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self-organized way. The 21st-century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas."

"CNN's John Defterios says the U.S. needs to be more aware of its role in the world. He says we need to be aware of the role we play in creating the world we want to live in. We need to take responsibility for our actions, he says, and not rely on others to do it for us."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide. He says the politicization of Never Again had never occurred in the 20th century. Sutter: There is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century, in an anti-genocide movement."
"CNN's John Sutter talks with members of the U.S. genocide prevention movement. The group has launched a divestment campaign against companies doing business in Sudan. Sutter: The movement has extracted from the Bush administration a series of commitments to Darfur. The bad news, however, is that evil lives on."

"In the old days, when they used to make butter -- You know how you make butter? IM: Churn from cream. SM: So you take heavy, high-fat milk, which is cream, and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.

CE: Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here."
The Mars rover is in the process of being designed. The design process is similar to what you do when you design your product. The team of engineers and scientists work in a team effort to design a spacecraft. The rover will be sent to Mars in 2016.
JPL's Mars rover will be three times the size of a car. The rover will have a heat shield to protect it from the heat of the sun. It will be launched June a year from now. JPL is testing the rover in its lab at JPL in California.
"The lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover above that surface for 100 feet. The rover will be more kind of like a chemist. The idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale."
"This is not animation or anything like this. This is actually taken from the satellite that we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini. And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings, which are the particles. Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles."
"Titan is a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere as dense as our own. Scientists are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet, which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know, below the surface."
"NASA's Cassini spacecraft dropped a probe into the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan. The planet is made of hydrocarbon and ethane and methane, similar to what you put in your car. Cassini also found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in the planet's atmosphere."
"The Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call ""forward scattering,"" so it highlights all the rings. Some people tell me to do it; I think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days. But I said I'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees."
"""I'm building the next Mars Rover. Some of the most brilliant engineers I know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them"" ""You've got to do what you want to do. And anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them"""
"Mars is a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It has polar caps and an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours. It's very similar to some extent, and you can see some of the features on it, like the Grand Canyon on Mars, or what we call the Grand canyon on Mars."
"This is one of the largest craters on Mars, Victoria Crater, which is about a few football fields in size. This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite. If I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface."
"Geologists love craters because they show the history of what happened in the past in that location. The two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old. One of the wheels is stuck, so what we are doing, we are driving it backwards."
"JPL's Phoenix spacecraft will land on Mars on May 25. The mission will take 17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds to reach the red planet. Video: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it. JPL: We try to avoid blowing ourselves up."
Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission. It's the first mission that's going to try to land near the North Pole of Mars. The plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them.
"The heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit. The spacecraft will decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour down to 900 mph. The parachute itself could fail if fired too early, Kornfeld says. The next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really is from the ground."
"BC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet. That's like taking two Empire State Buildings and stacking them on top of one another. It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen in a very short time."

"Keith Haring looked at statistically. One can see here quite clearly, you can see we have 25 pale green elements, of which one is in the form of a circle. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring's various works, to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares."
"Jasper Johns: ""I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this. It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels"" ""I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read, ""Please tidy room"" ""My room hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day"""
"Vincent van Gogh's work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements. Van Gogh: ""It's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer, otherwise it would look like this. ... Some people would make apple pie out of it"""
"Pieter Bruegel, Jackson Pollock and Georges Seurat are just a few of the artists who have used the tidy up art method. ""Tidying Up Art"" is more or less a picture book. ""There is no existing tradition in it. There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet"""
"I'm working in a related field. I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way, in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you. I started to bring some order into some flags. That's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack."
"Zander's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day. The pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate. If you go up on top of those cliffs, that's some of the Long Now land."
Danny Hillis tries to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain. The real peak is hidden around the corner. Hillis: We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on.
There are 10 ranches strung along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains. Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley. There's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it.
"This is architecture not made by building, but by what you very carefully take away from it. This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old, and look what happened to it. The most durable and intactable buildings, like the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how to build a mountain in the U.S. Sutter: ""You don't want just any mountain. You want a mountain that's going to last for a very long time"" He looks at the Great Basin in New Mexico, which is over 13,000 feet high."
"Long Now has been trying to hack civilization for 10 years. The project is located in a remote area 200 miles from any major city. The only thing that goes by is what's called America's loneliest highway, U.S. 50. Danny Hillis has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work."
"Brian Eno's new book is called ""Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now"" It's based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed, so that a peal of 10 bells makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years. Eno: It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now."
How do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we're talking about? This is not a normal building project. What do you look for? What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions? Start with borders. The borders are important. And especially trees.
"Long Now Foundation in San Francisco bought the White Mountains for 140,000 dollars. The property is an incubator for about a dozen projects, all having to do with continuity over the long term. The stone itself is absolutely beautiful, sculpted by millennia of very tough winters."
"The Pole Adit is a mile-and-a-half in a straight line, due east into the range. It was the highest-operating mine in Nevada, and it ran year round. The property was originally built around a set of mining claims. There are four species of bats in there."
"The National Weather Service has a wireless weather station on Mount Washington. The station sends a signal to a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco. The data is put in real time up on the weather station's website."
"Lincoln Canyon is one of the most beautiful places in the U.S. to hike. It's surrounded by cliffs, but there are no people to stop you. The only way to get to the top of the canyon is to go up the steep, rocky side."
"It's the first working prototype of the clock. Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London, and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there. The discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them."
"The film industry in Nigeria is 15 years old. There are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria that play, you know, VHS and these VCDs. There is no life without stories, says the director of the film, who was born in Zambia. The film will be released in cinemas across the country on September 14."
"""I wanted to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions. And so we were always caught in this stereotype. And we really had all the support to make this story,"" says director. ""It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour,"" he adds."
"Nigeria is the third-largest film industry in the world. The country is home to some of the world's most successful film companies. It is also home to one of the biggest film festivals, the Lagos International Film Festival. The festival runs from September 26 to October 1."
"In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria. 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood, says PP. ""I keep trying to explain to people, it's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming"""
"Saint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies. But then when I discovered the situation in my country, at that time there was so much corruption. For a young man to really make it out here, you got to think of some negative things and all that, or some kind of vices."
"Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars. KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know. Woman: That's why I use enough masking tape."
"Nigerian filmmakers are making movies like they need oxygen, says director. ""When I see a Nollywood film, I can relax, I really -- I can breathe better,"" says one woman. ""I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways,"" says Nollywood director."
"Nigeria's film industry is one of the most successful in the world. Nigerian filmmakers have proved that a thriving community of storytellers is the key to a healthy society. Nollywood is a phenomenon that can inspire us, says Nollywood director Adewunmi Ogunlesi."
"Nollywood is the world's third largest film industry, according to Franco. The industry produces close to 2,000 films a year. The censor board has censored 1,600 films in the last six years. Nollywood is a film industry that puts a smile on people's faces."
"There are 2,000 films in the world, and we know that there are more. The quality of film has to be raised, they need to go to the next level, but I’m optimistic. There are challenges. There is a glut of film, the quality must be raised."
"CNN's Jim Boulden looks at how the universe was created. He says there are more galaxies in the universe than there are stars. Bouldens: ""We want to see if there are any non-linear effects that are starting to move"""
"The universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine, in a certain sense. If you take a picture of the Earth two million years ago, there'd be no evidence of humans at all. The Sun is eight minutes ago. The moon is only two seconds away."
"With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years. But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further -- there's some things even further. The universe is almost a perfect sphere, but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exaggeration."
"The universe began at the beginning of the universe, and went through a period of accelerating expansion and cools. The first stars turn on, and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies. Around this period is when our solar system started forming. And it's maturing up to the present time."
"There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy, or because there are no telescopes available to do it. The next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around. Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?"
CNN's John Sutter looks at the structure of galaxies. He asks: How do you make a galaxy that looks like this? Sutter: You have to start with a very simple structure. Then you add more and more to it until you have a structure.
"It's a question of what's the continuity? So what I'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales. The stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter. And the stuff that is in the yellow color, that's the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies."
"The Hubble Ultra Deep Field contains more than 100,000 galaxies. The universe is made up of dark matter, ordinary matter, photons and neutrinos, which don't play much role in the later part of the universe. It takes light three billion years to travel over the distance between here and Andromeda."
"The universe is made up of billions of galaxies, but there's more to it than that. We'll see how the galaxies come together to form a super-cluster of light and dark matter. It's a complex system, but it's not that hard to put together."
"The universe was once a region smaller than an atom. It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations, but expanding at a tremendous rate. And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies. This is how, if you took billions of years to go around, it might look to you."
"At the beginning of the universe, gravity just pulls in. The distances on the universe are so large that it takes a long time for this to form. And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now. At that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion."
"Scientists, technologists, businessmen, engineers don't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions. The law requires accountability. The price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power of individuals."
"The danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic. We have to limit, ultimately, the ability of individuals to have access to pandemic power. We also have to have sensible defense, because no limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something."
"""We can't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat,"" he says. ""It's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things"" ""We're not going to be able to solve the problem with a million-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio,"" he adds."
"Douglas Rushkoff: ""We have incredibly powerful computers, but we don't have very good software for them"" ""We can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020,"" he says. ""I'm very certain that that will happen, the challenge is, will we develop the kind of tools"""
Gore: We can give everyone in the world a $100 computer or a $10 computer in the next 15 years. New materials bring such incredible innovations that there's a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market.
"The inside of the nanotubes is so small -- the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers -- that it's basically a quantum world. They conduct heat along their length but not across -- there is no width, but not in the other direction if you stack them up. If you shine a light on them, they produce electricity."
"Kleiner: ""We believe that Genentech, the Compaq, the Lotus, the Sun, the Netscape, the Amazon, the Google in these fields are yet to be found"" Kleiner: We raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense."
"The difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of 1,000 in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact. We need new anti-virals and cocktails, and new kinds of vaccines. We've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly."
"Pharaoh demanded that the Jews supply enough foie gras for everyone. The Jews, fearing for their life, had to come up with an ingenious idea. They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives, and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver."
It's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors. It's rooted in extraction. And for the future it won't serve us. We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture. One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation.
"The most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice, he says. ""It's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise, but almost always the most delicious choice,"" he adds. ""I went to Spain a few months ago and I had the best foie gras of my life,"" the chef says."
"Eduardo de Sousa won the Coup de Coeur, the coveted French gastronomic prize. He placed first for his foie gras. The French accused him of paying off the judges. They implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly."
"CNN's Richard Quest traveled to Extremadura, Spain, to meet the man behind the world's best-selling foie gras. The man, Eduardo, told Quest that his life's work is to give the geese what they want. Quest: ""I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature"""
"The goose whisperer is a New York Jew from New York. He's really just in love with -- he's at one with -- the geese. The geese who were on the other side of the paddock when he was around -- ""Get the hell away from this kid!"" -- when I lowered my voice."
"CNN's John Sutter talks with a man who rewired a fence to protect his geese. Sutter: ""The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside. He rewired it. He invented it"" Sutter asks: ""You fence in animals. You electrify the inside. He doesn't"""
"Over four generations, Eduardo and his family have transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu. He lets them take what they want and he says, ""Usually, it's about 50 percent. They're very fair."" The other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them."
"Lupin bush is a wild plant found in Extremadura, Spain. When geese eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow. It's the indication that it's the best foie Gras in the world."
"""I always get a little, like, weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves,"" he says. ""I'm not saying that there's not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras,"" he adds. ""But he deflected everything from his ingenuity into working with his landscape"""
"The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding. ""Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life. To happiness. They find it here. They don't need anything more,"" Eduardo says."
"""It was sweet, it was unctuous. It had all the qualities of foie gras, but its fat had a lot of integrity"" ""I was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much, he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like, this man's a genius"""
Eduardo's liver expands by eight times when he harvests the foie gras. He doesn't need salt and pepper. He's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors that his geese love to gorge on. With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.
"Chef: ""The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious"" ""I think fittingly, it's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work,"" he says of foie gras."
"The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it. The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart was walking in front of him. In times of need, we need great creativity, he says."
"Gusty, she said, for that was his name. Let's go there and make love. Ford, he called softly. For that was her name. She spread one leg, and then the other. He entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically."
"Great creativity can make politicians electable, or parties unelectable. Great creativity is something less knowable, more magical. This is a time of need. And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well. To tempt us to act differently."
"Caffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why. Fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease. High blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Unless we do something to prevent it, we’re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases."
"By 2050, there’ll be about 32 million people in the United States over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it, half of them will have Alzheimer’s disease. Right now, those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year."
"About four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact, wild and protected. Even today, individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before. ""It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me, and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is,"" says Richard Preston."
"The Lost Monarch dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast, and was discovered in 1998. The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time: not human time, but what we might call Redwood time. Redwoods are constantly in motion, moving upward into space, articulating themselves and filling Redwood space over thousands of years."
"Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers of the Redwood forest canopy. They found a lost world -- a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air, filled with unknown life. The Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth."
Children are the only primates that are afraid of heights. They use ropes to climb up trees. They can get to the top of the tree using a rope tied to a tree branch. They then use the rope to climb down the tree to the ground.
"Climbing a Coast Redwood tree is like ""scuba diving into a coral reef, except you're going upward instead of downward"" The oldest living Coast Redwoods are thought to be five to six hundred years old. The trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top."
"Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration. The oldest living Redwoods are perhaps 2,500 years old -- roughly the age of the Parthenon. If we had Redwood-like biology, we would have six layers of people on our hands, as it were."
"The Redwood is believed to be more than 1,000 years old. Scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees. The scientists are finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks, possibly all the way into their root systems."
"Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep, hundreds of feet above the ground. organisms in this soil have, as yet, no names. The largest individuals of this species, the dreadnoughts of their kind, live on the north coast of California."
"The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River. In recent historic times, about 96 percent of the Coast Redwood forest was cut down, especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging, clear-cutting."
"Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever, says Linden Lab's Philip Rosedale. ""There is no attempt to structure the experience, to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it,"" he says. ""People built the ability to have babies and care for babies"" in Second Life."

"About 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women. Women use Second Life about 30 to 40 percent more, on an hours basis, than men do. There's users from virtually every country in the world in Second Life."
"Ebay founder says he was a ""shy"" kid who didn't do as well in school as he should have. He says he's always been creative, but had a hard time building things in the real world. He's now working on a project that he says will be a game-changer for the company."
"In the pamphlet, there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones. In fact, much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm. ""That's a frightening change, frightening disruption,"" says PR."
"Philip Rosedale: Virtual worlds are ""a -- sort of a great human progress"" He says we need to ""fasten our seat belts"" because ""big changes"" are coming. He says virtual worlds are a ""space between us for creativity and design"""
"Space exploration is a ""dream that we all share,"" says Dr. Richard Quest. Quest: ""Virtual worlds represent essentially the likely, really tactically possible version of space exploration"" Quest: We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because, like space, they allow us to reinvent ourselves."
"Second Life has about 100 terabytes of user-created data, making it about 25,000 times larger. The space itself is about 10 times the size of San Francisco, and it's about as densely built out. The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true that whatever this is going to evolve into will be bigger in total usage than the Web itself."
"Virtual worlds are the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information. The Web puts information in the form of text and images. The experience of creating, consuming, exploring that information is in the virtual world. You are always there with other people. You can do tests that show that you'll remember that I was talking about a chair a few days later."
"John Hockenberry: We are social creatures and must, or are aided by, or enjoy more, the consumption of information in the presence of others. He says that wherever this is all going, whether it's Second Life or its descendants, this is what we're going to see the Internet used for, and total traffic is going to invert."
"The Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up. The idea of infinite possibility, that magic of anything can happen, only happens in an environment where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom. Those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody, even if you mean well when you build them."
"First Life originally had 16 simulators. It now has 20,000. We wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software, and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected. The fuel cell looked great: one-tenth as many moving parts, a fuel-cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine."
"CNN's John Defterios writes about how to make the world a better place. He says the first step is to get rid of the need for fossil fuels. The second is to find a way to make electricity from renewable sources, he says. The third is to make it easier for people to get around in their cars."
"Hydrogen and fuel cells can go head-to-head with the internal combustion engine. The power in four percent of the automobiles equals that of the electric grid of the US. The real exciting vision that we see is home refueling, much like recharging your laptop."
"The automobile becomes, then, an appliance, mobile power, mobile platform for information and computing and communication, as well as a form of transportation. 750 million people in the world today own a car. The key to all of this is to make it affordable and exciting, to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money."
"Cars are dramatically cleaner, dramatically safer, more efficient and radically more affordable than they were 100 years ago. But the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same. The growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don't solve the problems."
"In 1962, Buckminster Fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope. This piece is currently in process -- due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo. It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show in Greenwich Village in New York City."
"It was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere to be suspended over the East River in New York City, in full view of the United Nations. 45 years later, we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective, but what we do have is improved technology. Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display. We can use LEDs."

"Bees have caught a flu that has wiped through the population of bees. The flu was caused by a new virus to us, or newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus. The question that keeps us up at night is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu, and why are they more susceptible to other diseases?"
CNN's John Sutter talks with beekeepers about their ability to recover from colony losses. Sutter: Beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet. He says they can replace dead-out colonies with mail-delivery queens or a package of bees.
"CNN's John Sutter traveled to Haiti earlier this year. He met a beekeeper who made beeswax from cow dung, tin cans and his veil. Sutter: Beekeepers are ""some of the most independent, tenacious, intuitive, inventive people you will ever meet"""
"This is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent of the colonies. And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America. And they're not people who like to ask for help, although they are the most helpful people ever."
"Bees are paid by pollen and nectar, to move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower. They build up a static charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom. There are more bees in Pennsylvania than there are mammals and birds combined."
"Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bumblebees, sweat bees and kleptoparasites are all in trouble. He says bees are not the only important factor in pollination. Other animals that pollinate, like bats, and bats are in trouble too, he says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about Nature Deficit Disorder. Sutter: ""There is an easy cure for NDD. And that is, make meadows and not lawns"" ""I think we have lost our connection, and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment,"" Sutter says."

"In 1450s, the Catholic Church hand-wrote these things called indulgences, which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper. They traveled all around Europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands. They got you out of purgatory faster. And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print them, which was the equivalent of printing money."
"The Library of Human Imagination is three stories tall. In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination that are computer controlled. All throughout the library are different objects, different spaces and different exhibits. It’s designed like an Escher print."
"TED is all about patterns in the clouds. It’s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before. For example, we can look at a DNA molecule model here. None of us really have ever seen one, but we know it exists because we’ve been taught to understand this molecule."
"Every time you download a file, each megabyte is a lump of coal. The connection is the energy it takes to run the web, and to make everything we think possible, possible. This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the history of the printing press. He says it's been around for centuries, but it's only now that it's being rediscovered. Sutter: ""It's been a long time since I've seen a printing press that was as good as this"""
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing. White truffles are one of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world. The photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them.
"The charm of white truffles is in their aroma. The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there. The hotel suite is 4,300 square feet. It has 360-degree views. It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei."
"GQ paid 30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel in Tuscany, Italy. The buyer was Kip Forbes, son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century. Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuskany."

"Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall, and happened upon this hidden cache of wines. 1947 was a legendary vintage, especially in the right bank of Bordeaux. The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century."
"CNN's John Sutter tasted 60 wines over three days at a wine tasting. Sutter: ""Any one of the wines served at this tasting, if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know, the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable"""
Psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered that by and large people use two simple rules. People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time. The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time.
"People are enormously impatient. They require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars. What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict. People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12, they might as well wait 13. It's remarkable how easy it is to make this impatience go away."
"At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman, but at a far distance their normal, their true, relations are preserved. People always think more is better than less: 60 is always better than 50. When people get to the future, they will change their minds."
"We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands. We have no significant predators, we're the masters of our physical environment. The things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us. The only thing that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions."
"CNN's John Defterios asks why the U.S. is spending so much money on terror. He says terror is a result of people overestimating the threat. Defterio: ""It's not a tree falling on us by accident. It's a human being trying to kill us"""
"DG: ""There's a large role here played by the media, who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can"" ""We never let them win by stopping weddings,"" an Israeli mother said. ""People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty. It's not making headlines"""
"Chris Cuomo: If you had to solve one of these problems, which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty? Chris Cuomo: Americans spend more -- I should say, lose more -- gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined. Chris: Is that because in the past, in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty?"
"Jay Walker: The value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning. Walker: It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid. It's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you've lost."
Aubrey de Grey is an expert on aging. He says there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning. De Grey says it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted about the future. He also says that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease.
"In a word puzzle, recall words by their first letter, not by their second or third. The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent. The quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability."
"Drowning and asthma deaths don't get much coverage, so we vastly underestimate them. The lottery is an excellent example of people's ability to compute probabilities. The odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet."
"Bernoulli: ""If you watch nine-and-a-half years of television ... the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small"" ""The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play, even though it does nothing whatsoever"""
"The value of a Big Mac is based on what you can do with it, not how much you can get for it. When you get a job that pays more, you're more likely to want to keep it. But when you get another job, you can't afford to keep the first one."
"A $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 1,600 dollars. Most people say they would not buy it if it was on sale at 700 dollars. This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal, he says."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how people compare things. Sutter: Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people's attempts to assign value. He says that even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past, we still make certain kinds of mistakes."
"Most people don't want the most expensive item, they want the one in the middle. When you compare a $33 bottle of wine to a box of Godiva chocolates, it's not the same thing. This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions."
"If you drive across town to get a stereo for half the price, would you do it? Most people say they would, but they don't think that way. This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should. It doesn't know what you saved it on."
"The future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on Mars, he says. And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation, but I think in the future we'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about the search for life on Mars. He says finding life on another planet is a ""non-trivial occupation"" Defterio: ""The presence of life is better than no life. And so, life is more valuable"""
"Life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time. In the last 15 years, we've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed. A planet in the size-class of Earth has actually been found."
"""I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past, is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half"" ""I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet. Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them"""
Scientists are trying to find life on other planets. They are looking for signs of life on the sub-surface of Earth. Scientists are also trying to learn more about the geological history of the Earth. They hope to use this information to help them find life.
"Cave in Tabasco, Mexico, is saturated with sulfuric acid. 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you. Extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special. The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right, but they represent the average conditions that we may expect on other planets."
"There's so much energy available for biology in this cave, that there's actually a huge number of cavefish. The local Zoque Indians harvest this twice a year, as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration. This stuff is produced biologically. And so, this stuff is like battery acid."
"The sub-surface of Earth contains a vast biodiversity. These organisms, because they're very separate from the surface, make a vast array of novel compounds. The potential for exploiting this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses is completely untapped, but probably exceeds most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet."
"Robot swarms could be used to explore caves on Mars. They would be propelled by artificial muscle, modeled after insect swarms. A thousand of them could fit into the payload bay used for the current MER Rovers. The idea is to protect any potential life that we find on the planet."
"""I was trying to think, how is sync connected to happiness, and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing,"" he says. ""And so, that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go"""
People on the bridge had to walk in step with the movement of the bridge. The video shows how the people's gait changed once the bridge began to move. A bridge engineer built a simulator to show exactly what happened. It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way people walked and the way the bridge moved.
"Footage shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently rocking from side to side in unison, not only with each other, but with the bridge. Engineer: I felt I was disappointed about it. We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it."
The Ministry of Silly Walks uses a simulator to test the theory of synchronicity. Participants walk in the same way as they would if they were on a real bridge. The only way to walk comfortably is by getting in step with the bridge.
"Synchrony is a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy. For a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior, wondering how it could be possible. Only today is science starting to figure out how it works."
"Swarms look like fish schools or bird flocks, he says. Swarms are more likely to stay together because they have more eyes to spot danger. But when a predator enters the scene, swarms scatter in random directions to try to protect themselves."
"Waves of panic can propagate, sending messages over great distances. Information can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism. There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this. We don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level."
"In Southeast Asia there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies. Male fireflies flashing in perfect time together, in perfect synchrony, to reinforce a message to the females. For a long time, even after it was documented, it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion."
"Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region, the sinoatrial node. The node has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep, to send a signal to the ventricles to pump. If you look, for instance, at how lasers work, that would be a case of atomic synchrony."
"The world's smallest metronome is set to the fastest setting. The two metronomes were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart. The reason is that they're not able to communicate, the inventor says. ""This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles,"" he says."
"The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the first new bridge in over 100 years. It was designed by Lord Foster, who was inspired by the Flash Gordon comic book. The bridge is now the world's flattest and thinnest suspension bridge, with cables out on the side."
"On opening day, thousands of Londoners came out to try out the bridge. Within two days, the bridge was closed to the public. ""It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down, rather like being on the boat,"" says one witness."
"By the middle of 2009, every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop -- a little green laptop. Thirty-one countries in total are involved, and in the case of Uruguay, half the children already have them. Some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much."
"""Give One, Get One"" program generates over 100,000 laptops that are then able to give free. 50 percent of children in the world don't have electricity at home or at school. 75 percent of the little girls in Afghanistan don't go to school."
"There are more Chinese restaurants in the U.S. than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined. Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste, so they're not as sweet as our version. The Chinese moved in, saw a market opportunity and took over."
"Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history, as a matter of fact. The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington, DC. The Chinese have their own version of broccoli, called Chinese broccoli, but they've now discovered American broccoli."
"In China, General Tso is known for war and not chicken. He played an important role in the Taiping Rebellion. The house where John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is now a Chinese restaurant called Wok and Roll. chop suey is the granddaddy of all the Chinese American dishes."
"""Chop suey"" means ""jaahp-seui,"" which, translated back, means ""odds and ends"" Back then it was a way to show you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan. ""The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey,"" an article says."
"Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet, served on all seven continents. Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station, which is the main scientific station in Antarctica. NASA serves thermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts."
"There are different varieties of Chinese food. There is French Chinese food, where they serve salt and pepper frog legs. The Brits have their own version of ""crispy shredded beef,"" which has a lot of crisp. There's West Indian Chinese food and Jamaican Chinese food in Brazil."
"The 2005 Powerball drawing had 110 winners, not the expected three or four. Lottery officials looked at TV shows to see how people got their lucky numbers. They found that 104 of the winners had gotten their number from a fortune cookie. The winning numbers came from different states and different computer systems."
"A lot of the foods that we or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese. McDonald's spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product. The trick was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-efficient manner."
"Chinese food is like Linux: ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system. In New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food, where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish. In Philadelphia, you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll, which is like an egg roll on the outside and cheesesteaks on the inside."
"When he first heard of DNA amplification he thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be a real scientific discovery. He says he didn't go looking for authority to tell him if it would work or not. Instead, he says, he tried to make it work himself."
"""You've got to be very honest with what you're doing if it really is going to work,"" he says. ""I have a fairly bad memory, and dishonesty would always get me in trouble, if I, like -- so I've just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive, and that sort of leads to that kind of science"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the rise and fall of the British monarchy. He says the monarchy was built on the back of the power of the people. Sutter: ""It's a very, very sad thing to see the way the people of this country are dying"""
"In 1900, Sven Arrhenius calculated that if you doubled the CO2 level in the atmosphere, the temperature ought to go up about 5.5 degrees. But in fact, it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime; the daytime temperatures didn't go up."
"Theories about global warming are completely wrong, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: Two studies found that five and a half watts per square meter had been coming in from 1998, 1999, and the place didn't get warmer. The papers should have been called, ""The End to the Global Warming Fiasco,"" he says."
"""The planet is a pretty amazing thing, you know, it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful, and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about,"" he says. ""Some science is done for other reasons, and just curiosity. And if you just listen to the guys who are hyping those issues, and making a lot of money out of it, you'll be misinformed,"" he adds."
"Boyle was a friend of Charles II. He was a Christian guy during the weekends, but during the week he was a scientist. He made a device that could suck all the air out of a bell jar. He got into trouble with the local clergy who said, you can't make a vacuum."
"Aristotle said that nature abhors one. I think it was a poor translation, probably, but people relied on authorities like that. I moved down to La Jolla and learned how to surf. And you know, Boyle says, well, shit. I make them all the time."
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks about the first meeting of the Royal Society. He says the idea was to show off the work of science, not just talk about it. The first meeting was held in London in 17th century, and it was open to the public."
"You're not supposed to talk about anything that you couldn't demonstrate. Candles can't burn in a vacuum, therefore, probably sparklers wouldn't either. You say, anytime you have a vacuum state, you will discover that one wheel will not turn another one. That kind of thing."
"In the middle of the 17th century, what became my field -- science, experimental science -- was pulling itself away from philosophy. It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes, who was a local philosopher, said about it, you know, because you weren't going to be talking final causes. It's been so cool since then."
"Kary Mullis: ""I was born thinking about things that way, and I had always been like a little scientist guy"" ""I just had a natural feeling for science and setting up experiments,"" he says. ""I thought that was the way everybody had always thought,"" Mullis says."
"Dyson: I was thinking about making my own little rockets. I was looking for a propulsion system that would like, make a rocket, like, maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles. Dyson: You sort of -- well, let's see if I can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar."
"""I did some experiments. You know, I started off with little tiny amounts of potassium nitrate and sugar, which was readily available, and I mixed it in different proportions,"" he says. ""And it -- they burned. It burned kind of slow, but it made a nice smell, compared to other rocket fuels"""

"The speaker reflects on a diverse career spanning digital media, design, and craftsmanship. Mentored by Inami Naomi, they delve into the multidimensional nature of computers, critiquing traditional design education and exploring interactivity. From plastic blocks to LED sculptures, their creations merge technology and artistry. Raised in a tofu factory, they continue to innovate, designing shoes for Reebok and experimenting with materials like iPods."

Discovery of Archaeopteryx is one of the most important discoveries of our time. It's the first time a bird has grown to the size of a large mammal. It took the dinosaurs more than a million years to grow to that size.
"The Ur-dinosaur was a three-and-a-half foot thing, beautiful skull, predator, meat-eater, a two-legged animal. At the bottom of the cliff, we find that they're rare as hens' teeth. That's where dinosaur origins is to be found."
"The Sahara Desert is the most inhospitable place in the world to search for dinosaurs. The Sahara is one of the most difficult places on Earth to find and study dinosaurs. It is also the most dangerous, as the desert can be very unforgiving and dangerous."
"CNN's John Defterios travels to Niger to see the remains of a dinosaur. The bones were dug out of the Sahara by hand and transported by boat. Defterio: ""It is an incredible view of life, and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time"""
"Scientists have been trying to piece together the history of life on Earth since the Mesozoic. The discovery of radioactive dating changed the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically, says Dr. David Perry. Perry: ""When you pick up a piece of history like that, I think it can transform kids"""
We had to find and measure the largest Orinoco crocodile in the world. We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how they scale. We also had to make sure we didn't miss any of the bigger crocodiles in the wild.
CNN's John Defterios is in the middle of a dig in the Sahara Desert. He is looking for the remains of a 40-foot-long crocodile. The find is part of a larger project to map the history of the region.
"Tibet was a precursor to India, a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years. No one's found them. We know where they are, and we're going to go and get them next year. We need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we've been compiling."
"Scientists are trying to understand the character of that Mesozoic radiation compared to the Cenozoic. The best way to test this is to actually create a model of life in three dimensions. We can control those things that we're worried about: extinction, sampling, dispersal."
"The volantor is a four-passenger aircraft that could take off vertically, like a helicopter. On the ground, it's powered electrically. It's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels, which is a great asset because it allows you, theoretically, to use this on the highways."
"The world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow will be completely integrated. Highways are no longer being built, and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways in the next 10 years. It's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward."
"The Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour, up to 25,000 feet. It makes use of the GPS -- you're familiar with GPS in your automobile. You'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport, which may be a few blocks or miles away."
"The M400 is a four-passenger, remotely piloted aircraft. The first test flight took place in 1989, when the vehicle was deemed stable in all circumstances. The M400 will be delivered to a local vertiport, where passengers can play computer games and sleep."
"Aircraft companies gave up on vertical-takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years. The Hawker Harrier jump jet is the only operational aircraft in the world today. The rotary engine invented in the late '50s generates one horsepower per pound, which is twice as good as your car engine."
"The Skycar has eight engines, four computers, two parachutes and a voting system. Redundancy is the critical issue here, says Dr. Paul Moller. The Skycar will be a significant part of our lives within the next 10 years, Goldin says."
"The Skycar will be priced in the area of 100,000 dollars. The car will be able to go 75 miles from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 15 minutes. Only seven percent of people said they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar."
"Architects are using calculus to create new ways of looking at the world. They are looking for a combination of information and generic form. The result is a new way of seeing the world, and the way it can be seen, says the architect."
"Design Within Reach is a company dealing with simple forms and good designers. The company was one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design. It's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture, says the company's founder."
"Photographer and designer Michael Kinsman takes about 5,000 photographs a year. He finds these little vignettes, these little accidental pieces of design, to be refreshing. They give him ""a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight,"" he says."
"CNN.com's John Defterios takes a look at some of the most beautiful street scenes from around the world. He uses three criteria: free, free, not design not quite within reach, but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free."
"Cuba needs to be far more resourceful, because of the blockades and things, but a really wonderful playground. I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design. The Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good. The past and the present work quite well together in Italy."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at some of the most memorable images of the year. Defterio: ""I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements"" ""I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know. I think good design adds to culture,"" he says."
Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people. A place like Chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature. There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago.
"CNN's John Defterios is an award-winning journalist and author. He is best known for his book, ""The Art of War,"" about the Second World War. Defterio: ""The art of war is to make the world a better place for all of us"""
"Of the five senses, vision is the one that I appreciate the most, he says. ""Blind faith"" doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people,"" he adds. ""I tend to like science, where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know"""
"CNN's John Defterios talks about the importance of seeing the future. He says there are three types of vision: those based on what one cannot see, the vision of that unseen and unknowable, and that which can be based on knowledge but is, as yet, unproven. Defterio: What it comes down to, really, is four basic principles: learn from everyone; follow no one; watch for patterns; and work like hell."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his new book, ""The Art of Comics"" Sutter: ""Comic books are a way of looking at the world through the eyes of the artist"" He says the book is about the relationship between the artist and the world. Sutter's book is published by Simon & Schuster."
"""Comic books are a kind of call and response,"" says the author. ""They give you something to see within the panels, but still maintain a sense of time"" ""Comics are a way of showing the world through the eyes of an artist,"" he says."
"In comics, every aspect of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element, he says. But when sound and motion are introduced, they break with that continuity of presentation, he adds. ""The idea that as you move through space you movethrough time, is being carried out without any compromise,"" he writes."
"The comic is a different shape, but other than that, it's the same basic limitation. ""What I'm searching for is a durable mutation -- that's what all of us are searching for,"" he says. ""We are looking for mutations that are durable, that have some sort of staying power"""
"CNN's John Sutter looks at some of the world's most famous comics. Sutter: ""As the technology evolves, as you get full immersive displays and whatnot, this sort of thing will only grow"" ""I think this is important because media -- all media -- provide us a window back into our world"""
"Baker: ""The challenge of the baker, the challenge of every culinary student, of every chef, is to deliver flavor"" ""Flavor is king. Flavor rules. I call it the flavor rule,"" he says. ""You can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once, but they won't eat it again if they don't like it"""
"The first stage of cooking is ""mise en place,"" which is just a French way of saying, ""get organized"" The other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment. And on day two, we put those two pieces together."
"The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars, creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is. The yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special."
"Dough is transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread. The proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up. And then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call ""packaging,"" but my students call ""eating"""
"Baker: ""I want to go back now and revisit these steps, and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation"" ""All things can be understood on four levels: the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level, the political or ethical level. And ultimately, the mystical"""
"The first transformation -- and, by the way, the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else. The wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity. It's not only been killed, but it's been denied any potential for creating future life."
"Baker: ""The baker, in this moment, has become, in a sense, sort of, the God of his dough"" "" personality and character's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker"" ""It's all about a balancing act between time, temperature and ingredients"""
"Bread is used as a symbol for transformation. Bread is the staff of life. The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is, you know, how do you make it taste good? It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used for life."
"Bread-making is very similar to beer-making. Beer is basically liquid bread, or bread is solid beer. You can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer. So now we not only have a high-fiber bread, but now fiber on top of fiber."
"We're shifting to an experience economy, where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering. The Internet is commoditizing not just goods, but services as well. We'll start a little piece here, and I'm going to take a little bit here -- I think I'd better taste it myself."
"The experience capital in the world of conferences is in the Netherlands. The Dutch like real, natural, authentic experiences. There's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience. The experience happens inside of us. It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us, he says."
"Netherlands is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland, says David Walliams. ""Authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility,"" he says. ""We're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities,"" he adds. ""It's about supply and availability"""
"In the service economy, it is about improving quality, he says. In the experience economy, ""rendering"" authenticity is about getting consumers to believe your offerings are authentic. Lionel Trilling points to Hamlet as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon. Trilling: authenticity is being true to yourself."
"On one dimension, it's a matter of being true to yourself. Two, is other-directed: being what you say you are to others. If not, you have, ""is not true to itself,"" and "" is not what it says it is,"" yielding a two-by-two matrix."
"The term ""real fake"" was coined by Ada Louise Huxtable in her book ""The Unreal America"" ""Commoditized"" is where goods are treated like a commodity, where people don't care who makes them. Disney World, on the other hand, is a fake real, or a fake reality."
"Disney World is wonderfully true to itself. The key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business. Disney bought the ABC network, affectionately known in the trade as the T&amp;A network. Then it bought Miramax, known for its NC-17 fare, and all of a sudden, families couldn't really trust what they were getting."
"The easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not. That's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company -- advertizing things that you're not. The number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are, is to provide places for people to experience who you are."
"CNN's John Berman says authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility. He says it's easier to be authentic if you don't say you're authentic. Berman: ""What will make us happy, is spending our time and our money satisfying the desire for authenticity"""
"CNN's John Defterios looks at some of the most disturbing images from the past year. He says the images show people dying and people running for their lives. The images also show people who have lost their lives, and people who are still alive."
"Graphic design is about pulling from your background, from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience. You have to utilize who you are in your work. As we get more technically driven, the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before."
"Graphic designer John Cusack was asked to give a talk about courage. Cusick: ""I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles"" ""Why not have some fun? Why not put some of yourself into the work?"""
"""I'm a big believer in the emotion of design,"" he says. ""I think this for me is a real clear, very simplified version of what I'm talking about"" ""It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into contact with,"" he adds."

"Designer says intuition is an ingredient in design, but possibly the most important. Most schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it. ""There comes a leap in consciousness -- call it intuition or what you will -- and the solution just comes to you,"" Einstein says."
"The book is called ""Probes"" It's another word for quotes. A lot of them are never -- have never been published before, and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes. ""The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature"""
CNN's John Sutter recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house he bought in LA. The shelter was apparently built in the '60s Cuban missile crisis. Sutter used the shelter as a cover for a Nine Inch Nails DVD.

"phthalmologists are turning the lens inward into something common to all of us, and that is a genome. This is not big news to viticulturists; they have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization.

"""I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural,"" says the scientist. ""We can create bad impacts, but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made"" ""We don't invent molecules, they're here. They're in the universe. It's in there, waiting to be sequenced"""

"DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits, what we inherit, what diseases we may get. The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes. Living in your genome is the history of our species, and you as an individual human being."
"DNA is a very elegant molecule. It's long and it's complicated. Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters: A, T, C, G. And with these four letters, you can create a language: a language that can describe anything."
"We have about 24,000 genes that do things. If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing, we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office. We have about a hundred, 120,000 others that don't appear to function every day, but represent this archival history."
"We are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour; you will see that happen in the next five years. You are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here."
"In the last 30 years, technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools, he says. We now can learn the history of organisms. We can find out where your relatives come from; you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years. The toolbox exists, he adds."
"Synthetic Genomics created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug, a primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium. If you took the genome -- that synthetic genome -- and you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast, you now turn that yeast into Mycplasma. It's like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software."
"Vine experts have identified areas of vulnerability to disease. They now are understanding, and the work is going on, exactly how this plant works. ""We have the capability to know, to read that entire code and understand how it ticks,"" he says."
"In the first three months of 2013, scientists discovered all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water. We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate than plants. We find microbial life in every part of the planet: in ice, in coal, in volcanic vents."
"""We're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it,"" he says. ""We have a huge problem facing us as a species. We have to beat this"" ""We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world,"" he adds."
"Every single cell in us can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises. ""You cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends,"" Peter Ward says. ""I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't,"" he says."
"CNN's John Sutter shows a slide that was passed between the two major intelligences on Earth. Sutter: We are right now in the beautiful Oreo of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth. We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now, Sutter says."
"The Earth is going to have an age and an old age, and we are in its golden summer age right now. So, after that we probably have seven billion years. But what about accidental death? Well, paleontologists have been charting death for 200 years."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at the impact of the K-T on Earth's history. He says the event changed how geologists thought about catastrophes. Defterio: ""Every world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer, and they move about"""
CNN's John Defterios has been working on the K-T extinction for 10 years. His latest project is to look at the impact of a comet on the Earth's surface. He says the evidence suggests that a comet hit the Earth about 250 million years ago.
"The age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago ... and then a catastrophe happened. And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs. It was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did. And luckily, luckily, this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here: this is a skull."
"Life causing mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-Gaian, says David Wheeler. Wheeler: Microbes are still out there. They hate we animals. They really want their world back. And they've tried, over and over, to do so over the last 500 million years."
"Paleontologists have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field. New wave of paleontologists collect biomarkers. They take sediment itself, they extract the oil from it, and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to microbial groups."
"The Earth has never had any ice on it when we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2. We are at 380 and climbing. We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most, but my friend David Battisti says he thinks a 100 years."
"""Rare Earth"" taught me an awful lot about meeting the public. The only explanation I can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love. And this gives me enormous hope."
"The word ""hope"" comes from the same root as the word ""miraculous"" The word is used to refer to something that is likely to happen in the future. The word ""hopes"" means ""to hope"" or ""to be hopeful"""
"Václav Havel said that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right. The world will not be saved by the Internet. It'll be saved  by the human spirit, he said. ""I can't tell you how reassured I was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation"""
"CNN's John Sutter is attending his third TED Talk. Sutter: ""What I've heard is an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs"" ""What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves,"" Sutter asks."
"Every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the United States -- becomes our patient. The word ""patient"" comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer. We are, should be, morally committed to being the healer of the world."
"The world would be a very different place if loudspeakers couldn't focus light, he says. The sound is being made right next to your ears, he adds. ""I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to,"" he says of new technology."
"Inventor: ""We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics"" ""You have to be kind of smart, and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid, because you cannot be stupid and do very much"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about a new technology that can cut out sound in public places. The technology, called Safeways, is being trialled in three parts of the U.S. Sutter: ""If you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side"""
"The speed of sound is not a constant. It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure. The sound that you're hearing, unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face, is made out in front of it."
"The sound is made in the air along this column. It does not follow the inverse square law, which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance. The idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is starting to catch on. It also works for transmitting and communicating data."
"Inventor: ""I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet"" ""I have a bunch of other inventions. I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears"" ""My dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves"""
"Virus sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here. Down here you can see slower evolution: less diversity. By the time we get out here to acute bee paralysis virus, this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus."
CNN's John Sutter has been making DNA chips since he was a teenager. Sutter's latest project is a set of DNA chips that can be used to detect viruses. The chips are printed on glass and placed on the surface of the glass. They can then be used as detection tools.
"Scientists use fluorescent tags to label viruses on a small chip. Each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus. Scientists are getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus. ""It is not any one stripe or something that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here"""
"There are 102 known variants of the common cold, and only 102 because people got bored collecting them: there are just new ones every year. ""You can see, even with your eye, without any fancy computer pattern-matching recognition software algorithms, that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other"""
"The idea is, let's experimentally inoculate people with virus. This is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid. Day zero: nothing happening. Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern."
"Scientists have sequenced every known virus ever discovered on a chip. The array can detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses. The chip can also detect picornaviruses, such as the common cold and polio. Scientists hope to use the array to develop new treatments for disease."
"The chip is designed to do automatic diagnosis. The idea is that we simply have virtual patterns, because we're never going to get samples of every virus. The yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very, very fast, and the blue parts are not evolving very fast."
"The patient was treated then with a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline. On day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure. They had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat and they began to mechanically ventilate her."
"The chip could be used to find new ways to fight prostate cancer, says Dr. Bruce Schneier. Schneier: "" evolution is a balance: where you have fast change, you also have ultra-conservation"" ""I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that's unpublished -- it's going to come out tomorrow"""
"There is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. Men who have a mutation in an antiviral defense enzyme, and have a tumor, often have -- 40 percent of the time -- a signature which reveals a new retrovirus. The viral genome I'm showing you right here? It's a classic gamma retrov virus, but it's totally new; no one's ever seen it before."
"phthalmologist: ""We've done it for many patients now, and we can say that they're all independent infections"" ""We have a strong association between the presence of this virus and a genetic mutation"" ""It opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid, but that's what, you know, science is really good at"""
"Solar energy can be used anywhere on Earth, according to the author. It just affects the payback period if you're comparing to grid-supplied electricity. The potential to take advantage of solar energy in Africa is unbelievable, he says. ""Sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now"""
"The company's short-term goal is to be half the price of solar cells. The company hopes to have less than a five-year payback. ""You don't have to just have a feel-good attitude about energy to want to have one of these"""
"In 2000, when the new California energy crisis was coming, I was trying to figure out if we could capitalize on that and get people backup energy, in case the crisis really came. I concluded, after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy, it just wasn't practical to store energy. So what about making energy? Maybe we could make energy."
"A new way to make solar cells is to make them smaller and more efficient. The new method would require less than a quarter of the energy needed to make a full solar cell. It would also be cheaper than the current method of making solar cells, which requires more than a third of the power."
"Scientists used genetic algorithms to create a new type of solar concentrator. Traditionally, concentrators look like parabolas. They take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot. The new non-tracking collector collects light from a plus or minus 25-degree angle. Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours."
"The solar cell collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day. We looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track. The whole system would have a much lower profile, but also we could gather sunlight for six to seven hours."
Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved the internal combustion engine. The Stirling engine has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling Engine principle. The engine was the first to go into mass production where all the other engines didn't.
"""We tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way, because it was practical"" ""If you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn't matter so much"" ""You don't want to optimize for efficiency, you want to optimized for power per dollar"""
"The efficiency is one hundredth of one percent, because you're heating all the metal of the chamber. Instead of heating and cooling the whole cylinder, what about if you put a displacer inside? You move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shifting the air down."
"We built 100 engines over the last two years. We measured each one, we readjusted the model to what we measured. It led to a very compact, inexpensive engine. Let me show you what it looks like in real life. It's just a small cylinder down here, and it's the hot part."
"Each of the 12 petals is autonomous, and each of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user setup. The engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day as the sun moves across the sky. Each petal adjusts itself to keep the highest temperature on it."
The solar panels can be used to heat water or power a pool. They can also be used as backup power if the grid goes down. The solar panels are powered by an inverter that can be plugged into a home's AC system. The project is expected to be completed by 2015.
Cameras in the classroom could be used to assess teachers. Free courses could be made available on the Internet. Energy farms could be set up in remote areas of the country. The program could reduce the childhood death rate by a factor of two.
"I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is, and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right. The skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad. It's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things."
Disease has been a severe disease for thousands of years. Deaths peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s. The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again. That's doable in well under 20 years.
"Malaria has been eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where the rich countries are. Because the disease is only in the poorer countries, it doesn't get much investment. There's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria."
"Malaria has been eradicated in a number of countries. The malaria parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves. The market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things. The death rate will soar back up again if you go in half-heartedly."
"The world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention, he says. ""Now we're on the upswing. There's new drug discovery going on. And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective"""
"In the U.S., the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education, he says. But the balance of people are getting a poor education. The economy is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education, Obama says. ""We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity,"" he adds."
"Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school. Even if you graduate from high school, you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree. We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education."
"A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class by over 10 percent in a single year. Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter. If the entire U.S., for two years, had top Quartile teachers, the entire difference between us and Asia would go away."
"In the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled. The variation is very, very small. The way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded. The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree."
"On average, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system. A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP. They take the poorest kids, and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges."
"In a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are. Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it. New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision."
"Dance is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life. If your job is to dance, do your dance. If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, then ""Olé!"""

"In the past, artists were considered to be a product of their work, not the other way around. Now, the idea that the artist is the source of all creativity is outdated, says the author. ""It just completely warps and distorts the way we think about art,"" he says."
"The process of making a book does not always behave rationally, he says. ""It makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process,"" he adds. ""Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech"""

"CNN's John Sutter has been drawing portraits of Renaissance artists. The subject of this series, Piero della Francesca, is considered to be one of the greatest artists of all time. Sutter says the portrait of the Duke of Montefeltro is a tribute to the artist's work."
"Piero: ""Theme and variations"" is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity"" ""I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism,"" he says. ""I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster"""
"The writer struggled to come up with an idea for a new piece of poetry. He Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and pasted them down on an ugly board. The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N, even though there wasn't a lot of information in it."
Piero della Francesca was asked to do a series of paintings to celebrate his birth. He decided to combine two drawings he had made for another purpose. The result is an image that transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be.
"""Old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace,"" he says. ""I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition,"" he adds. ""If you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it? That can be a big contribution"""
"""Art is whatever"" is the title of this week's episode of CNN's Art Basel. The episode is about the nature of perspective and how it affects the way we see the world. This week, CNN's John Sutter looks at a series of images that show how perspective affects art."
"The interactive portraits are aware of each other. They can also sense their motion and tilt. There are also some neat possibilities for education, like language, math and logic games. The project is the brainchild of Italian artist Piero della Siena."
"The app is an interactive cartoon application for language learners. After about 30 seconds, it reshuffles, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. All you have to say is, ""Make words,"" and they know exactly what to do."
"Siftables act as sounds like lead, bass and drums. Each of these has four different variations, you get to choose which one you want to use. You can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. You attach it to a sound and then tilt to adjust it."
"A Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie. They can be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, and they have a screen and a wireless radio. Most importantly, they're physical, so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping."
"TED Talk: ""There's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate. There are ordinary heroes. Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too"" ""As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes,"" he says."

"CNN's John Sutter talks about the war on wisdom in schools. Sutter: Rules and incentives make things better in the short run, but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run. He says rules deprive us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations."
"Too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising, he says. Jazz musicians need notes -- most of them need some notes on the page, he adds. ""We need more rules for the bankers, God knows. We need rules!"""
"Incentives can make people less likely to do the right thing, says David Frum. In Switzerland, 50 percent of citizens were willing to have a waste dump, but only 25 percent said yes, he says. Frum: ""When incentives don't work, when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies, the response is always the same"""
"Excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity. Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated, ""We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but ""Is it right?"" So what can we do? We ought to try to re-moralize work."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at some of the world's greatest moral heroes. Sutter: Be proud that you have them. Celebrate them. And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too. ""It may be a little surprising how many things there are, but it's not surprising what they are,"" he says."
"Willie Smits' re-foresting in Indonesia is a perfect example of how to do the right thing, he says. He says it took a huge amount of technical skill, but most important to make it work is that it took knowing the people in the communities."
"The universe created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, and then you got life about four billion years. ago. Then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years years ago. That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over. If that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?"
"The U.S. government is spending $1.2 trillion a year on what it calls ""entitlements"" That figure is expected to rise to $2.5 trillion by the end of the decade. President Obama says it's time to start paying back what the government owes."
"The Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday. The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much. The next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep, you've just got to say no."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at some of the trends in the U.S. economy. He says the federal government is running out of money and needs to cut spending. Defterio: ""We've got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later"""
"The U.S. economy is in trouble, and it's going to get worse, says President Obama. He says the country needs to cut back on borrowing to avoid a financial crisis. Obama: ""If we don't start changing this trend line, we are going to start to look like Iceland"""
"CNN's John Sutter looks at a new way to build computers. He says a new generation of computers can build computers from scratch. Sutter says the technology can also be used to create new types of computers. The technology could be used in a variety of ways, he says, including gene therapy."
"Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams. They started competing. The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer. They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way that they would act as your kidneys. Those three trends are the ability to engineer cells, the able to engineer tissues and robots."
"Two years ago, you saw this creature. An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico called an axolotl that can re-generate its limbs. And that was very cool stuff back then. But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate. You can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes. And, of course if you can build mice m teeth, you can grow human molars."
"A woman regrew her own trachea, and 72 hours later it was implanted. This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest where he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers. There are now nine women walking around Boston with re-grown bladders."
CNN's John Sutter looks at the third trend: robots. Sutter: We grew up expecting that by now we would have Rosie the Robot in our house. He says we also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger. But that didn't happen.
"Oscar Pistorius was born without bones in the lower part of his legs. He sued to be allowed to run, and he won the suit, but didn't qualify by time. In 10 or 15 machine generations they will, and these are machine generations, not human generations."
"Next week is the 200th anniversary of the publication of ""The Origin of Species"" The author, Charles Darwin, argues that evolution is a natural state for all living things, including humans. ""We can speak only with music. We can't speak to the future,"" he says."
"Gustavo Dudamel: ""I wish you would use all means at your disposal ... to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas"" ""For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time,"" he says."
"Jill Tarter: I hope we will find evidence that there is intelligent life on this planet. She says she first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. ""It's one of my favorite bathing suits. It's so simple to drive,"" she says."
"Most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea."
"New technology is helping us understand the nature of nature, says Andrew Keen. Keen: We've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. ""With knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves"""
"Carbon dioxide is changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup. We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea."
"We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers."
"In 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection."
"The world needs to find new ways to protect the environment. The world's oceans need to be protected. We need to protect them from climate change. We must protect the oceans from the effects of climate change, which is a threat to our health and the planet."
"A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity. New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- to figure out the next steps."
"""We want to change the way the world looks at the world,"" says the group's founder. ""We want the world to look at us in a new way,"" he says. ""I want to make the world a better place for all of us"""
SETI is the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. SETI uses the tools of astronomy to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there. It might be that some massive network of communications or some shield against asteroidal impact could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies.
The universe is more than one billion stars. There are more than 100 billion planets in the universe. The Earth is only one of many planets that could be habitable. The universe is vast. It could be much more than we think. It is possible to find life on another planet.
"Phil Morrison calls SETI, ""the archaeology of the future"" Morrison: If technologies don't last and persist, we will not succeed. Morrison: It's a story of nations, of ideologies, of territories, and of conflicts among them."
"Humans are not the pinnacle of evolution. We are one small leaf on a very extensive Tree of Life. We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life, but our ego hasn't caught up yet. So, one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity of life on this planet."
"In 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published ""The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres"" In 1960, Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation looking at two stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. In Northern California, we're beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes."
"2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope. Next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are, the targets for SETI's searches. Ed Ulbrich: This is a very good year for the SETI Institute."
This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story. It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse. There's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body. We've created a completely digital human head.
"The film is based on a true story about a young boy and his father. The boy's father is the main character in the film. The film is about the boy's journey to find his father after his father's death. The movie is called ""The Boy and His Father"" and is directed by David O. Russell."
"""We used lots of cheats and shortcuts. But we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work"" ""We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character. And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man"""
"""We had a big problem: we didn't know how we were going to do this,"" says director. ""We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program,"" he adds. ""You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that"""
"Pitt: ""We realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 and where we needed it to be"" ""We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone. We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles"""
"""Technology stew"" is code in software that allows disparate pieces of technology to work together. ""We had to create kind of a sauce. And the sauce was code inSoftware that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces to come together and work as one"" ""We were left with this idea that we ended up calling ""technology stew"""
"BP: ""This was the breakthrough. This is when we're like, ""OK, we're going to be OK, This is actually going to work"" BP: ""We ended up with a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing"""
"BP: ""We need to put another 40 years on him at this point"" ""The eyes, the jaw, the teeth: everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has"" ""We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution"""
The film was shot on location in New Orleans and locations around the world. Brad Pitt was filmed on a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen. The actors wore blue hoods so they could easily erase their heads and put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate camera motion.
"The film was shot with four HD cameras. David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast. ""We encouraged him to improvise. And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go,"" says BB."
"                 Hair started growing in all sorts of places, along with other things.                 The key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.                 I felt pretty good, considering.                 We worked from dental molds of Brad.                 It was a long process."
The tongue had to be absolutely accurate. Brad Pitt's tongue was very popular. There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance. The plastic beverage bottles used in the U.S. every five minutes are imaged by Chris Jordan.
"Caps from the Pacific Ocean are being dumped in the U.S. because they are too heavy to carry. The caps are made from a material called polyethylene terephthalate, or PET. The PET is used to make plastic bottles, which are used in the manufacture of the caps."
"CNN's John Sutter spent a day collecting plastic bottle caps from the ocean floor. He put them on display at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro. Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display. Sutter: ""I thought I would spend 20 bucks. That day I ended up spending nearly 60"""
"""We can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken,"" he says. ""We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff,"" he adds. ""It's just not possible"" to clean up all the plastic, he warns."
Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash. Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal. It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants.
"Most research using submersibles has taken place well below 500 feet, he says. Scuba divers can't get there, submarines go right on past it. It took him a year to learn to walk again after his diving accident in Palau."
"The deeper you go underwater, the higher the pressure is. The effect of that pressure is you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take. The limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body, all the nitrogen and all the oxygen."
"The ""rapture of the deep"" was the first of its kind ever taken alive. It's nitrogen narcosis. It happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body. The deeper you go, the loopier you get. To obviate the problem, remove the nitrogen and replace it with helium."
"CNN's John Sutter takes a look at a new type of closed-circuit camera. The new camera allows him to take pictures of fish at depths of up to 300 feet. Sutter says the new camera is a big step up from the old one, which was much smaller."
"There are three basic systems to a closed-circuit rebreather. The most fundamental is called the breathing loop. It's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it; it's a closed loop, and you breathe the same gas around and around. The second main component is the gas system."
"The most critical part of a rebreather are the oxygen sensors. The way you manage all these different gases and different gas supplies is this really high-tech, sophisticated gas block up on the front here. It's got the valves and knobs and things you need to inject the right gases at the right time."
"Ed Harris: ""It's like skydiving in slow motion. It's really very interesting"" Harris was paralyzed from the neck down by a bad case of the bends. Harris: The water is very clear, because there's hardly any plankton down there."
"CNN's John Defterios goes to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to find new species of fish. He finds hundreds of fish, many of them new to the area. Defterio: ""There's no situation in the world that can seem tense"""
"Sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be. A couple of these were sold through the aquarium trade to Japan, where they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece. Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing, look at the monetary value. This one -- you can see how ugly it is."
"This fish is called the Dr. Seuss fish, since it looks like something from one of the books. This fish builds these giant mounds, one pebble at a time, in Papua, New Guinea. It's extraordinary to find something like this, it's not just new species."
"There are probably about 2,000 to 2,500 new species in the Indo-Pacific alone. There are only five to six thousand known species, so a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known. We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently not."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his philosophy of life in general. Sutter: ""We all have two goals. The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet"" ""Once you're dead, you really can't enjoy anything after that,"" Sutter says."
"Twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want, be they momentous occasions or mundane ones. The President himself is our most popular Twitter user, although his tweets have dropped off as of late. Politicians have recently begun Twittering. There are 47 members of Congress who currently have Twitter accounts."
"Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium: you send one message and it goes out to everybody. One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message. We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send Twitter updates."
"People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter in a matter of days on several occasions. The trend of people using this communication network to help each other goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends. It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information, more good things happen."
"Evan Spiegel: Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept. You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less, and people who are interested in you get those updates. Spiegel: Blogger was a side project to my previous company, thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side."

"In 2002, 50 percent of the people in East Borneo were jobless. There was no agricultural productivity left. This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife. The climate has changed. There is no more flooding, no more fires."
"The forest is home to more than 1,000 species of birds, reptiles and animals, including 30 species of reptiles. The forest was destroyed by slash and burn agriculture and people burning the trees for fertilizer. The reforestation was done by combining agriculture and forestry, combining agriculture with forestry."
"""We do the ""people, profit, planet"" principles, but we do it in addition to a sure legal status,"" he says. ""If the forest belongs to the state, people say, ""It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone."" And then we apply all these other principles like transparency, professional management, measurable results, scalability, etc."""
"In 1998, an area of about 50 million hectares was lost to forest fires. The problem is that once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season -- you get cracks, oxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again."
"""We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year. It was a disaster for orang-utan,"" he says. ""You have to do it with the local people. That is the short-term solution. But the long-term answer is to build up the infrastructure"""

"The nursery is growing 10 times more tree species than the number of species in Europe. The aim is to grow crops that can be used by the local people. The nursery has 137 species of birds living in it, including more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world."
"We can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology. So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius. And we looked at the reforestation area, the semi-open area and the open area. And finally I made it into the rain machine."
"In the tropics, raindrops are not formed from ice crystals, which is the case in the temperate zones. 4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy. Common groups, like the sloth, have clear adaptations for forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws."
"The author's passion is the plants, the so-called epiphytes, that grow up on trees. These plants occur in great diversity, over 28,000 species around the world. They grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests."
"CNN's Jim Boulden looks at the role of trees in the U.S. Forest Service. He says they play a key role in the health of the nation's forests. Bouldens: ""It's not an easy thing to be a forest ranger and try to understand what's going on"""

"Professor of ecology and environmental studies, Michael Schulder, has created a series of installations in the rainforests of Costa Rica and the Pacific Northwest. He has also started a program to bring musicians to the canopy to make music and dance in the forest. The program is also linking up with environmental groups to perform the science, the dance and the environmental outreach."
"In the Pacific Northwest, there's a whole industry of moss-harvesting from old-growth forests. The mosses are used by the floriculture industry, by florists, to make arrangements and make hanging baskets. It's a 265 million dollar industry and it's increasing rapidly."

"When you're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you makes you depth-first. When you're happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirts dopamine into the prefrontal lobes, which makes you a breadth-first problem solver. You're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking."
"There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design. My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about, and ""pretty,"" and ""emotions"" The brain works differently if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative."
"The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun, says Alessi. Most of what we do is subconscious.

"Play is a process of nature that's within all of us. It's a state of play that allows animals to explore their surroundings. It is also a way for us to understand the nature of our own mortality. It can be seen in the example of the polar bear, which is in an altered state."
"Play is ""seriously, but dangerously fun,"" says evolutionary biologist. The human hand, in manipulation of objects, is the hand in search of a brain. Play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way, he says."
"JPL, NASA and Boeing hire two consultants to help them solve problems. Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson are neurologists and mechanics, respectively. Wilson found that students who couldn't solve problems with their hands hadn't worked with hands. Johnson found that if students hadn't done stuff with hands early in life, they can't problem-solve."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the history of play and its effects on the brain. Sutter: We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain, because funding has not been heavy for research on play. He says a really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play."
"The National Institute for Play is studying the neuroscience of play. The institute's scientists are using a 256-lead electroencephalogram to study the brain's response to play. Play fires up the cerebellum, puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe -- the executive portion of the brain."
"Rats have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture. The players slowly explore the environment, and begin again to test things out. The non-players never come out -- they die. The basis of human trust is established through play signals."
"Jane Goodall: Chimps are the most youthful, flexible, the most plastic of all creatures. She says they are also the most playful and adaptable. Goodall says chimps have a lot of learning to do. She shows us some of her favorite chimps and polar bears."
"Al Gore's life was programmed, says TED Talk host. The frustration was all this unlocked potential, he says. Gore is a motivational speaker who gives play as a transformative force over his entire life. He says it's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then."
"20 years ago, when I wanted to reframe the way we use information, I invented the World Wide Web. It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again. I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents on this web thing. And you did it."
"20 years after his first TED Talk, Hans Rosling is still reframing data. Rosling: ""Data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it"" The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple to use."
"In 1989, I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system. We're using them for people, places, products, events, and all kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP. When I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born. I can then look up the region it's in, and the town it is in. That's it, really. That is linked data."
"The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had. The more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is. The web allows you to put all kinds of data up there. The exciting thing is it's starting to grow."
"President Barack Obama said in a speech that U.S. government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats. ""It's actual useful. It's got value. I can use it in my company,"" says Hans Zimmer. ""We're talking about making the world run better"""
"Tim Berners-Lee: ""We have to ask for raw data now"" ""A lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases,"" he says. ""We want unadulterated data,"" he adds. ""I wrote the code and put it out there"""
"Scientists are stymied by the locked-up data on proteins, says Dr. Richard Branson. Branson: ""Data is about our lives. Every time you do things on the social networking site, the site is taking data and using it"""
"The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability between social networking sites. The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it. The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki."
"TED Talk: Linked data is about connecting data together in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents. When you connect data together, you get power. You get this really huge power out of it. And I think it's an idea worth spreading."
"Darwin: Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector, because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer, to put it very crudely, and that's why we like sugar. Honey is sweet because we like it, not ""we like it because honey is sweet"""
We and the chimps evolved our different ways. Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring. A recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of their own baby's dirty diapers. There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness.
"The Hurley Model is a neuroscientific probe into the architecture of the brain. Matthew Hurley is the first author of this book, which will be published in 2015. Hurley: ""We’re using humor as a sort of neuro scientific probe by switching humor on and off"""
"After leaving the hospital, he started studying at the university. He learned that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way. ""I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients?"" he says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his interest in irrational behavior. Sutter: ""There's a lot of mistakes we do. And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities"" ""I want to talk to you about cheating,"" Sutter says."
"In economic theory, cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis. We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents, a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per right question. Some people shredded half the sheet of paper, so there was some evidence left."
"Researchers found that when people were given the chance to cheat, they did not cheat at all. The more religious people cheated less, and the less religious people -- the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments -- cheated more. The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments, they stopped cheating."
"MIT professor: ""Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system"" ""Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"" he asks. ""No cheating whatsoever"" when atheists are asked to swear on the Bible."
"In an experiment, students were paid by tokens instead of dollars. They exchanged tokens for dollars, then walked 12 feet to the side, and exchanged it for dollars. The subjects doubled their cheating, the experimenter says. ""When we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat,"" he says."
"A group of Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students tried to rip each other's sweatshirts. When one of the students got up and said, ""I solved everything,"" cheating went up. ""If you've finished everything, go home. The task is finished,"" the experimenter told him."
"When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less. When we get bigger distance from cheating, from the object of money, people cheat more. If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating, we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way."
"CNN's Jim Boulden says he believes in the power of intuition. He says it can be used to make a difference in people's lives. But, he says, it can also be used as a tool to stop people from making bad decisions."
"CNN's John Defterios has a huge collection of photos of dodo skeletons. He decided to make his own, but couldn't afford to buy one on eBay. Defterio: ""I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell"""
"Mike Murnane is a hard-edged model maker. He created a model of a dodo skull in Mauritius. The island is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished, all within about 150 years. The model was based on a photo of a woman's hand that he found on eBay."
"The Maltese Falcon is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a Swedish Count. It is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the MalteseFalcon. ""I am absolutely a Chandler person. But in this case, it's not about the book or the movie or the story, it is about the object in and of itself"""
"The Maltese Falcon is one of the most famous props in the world. The bird was created out of words by Hammett and is the inspiration for the Kniphausen Hawk in the movie. The Falcon was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props at the time."
"Sculpture of the Maltese Falcon was done in three days. It was created with a mixture of sand and water. The image was created to look like the real thing, not a replica of it. The original image was taken from a photograph taken at the same time."
"In 1974, during the production of a weird comedy sequel to ""The Maltese Falcon,"" a plaster original of the bird was stolen out of the museum. John's Grill, which is still a viable San Francisco eatery, counted among its regular customers Elisha Cook, who played Wilmer Cook in the movie."
"CNN's John Sutter takes a look at the progress of his latest project, the Sculpey Falcon. Sutter has been working on a 3D scan of the Falcon since the beginning of the project. The Falcon is now 27 and a half pounds, half the weight of his dog Huxley."
"CNN's John Defterios looks back at some of the best-known photographs of the 1930s and 1940s. He says the images show a time when the world was moving at a rapid pace. Defterio: ""It was a time of great promise, but it was also one of the most dangerous times in history"""
"The author is a fan of faux-nostalgia, achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened. The Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go, he says. The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody, he adds."
"CNN's John Defterios is a veteran journalist and author. He has written several books on the history of journalism. Defterio: ""It's just a sick, silly joke. It's not a serious thing."" He says he has also written a book about the Battle of the Bulge, which was fought in 1859."
"""Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for,"" he says. ""I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers"" ""I've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept,"" he adds."
"This is the only fashion cover I've ever done. I had a horrible red wine hangover, in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down. This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France."
"With these three plants, you can grow all the fresh air you need, says Frank Gehry. The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi. There is a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors for 10 hours."
"40 percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings. 60 percent of world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years. The three plants are Areca palm, Mother-in-Law's Tongue and money plant."
"Kites can generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine. Wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar. The majority of it is in the higher altitudes, where we don't have a technology as yet to get there."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams. Sutter: We're working towards megawatt-scale machines that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity. ""I think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things,"" he says."
"Kites are more than a thousand years old, and the Chinese used them for military applications, and even for lifting men. In 1827, a fellow called George Pocock pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies in races against horse carriages across the English countryside."
"CNN's John Defterios meets Jane, a Kenyan woman who turned to prostitution to survive. She says she had two dreams: to be a doctor, and to marry a good man. After her husband left her, she turned to tailoring, which she now does for a living."
"Jamii Bora: ""The complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable"" ""I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses, and also the jewelry that she makes, that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day"" ""If you gave me 10 minutes my bags would be packed"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his visit to the Mathare Valley slums in Kenya. Sutter: ""I truly believe it's where dignity starts. We owe it to the Janes of the world. And just as important, we owes it to ourselves"""
"CNN's John Sutter meets a woman who has rented a tin shack for 32 years. Land-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years, Sutter says. Sutter: ""It was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes"""
"This is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com. The really beautiful thing is, you know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller. This is the -- I love this -- the boss call."
"Lenny Kravitz: The biggest change when Internet met phone was with the iPhone. He says until the iPhone came along, the carriers held veto power over every aspect of every phone. ""It's the most popular VOIP service in the world: It's Skype,"" he says."
"Apple's new iPhone is a ""flawed masterpiece,"" says Apple CEO Tim Cook. Cook: ""It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC, and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world"" The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd."
"The iPhone has opened up the idea of an app store. Programs can use all the components of the iPhone -- the touch screen. They have 10,000 of these programs. You type in what you want, and it gives you the translation."
"You type in a band or a song name. It will immediately play you that song or that band. If you like it, it tries another song on you from a different band. Over time it tailors the songs so that it stops playing bad songs. It eventually only plays songs you like."
"The new Apple Power Music Stand is only three pounds, or 12 if you install Microsoft Office. Every cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on. It's a new world of innovation, where the cell phone becomes your laptop."
"phthalmologist: ""I want to wipe the smudges clean. I want to say, ""Look -- now I'm cool"" I stood in line and I'll get mine"" ""It's really cute. It's got some flaws; we may just face it,"" he says."
"The program was introduced last year on June 29, the same day the iPhone came out. You have a choice of phones, including a Blackberry, that have Wi-Fi. The number of standard cell phones offered by US carriers with free VOIP is zero. The New York Times has very rigid policies about that."
"The deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot, all your calls are free. The thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before is, when you're on a call, the call is handed off in mid-syllable, seamlessly."
"The boundaries between the cell phone and the Internet are melting, JP says. T-Mobile phones can start a call in your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot and talk until the battery's dead. The call will continue to be free. It also works the other way."
"You can make free unlimited calls home to the U.S. with these phones. This is another favorite of mine. I have two cell phones, so this going to be very odd, if it works. This one is going off. And -- oh, I have the ringer off."
"Google is working on a way to ring all of your phones at once. The idea is that you never miss a call. Google bought it, and they've been working on it for a year. When you call 411 on your cell phone, they charge you two bucks. It's an outrage."
"You can text ""pharmacy Chicago"" or ""weather"" to Google. In five seconds, Google will send back the closest drugstore. You can also text ""phone number"" to get the phone number of the store. It's totally free -- there are no ads."
"Google's new voice-activated search engine uses speech recognition. The only downside is that it requires you to know how to text -- send a text message. Top eight results: Number one, Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street, Monterey, California. Top two: Bagels, commissary department."
"DP: He's connecting me! He doesn't even tell me the phone number. He's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet. You can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone, but its just a fake-out."
"""It's gotten me out of so many tough positions like, ""When's the last flight out of Chicago?"" You know. It's just absolutely amazing,"" he says. ""It's as though there is a human being on the other end of the line"""
"CNN's John Defterios explains how to get rid of your cell phone voicemails. He says it's a waste of time and money. Defterio: ""You can take it to London or Siberia, and your next door neighbor can dial your home number"""
"Michael Schulder: Callwave promises that it's all software -- nobody is listening to your messages. The service also promises that they're going to transcribe only the gist of your voicemail messages. Schuider: I've had too many stand around and wait to see if it's missed, then they go and it's too late."
"I coined my own definition of success in 1934, when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend, Indiana. I ran across this simple verse that said, ""At God's footstool to confess, a poor soul knelt, and bowed his head. 'I failed!' he cried. The Master said, 'Thou didst thy best, that is success'"
"""I know I'm not what I ought to be, what I should be, but I think I'm better than I would have been if I hadn't run across certain things"" ""No written word, no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be; nor all the books on all the shelves -- it's what the teachers are themselves"" ""I love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow"""
"UCLA coach says he was a stickler for his players to be clean and neat. He also made them wear jackets and shirts and ties. ""I believe in time; very important. I believe you should be on time, but I felt at practice, for example, we start on time"""
"""I believe starting on time, and I believe closing on time,"" he says. ""One word of profanity, and you are out of here for the day"" ""Never criticize a teammate. I didn't want that. I used to tell them I was paid to do that"""
"The author believes that we must have faith and patience in everything we do. He also believes that things will work out as they should, providing we do what we should. ""I worked on this for some 14 years, and I think it helped me become a better person,"" he says."
"""I wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things, and not the end itself,"" he says. ""If you make an effort to do the best you can regularly, the results will be about what they should be,"" he adds. ""Only you will know whether you can do that"""
"The journey is better than the end, Cervantes said. Sometimes when you get there, there's almost a let down. But it's the getting there that's the fun. Sometimes I'm asked who was the best player I had, or the best teams."
"When he was a coach, Bob Greene saw two young players who couldn't play varsity. Greene: ""I thought, if he ever makes the varsity, our varsity must be pretty miserable"" Greene: The next year, one of the players was a starting player on the national championship team. ""Those are the things that give you great joy"""
"Researchers have been studying people who have intensive contact with wild animals. They collect blood from them, other specimens to look at the diseases in the animals as well as the humans. The aim is to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor on a regular basis."
"This was the decade in which we discovered AIDS and the virus that causes it, HIV. There's at least three viruses that you know about, which are in this particular monkey. And there's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals. These individuals are at specific risk, particularly if there's blood contact."
"CNN's John Sutter shows a photo of the man who hunted the monkey in Congo. Sutter: ""Why did we let these behaviors continue? Why did we not find some other solution to this?"" ""Bush meat is one of the central crises, which is occurring in our population right now,"" he says."
"CNN's John Defterios travels to Cameroon to meet the people affected by the disease. He meets a man who has been infected with the disease for more than a decade. The man, who is in his 60s, is helping to raise awareness of the disease, Defterius says."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at some of the work being done in Cameroon. He says the country is the coldest place in Central Africa. Defterio: ""We made a number of discoveries. If you look in the right place, you can actually monitor the flow"""
"In the '40s and '50s, had we seen this disease, how might that have changed? That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas. So it's not just hunters in Central Africa. It's also working in live markets."
"The dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about, she says. The vast majority of viruses come from animals. Only at the very top of the pyramid do these things become completely human. The girl remembers, in this infinite instant already now so many times divided, the sadness she felt once, hardly knowing she felt it."
"The poet is fascinated by women's breasts. He says he's never seen an unsmudged nipple, an uncensored vagina, has left him forever infected with an unquenchable lust of the eye. ""I'm hardly myself if I'm not in a state of incipient desire,"" he says."
"The poet's wife died in the camps, that too people -- or Jews anyway -- kept from their children back then. ""My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds. When we make love, her holding me everywhere all around me, I'm there and not there,"" he writes."
"Spencer's poems are dedicated to his grandmother, who was shocked by his work. The first one is dedicated to Spencer, and his grandmother. The poem is called ""Dirt"" and is a longish one, about the old and the young."
"The writer's first real love was his college sweetheart, who -- till I left her -- played the same record. The last time he saw her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox. She lost three children as babies, then her husband died too, leaving young sons."
"The author recalls the last time he saw his ex-girlfriend. He recalls her drunkenly stumbling, falling, sprawling, her eyes veined red, swollen with tears. He also recalls her whispering, ""Thanks love"" Lightly, lightly against him."
"The poet recalls his childhood love of horses and their riders in his latest poem. The poem is called ""Gas"" and is about a woman who lived on the 103rd Street subway station. The woman lived all last autumn and winter, day and night, until finally one day she vanished."
"""I was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control, and I'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench"" ""She boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously, wrathfully even, when her bottle was empty"" ""All along it was the sadness, the squalor, but I never, until now loved her again"""
"""This Happened"" is a new poem by the British artist. ""I wanted to make posters, not newspapers,"" he says. ""My approach was very egotistic. I wanted my artistic statement, my interpretation of reality"" ""I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation. I'm going to talk about my personal experience"""
"In Poland, our pages were named ""Covers of the Year"" three times in a row. Other examples you can see here are from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and central European countries. The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece, as one composition -- like music."
"In Russia, plus 11 after one year, plus 29 after three years of the redesign. In Poland, plus 13, up to 35 percent raise of circulation after 3 years of redesign. The real hit was in Bulgaria, where the paper grew by up to 30 percent."
"The role of a designer is to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end. You can live in a small poor country, like me, and work for a small company, in a boring branch. You just need inspiration, vision and determination."
"20 years ago, Swedish publisher Bonnier started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc. After a few years, they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe. They were run by an inexperienced staff with no visual culture, no budgets for visuals."
"In summer 2000 he was the first to BASE jump the Eiger North Face in Switzerland. In 2008 he jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step, he says."
Ueli Gegenschatz wants to set a world record in flying from a cliff with his wingsuit. He also has a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before. He believes this is the closest he can get to the human dream of being able to fly.
"UE: Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving. We're still working on it and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance, to get more knowledge. JC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you amongThose trying to do it?"
"UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles. The one with the yellow-green suit, he's flying head-down. And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation in freefall also, with the helmet cam to film this jump."
"The main goal was to smooth out the interior, and begin to speak about motion, and mobility, and independence. The material of choice, laminate, that I was trying to highlight, only bends in two dimensions. What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell."
"Airstream's Bambi 16 is the company's first new trailer in more than a decade. The trailer was designed to appeal to skateboarders, surfers and rock climbers. The trailers themselves are actually hand-built. All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely."
"Airstream was originally conceived as a lightweight, modern, futuristic, high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and the interiors were completely out of sync with that. U.S. is currently ahead in military robotics right now, but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage."
"The future of war may be a cross between al Qaeda 2.0 and the Unabomber. For about a thousand dollars, you can build one yourself, equivalent to what the soldiers use in Iraq. Good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits, but so might bad guys."
"There's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from Iraq on YouTube right now, most of it gathered by drones. Soldiers have a name for these clips. They call it war porn. It could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the role of technology in the war on terror. Sutter: ""It's our human failings that are leading to these wars"" He says the future of war will be more like the war in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"CNN's John Sutter says drone pilots have higher rates of PTSD than many of the units physically in Iraq. Sutter: ""It's like a video game,"" is what one young pilot described to him of taking out enemy troops from afar. He says Moore's Law is operative, but so's Murphy's Law."
"CNN's John Sutter asks: How do we catch up to 21st century technologies? Sutter: Robots are emotionless, so they don't get upset if their buddy is killed. He asks: Are we going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry."
"The building was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding, people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads. It is the capital of the country, and it took 23 years to build, which is something they seem to be very proud of. The building was finished in 1983."
"Richard Saul Wurman was a real nomad, says Moshe Safdie. Louis Kahn: How accidental our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance. Nathaniel Kahn: A film also exists in time; it's an experience that you should go through emotionally."
"NK is the architect's son, he was my father. He wanted this film to be driven by emotions, and really to follow my journey. Man: We are the morning workers who come, all the time, here and enjoy the walking, city's beauty and the atmosphere."
"NK: 'He paid his life for this, and that is why he is great and we'll remember him' SW: 'In social aspect of his life he was just like a child, he was not at all matured. He could not say no to anything, that's why, that he cannotsay no to things, we got this building today'"
"phthalmologist says his father believed the greatest things in life were accidental, and perhaps not planned at all. He adds that if you engineer what they do you can change the world, you can get a better result. ""I got very nervous halfway through the talk though, just panicking whether you'd included in your model, the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result,"" he says."
"Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: It would be a good thing if people paid more attention, took seriously, and engaged in the same sorts of calculations. It would change things in two beneficial ways, he says. He says game theory assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them."
"In order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests, we have to think about who has influence in the world. If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States may have some influence. But we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder."
"In order to predict effectively, we need to use science. But let's face it, the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran. With five decision-makers there are a lot of linkages -- 120, if you remember your factorials."
"The U.S. government has doubled the number of people it needs to know to predict future events. The number has been increased from 120 to 1,200, but it's still not enough to predict the future. President Barack Obama has pledged to increase the government's role in predicting future events, including climate change."
We need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand. How willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up. How much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue? How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting.
"CNN's John Defterios makes three predictions about Iran's nuclear program. Defterio: ""I'm not projecting some past data into the future. I've taken inputs on positions and so forth, run it through a computer model"" Defterius: ""At 130, we start somewhere above 130, between building a bomb, and making enough weapons-grade fuel so that you could build a bomb"""
"The yellow line shows an analysis of 87 decision makers in Iran. The white line reproduces the international environment if Iran was left to make its own decisions. The line comes down faster if they're not put under international pressure. By the end of this year, beginning of next year, we get to a stable equilibrium outcome."
"Iran's moneyed interests are growing in political clout. With the exception of one group of mullahs, who are not well known to Americans. The Ayatollahs, mostly based in Qom, have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder."
"Bacteria are not passive riders. They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy. They digest our food, they make our vitamins, they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out. They do all these amazing things that help us."
"Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth. When they're alone, they don't make light. But when they're in a community, they do. They use a chemical language to tell each other what they are doing. It's a new way to understand how bacteria work."
Vibrio fischeri lives in the Hawaiian bobtail squid. The squid has developed a shutter that can open and close over the specialized light organ housing the bacteria. The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light.
"The Vibrio fischeri uses light from the bacteria to counter-illuminate itself in an antipredation device. The bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule. When the molecule increases to a certain amount, it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to make light."
"All bacteria have systems like this. They make chemical words, they recognize those words, and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison. So now we have a fancy name for this: we call it ""quorum sensing"""
Bacteria use a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings. The left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria. But the right-handpart of the molecules is a little bit different in everysingle species.
"Bacteria have a species-specific system, they have a molecule that says ""me"" But then running in parallel to that is a second system that's generic. This molecule is the trade language of bacteria. It's used by all different bacteria, and it's the language of interspecies communication."
"The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria. The molecules look kind of like the real molecules, but they're a little bit different. And so they lock into those receptors, and they jam recognition of the real thing."
"Bacteria have been on the earth for billions of years; humans, a couple hundred thousand. Bacteria have these collective behaviors, and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals. We think by studying bacteria, we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body."

"25 percent of the energy for the entire industrial world in the U.K. came from a source of energy that was immoral: human slaves. The answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership, he says. ""In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic ""batteries not included,"" he adds."
The network has two components in them. First component is you charge the car whenever you stop. The second element is a battery swap system. You drive. You take your depleted battery out. A full battery comes on. And you drive on.
"The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense. It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash, takes it out, puts it back in. Within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again. If you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money."
"The electric car has a battery bay that costs the same as the gas tank. The crude oil is replaced with a battery. It has 2,000 life cycles these days. In Europe where taxes are in place, that's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel."

"The price of oil, much like lots of other curves that we've seen, goes along a depletion curve. The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground. And we keep getting well that are farther away from the ground, he says. It becomes more and more expensive to dig them out."
"The U.S. is using 25 million barrels of oil a day, or 0.5 percent of the world's use. The world needs 1 million hybrid cars by 2015, but that won't do much difference, he says. ""We take our money and we give it away,"" he says of oil prices."
"The U.S. car industry has been focused just on themselves, he says. ""We're the only ones who don't have the price set right,"" he adds. The world is bringing in so many cars, the industry will grow from 100,000 cars in 2011 to 10 million cars by 2016."
"Car 2.0 will subsidize the price of the car, just like cellphones. The cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars. In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills, not from oil. In Israel, we've asked to put a solar farm."

"The body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be, at least, submerged naturally. The head is held in line with the spine, so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up. The only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water."

"The project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor -- 99 percent of it done by women. Thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this. A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef, particularly in coral reefs."
"""We're crocheting a coral reef. We did workshops and lectures,"" he says. ""And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own. And it was exhibited alongside ours"" ""There were hundreds of people involved in that. It got completely beyond us,"" he adds."
Coral reefs have a particular kind of structure known as hyperbolic geometry. The only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet. In 1997 a mathematician at Cornell made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet.
"Before hyperbolic geometry, mathematicians knew about two kinds of space: Euclidean space, and spherical space. Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible. The project now reaches across three continents, and its roots go into the fields of mathematics, marine biology, feminine handicraft and environmental activism."
"How many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line? mathematicians have answered that question. They've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness, it's called a geodesic. A straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw on a sphere."
"In 1997, Daina Taimina showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space. The development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth. February 2009 is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin."
"The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non-Euclidean geometry. Even mathematicians, who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers, couldn't see not only the sea slugs around them, but the lettuce on their plate."

When he was five years old he fell in love with airplanes. The product was that airplane. Even the parts of the airplane had French names. It's the way I got a part of this romance. I think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product.
"In the '30s, the only way to fly an airplane was to draw it. ""I could produce a model that would fly, stay in the air. And it had, once it was in theAir, some of this romance that I was in love with,"" he says."
"phthalmologist: ""I wanted to get back where the romance was"" ""I went into art because they appreciated drawing. Studied painting; didn't do very well at that. Went through design, some architecture. Eventually hired myself out as a designer. After 25 years I began to feel as though I was running dry. And I quit."
"""I started with a lot of loose ideas, roughly eight or nine years ago,"" he says. ""The loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office"" ""When I was doing those model airplanes, I did everything. I basically engineered it. I built it. And that's the way I work now,"" he adds."

"I felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted. I worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc -- that is up and down -- and make them a lot easier, so that you didn't have to use a button. After many trials, many failures, we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other."
"The more you can recline, in a way, the better it is, he says. All the weight of your upper torso -- your arms, your head -- goes right down through your back, your spine, into those bones. Just relieving your arms with armrests takes 20 percent of that load off."
"When you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end, and transfer it to your back. At the same time, as I say, you open up this joint. But to do that, if you have any amount of recline, you need a headrest."
"Gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load. We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair? Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country? The answer is: it is at least partially fair."
"In Louisiana, about one in five white voters said, ""Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American"" If those people had voted for Obama, even half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely. The same is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list."
"Income, religion, education, and type of neighborhood all play a role. States with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red, and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region, is less educated. And you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns."
"In cites, about 80 percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race. In rural communities, only about 30 percent. People who don't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do."
"Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races. Not everyone wants to live in a city, certainly not a city like New York. So we can think more about things like street grids."
"There are big differences between how Bill Clinton did in '96 and how Barack Obama did in 2008. Obama did better than John Kerry in Massachusetts, but not as well as McCain in Arizona. There are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU, have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas."
"Ushahidi is a crowdsourcing tool for eyewitness accounts of events in real time. It is being used by NGOs all over East Africa, small NGOs doing their own little projects. Four of the five people who are full time members at Ushahidis were TED Fellows."

"The sound of a click is commonly described as a ""dental consonant of no Indo-European language"" In the 1950s they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls. We're building for smartphones, so that it can be used in the developed world as well as the developing world."
The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature. It has a deep melancholy ring. Children don't like it. Adults find it comforting. But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wallswitch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship?

"In the 1970s, a group of young men in New York City decided to build a replica of the Eiffel Tower. The project was a success and the men were able to move on to other projects. In the 1990s, they decided to move the project back to New York, where it was originally built."
Growth extended to almost all parts of the world at the beginning of the 21st century. Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China. China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program over the last three decades.
"At the end of the 20th century, growth in Africa was negative. Today, new ideas are driving growth on the cutting edge. This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important, more powerful than ever before. And there's reasons for optimism, because the best is yet to come."
"There are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases. The reason for this is incentives. If China and India were as rich as the United States is today, the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger. Larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas."
"The U.S. has been an idea leader, but is losing its leadership, he says. Globalizing the world is one way to maximize the incentive to produce new ideas, Obama says. ""One idea, one world, one market. That's one reason why we need to globalize trade,"" he adds. ""How else can we create new ideas? Well, more idea creators"""
"For too long the United States, and a handful of other developed countries, have shouldered the entire burden of research and development. If the world as a whole were as wealthy as the U.S. is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers."
"Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas, the incentive to create new ideas. Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas, he says. Even at that rate, by 2100 average GDP per capita in the world will be $200,000."
In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy. In the second half of the 20th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half. We globalized the world. It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries; we made the world more cooperative.
"The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today, than ever in the past, he says. The U.S. has a particularly important role to play in this: to keep our education system globalized, he adds."
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled. The child's native language is such a case is not English. It's not Japanese. The brain specializes for it. It creates a representation of language crap. And then the child is stuck with it.
"The native language for a child with such a brain is degraded. It's not English, it's noisy English. Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain. They are going to have poor reading skills. The point is is that you can train the brain out of this."
"About 15,000 children are being trained as we speak. The impact in the distribution, if you trained every child in the United States, would be to shift the whole distribution to the right and narrow the distribution. The training also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production."
"The brain is a machine that we all have residing in our skulls. Scientists can train the brain of an 80- to 90-year-old person for 30 hours. The results are substantial improvements in memory, attention and language abilities. The brain can be trained in hundreds of thousands, potentially millions of ways."
"phthalmologist: Most people who are at risk for senility, more or less immediately, are now in a protected position. My issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers, because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale."
"Scientists say our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments. Scientists study this by engaging the brains of animals like rats, or monkeys, or of this particularly curious creature -- one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth -- to learn new skills."
"The brain is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared. It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today. The first great epoch is commonly called the ""Critical Period"" This is the period in which the brain is setting up its basic processing machinery."
"The brain is designed to process information in a certain way. It is not designed to be able to process all the information at the same time. This is why it takes time for the brain to learn how to deal with different types of information, such as sounds."
"Researchers in Marseilles, France, trained a monkey in a task equivalent to a child learning to handle a spoon. The monkey eventually mastered the task in about 700 practice tries. It had a success rate of about one in eight tries at first."
"Researchers reconstructed the responses, location by location, in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons. The monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged. There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on."
"The changes are massive. There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this. It represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain. This is constructed by physical change."
The brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context. Billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver. The brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time. It's all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization.
The majority of children that have early language impairments struggle to learn to read. The reason is because early in the baby's brain's life the machine process is noisy. There are numerous inherited faults that could make theMachine process noisier.

LG: We don't actually know what the lethality was of the 1918 strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans. The virus clearly went through one round around the world in a mild enough form that the British army in World War I actually certified that it was not a threat.
"Virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families, if you will, of the H5N1 viral tree. At no time in history have we succeeded in making in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine for more than 260 million people."
"After 9/11, when the airports closed, our flu season was delayed by two weeks. We're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu we've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat of the infected animals. It mimics what we now understand about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus."
"55 percent of people who have become infected with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed. Most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age. Only 15 states have been certified to be able to do mass distribution of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic."
"Nobody knows who's in charge in the event of a pandemic. The government says it's a guy called the Principle Federal Officer, who happens to be with TSA. Most local facilities would all be competing to get their hands on a drug called Tamiflu."
We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus. The vaccine will probably be useless. What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers to take care of patients? The British government did a model of telecommuting.
We don't know how important hand washing is for H5N1 flu. We don't have a standard for what should be the protective gear for the first responders. We need to find a way to make sure we don't get sick.
"Tamiflu is counteractive to public health measures, making matters worse. Only 20 percent is metabolized appropriately to be an active compound in the human being. Russia has stockpiled enough for 95 percent of all Russians. The pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months."
At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1. The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women and we don't actually know why. Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds -- robustly healthy young adults.
"CNN's John Sutter says the U.S. is not ready for a pandemic. Sutter: ""I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything"" ""I think it's about having to be prepared as communities, not as individuals,"" he says."
"Laurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know. The virus eventually attenuates, and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity, and finds other hosts. The British banking plan showed that telecommuting can be helpful. But can you sustain your company that way?"
LG: The moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission is the time to send out the alert. The mechanism isn't clear. LG: There is some evidence that taking Lipitor and other common statins for cholesterol control may decrease your vulnerability to influenza.
The LHC is the world's largest superconducting magnets. It is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year. The LHC will be used to study the formation of atoms and molecules in the universe. It will also help scientists understand how the universe formed.
"LHC's ATLAS detector is 44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter. The first beam particle went all the way around the LHC, colliding with a piece of the. LHC deliberately, and showering particles into the detector."
Researchers looked at the patterns of attacks in different conflicts. They found the same pattern emerged in all of them. The researchers say they don't know why Iraq has the pattern it does. They hope to use their findings to improve understanding of war.
"Physicists used data from around the world to create an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack. They found that not only were the distributions these straight lines, but the slope of these lines, they clustered around this value of alpha equals 2.5."
"New Zealander says group dynamics can explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world. "" insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt. And it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy,"" he says."
"The surge was supposed to push Alpha up, but the opposite happened. The groups became stronger. They became more robust. The system gets perturbed. It moves upwards to a fragmented state. It's moved up again. It tells me one of two things."
CNN's John Defterios has been working on a story about the use of drones in the Middle East. He says the story could be used to shed light on how the U.S. military is using drones. The story will be published in a special edition of CNN.com's iReport.
"I was exploring, really early on, wanting to make things float in the air. I have a sort of a collection of videos that I took of different installations, which I could narrate. This is a sculpture of the Sun and the Earth, in proportion."
"This is a slice from the equator of the Earth. This is the size of the Sun. This one is about the Moon and then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also. And this is a bronze ball, an aluminum arm here, and then this wooden disk."
"The sculptures are based on the structure of a diamond. The spheres are suspended, but have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses. The wooden disk was really thought about as something that you'd want to hold on to, and that would glide easily through your hands."
"This is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball, that would be directed around the room by a computer. This is a clock that turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth. This has a diamond-bottomed lake. This would be grown, I suppose, with nanotechnology in the future."
"The flying airship is about 35 meters in diameter, about 110 feet in diameter. The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes, red, blue, and green. The cabin is open or closed, as you like. It can generate about a million kilowatts."
"The sphere is silent and nonpolluting. It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system. The default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution Earth image. It would also be able to be an open code, so people could interact with it."
"Glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica are melting faster than ever. The arctic ice cap has shrunk by 40 percent in the last three million years. The entire continent is now in negative ice balance, according to scientists. In the Andes, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city."
"In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours to the oceans. The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforestation, is the burning of fossil fuels. Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem."
"The coal and oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal. The arctic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system. The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal."
"Coalergy is spending money to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal. While burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge."
"The U.S. needs to cut its dependence on fossil fuels, says Al Gore. He wants to create a clean energy grid that can provide jobs for Americans. He says it's time for a new generation of leaders to take charge of the country."
"Gore: methane is actively bubbling up out of the water in some shallow lakes in Alaska. Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. The question is whether we will be."
"This is an image from Tuscany, where we feel agriculture is still about beauty. And we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past. Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image. Of course, the reality is quite different."
"It was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Bread is something which is as simple as our basic, most fundamental human staple. White bread symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all."
In the U.S. less than 1% of the population lives on bread. The number of people living on bread has increased by 25% since the 1970s. The U.N. says the rise in bread production has led to a rise in the number of hungry people.
Bread is the most important crop in the world. It is a source of calories and of modern life. It has become a symbol of the modern world. But it is also a symbol for the destruction of nature. It's time to change the way we eat bread.
"Bread was invented by farmers in Iraq and Syria in particular. ""We have become very removed from what our bread really is,"" he says. ""The fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about,"" he adds. ""I would love to go back to Tuscany to this kind of traditional setting, gastronomy, good food"""
"""We do not want to relegate the urban poor to starvation,"" says Swedish politician. ""We cannot just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem"" ""The main driver of that is actually meat,"" he adds."
"We must feed three billion people in cities. We will not do that through small farmers' markets, he says. We need clever low-key mechanization that avoids the problems of large-scale mechanization. We've moved from small-scale and low-control agriculture to large- scale and very high control."
We need more science and not less. We need good science. We have much cleverer irrigation. We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to. And we need to think very dispassionately about the advantages of small-scale and large-scale.
"I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements. I want to have horticulture and greenhouses on top of residential areas. There are all kinds of ways we can do it. Food is as important as energy, as security, as the environment."

"The idea of tribes is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years. It's about leading and connecting people and ideas and it's something that people have wanted forever. This method -- mass marketing -- requires average ideas, because you're going to the masses."
"The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all. Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest. You've got the red-hat ladies over there. And you've got people in white hats making food. And again, I couldn't go."
"Gore: ""It's tribes -- not money, not factories -- that can change our world"" Kelley: ""You don't need everyone. What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need, I don't know, a thousand true fans"""

"AIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983. In the last two to three years, we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world. The steady state is, more or less, one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected."
"Despite PEPFAR, all people are not reached by treatment. Of those who are reached, only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years. It's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries. It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it."
HIV/AIDS rates in Africa are much higher than in the U.S. and the rest of the world. Why is it so high? Is it war? Or is it poverty? The answers to these questions lie in the statistics.
"HIV is more common with multiple partners, there is less condom use, and there is age-disparate sex. We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries. The highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected."
"UNAIDS have done good data available, finally, about the spread of HIV. The risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000. But if you are in an unfavorable situation, more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100."
"HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore, having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others. HIV has a terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years. Uganda had almost five percent infected and was probably the most infected country in the world."
"In the '60s and '70s we thought of people as a burden, he says. Today we talk of them as an asset, he adds. This change in thinking of human capital is linked to India's demographic dividend. As healthcare improves, as infant mortality goes down, fertility rates start dropping."
"India is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster. A demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital. Only if the people have education, they have good health and infrastructure can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend."
"Technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something that is empowering. Forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge. In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation. And therefore democracy has become embedded."
"Six factors have contributed to why India is growing at rates it has never seen before. The rise of population as human capital, the rise of Indian entrepreneurs, and English as a language of aspiration are just a few of the factors that have led to India's growth."
"20 years back the political slogan was, ""Roti, kapada, makaan,"" which meant, ""Food, clothing and shelter"" Today's political slogan is, ""Bijli, sadak, pani,"" which means ""Electricity, water and roads"" Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city."
"The ideas of primary education, infrastructure, urbanization, and single market are ideas in India which have been accepted, but not implemented. The ideas that we argue about are the arguments we have which cause gridlock. The labor policies that we have, which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies, need to be fixed."
Indian higher education is completely regulated. It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India. India has equally horrible health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue and diabetes. India can look at what is happening in the west and elsewhere to see what needs to be done.
"The world has to stabilize at something like 20 gigatons per year, he says. On a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year. India is already at two tons a year. But if India grows at. something like eight percent, income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050."
"When India was growing at 3.5 percent, its per capita income was doubling every 45 years. When the economic growth goes to 8 percent and population growth drops to 1.5% then per capita Income is doubling every nine years. And you must have a clear strategy which is important for India and important for the world."

"In cognitive illusions, it's much, much harder to demonstrate the mistakes to people. The argument is in those cases, it might be that we actually make many more mistakes. Countries that we think about as very similar, actually exhibit very different behavior. Why do some countries give a lot and some countries giving a little?"

"By definition, these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die. It's difficult and it's complex. And because we have no idea what to do, we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us. The effect also happens to experts in their decisions, and who make a lot of them."

"The Danish National Committee for Pig Production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her, you will see a six-percent increase in the farrowing rate. The clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina, so this may be titillating for her."

"""America has done more for me financially than Britain ever has, or ever could have done,"" he writes. ""I find myself automatically defending the USA from the sneers of green-eyed Europhiles playing their Greek card to Roman trumps,"" he adds. ""Never was there one so fair!"""
"Hail to the gods of the dream. But which of them reigns supreme? Which is America's Jupiter? The Brahmins of Capital Hill? A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street? But who was the better man, old boy? Or is it celebrity status?"
The poem was written in the early 20th century. It was written by a man who was angry at injustice. The poem is written in rhyming couplets. The author says the poem upsets him every time he reads it. He says he is not a father but has 22 godchildren.
"The poet was in a clinic with a life-threatening illness in October of 2000. He begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse and a pencil and pen to write his first poem. ""I wined and dined them, like pigs in a sty,"" he writes. ""Love came to visit me, shy as a fawn, she fled with the dawn"""
"I love to think what it was like to be a Neanderthal. I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman, who men fall down, you know. But sometimes I try to put myself in that position. I was the better at rolling a reefer."
"I spent eight years running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world. I never did anything to anyone that wasn't already corrupted. I took crack cocaine, every single night for seven years. It was like Dante's ""Inferno"""

"Human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days. But I think we're in for another change, about two generations after the top of that curve. At that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again, instead of the nasty, brutish past."
"World's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century. Fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet. A declining population means scarce labor. Scarce labor drives wages."
"""We must change everything. Look around the room: chairs, wood, everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem,"" he says. ""When they have their kids, 2050, they'd better look back at Grandpa and say, ""Hey, you gave it a good shot"""

"Every year in the USA, roughly 2,500 children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles. An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off, until an intelligent plug is detected. The appliance's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug."
"Intelligent power will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business. Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location, or even a cell phone. Every year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured with 350,000 home fires."
"Faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring are main causes of residential fires. Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879. Over 80 percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers. Any electrical device -- an appliance, an extension cord, whatever -- must be able to tell the power outlet, ""Hey, power outlets, I'm drawing too much current"""
The rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon. That whole dopamine-wanting system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system. People who underwent what is called a quantum change: they felt their life and their whole values had changed.
"Psychology professor: ""We are wired to pursue happiness, not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it"" World Health Organization predicts by 2020 that depression will be the second largest cause of disability. People are more averse to losing than they are happy to gain. The formula for a happy marriage is five positive remarks for every one negative."
"We're wired for dangers that are immediate, that are imminent, and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where opioids come in. We tend to think of emotions as just feelings. But in fact, emotions are an all-systems alert that change what we remember, what kind of decisions we make."
"Happiness is not just the absence of misery. It's a whole other end of the equation. And it's been missing from psychotherapy. We are very sensitive to the negative, but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity. We're also born pleasure-seekers."
"Babies are born with a lot of innate pleasures. They like to look at beautiful faces rather than plain faces. There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes, but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for. We have basically at least two systems here, and they both are very ancient."
"In 1995, illegal drugs were a $400 billion business, representing eight percent of world trade, roughly the same as gas and oil. The pleasure system, as you see, which is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin, is widely spread throughout the brain. Extroverts use it more than introverts."
"Psychology professor: People are happiest when in flow, when they're absorbed in something out in the world. Studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain. There is a profound need to belong to a group, he says."
"Human genes don't care whether we're happy, they care that we replicate, that we pass our genes on. The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status. We are very aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it."
"The first synthetic self-cleaning, dry adhesive has been made. Lynn Verinsky used these on smooth surfaces to climb up, and pull herself up. Kellar Autumn, a former Ph.D. student, gave his first-born child up for this test."
"Stickybot uses a new hierarchical dry adhesive. It uses the toe peeling, just like the gecko does. The engineers told us, for the climbing robots, that, if they don't have a tail, they fall off the wall."
"Tails are used to store fat, grab onto things and provide static balance. They can also act as a counterbalance, as in this kangaroo's case. The tail can also be active, as seen in this robot. It's a story about beyond biomimetics, to something I'm calling biomutualism."
"Myhrvold: 'The tail is a whip for communication. It can also be used in defense' 'It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg, and it contributes to stability' 'If you make it slip a huge amount, this is what we discovered'"
"Researchers built a robot with a tail to test the world's fastest air-righting response. The robot had a zero-angular-momentum righting response, which is like a cat falling. Scientists say that as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature, nature becomes a much more useful teacher."
"The animal has no gliding adaptations, so we thought, ""Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel and see what it does"" It does an equilibrium glide. It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin. It can actually swim through the air."
Researchers in Singapore and Southeast Asia have found evidence of flapping flight in nature. The first video shows an animal gliding down a tree in a wind tunnel. It's the first time the scientists have seen the animal move towards the landing target in this way.
"The gecko uses its tail too, just like we saw in the lab. The individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends. We must preserve nature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. We need to redesign education in a major way."
"""I was outwardly very successful, but inwardly very depressed. I bought a fast car. It didn't help. I was faster but just as depressed,"" he says. ""It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me"""
"With no employees, there was nobody for me to manage. So I went back to doing the projects I loved. I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short, did all the things that took me back up to success. But it wasn't a quick trip. It took seven years."
"Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work. But then I stopped because I figured, ""Hey, I'm good enough. I don't need to improve any more"" And the only thing that came was creative block."
"In 1991, eight people went into a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module. We needed to know, is life this malleable? Can you take this biosphere, that has evolved on a planetary scale, and jam it into a little bottle, and will it survive?"
"The day I walked into Biosphere 2, I was, for the first time, breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world, except seven other people. I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again. I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way."
"We were growing plants like crazy. We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere. We had lost seven tons of oxygen. And we had no clue where it was. We stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could. And our oxygen went down quite far."
"""We're not dead. We're fine,"" he tells CNN. ""You stop breathing and then you -- (Gasps) -- take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating"" ""I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time,"" he says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his time at the Biosphere. Sutter: ""We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost"" ""We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable. We all went quite nuts,"" he says."
"In Biosphere 2 he lived in a three-acre, entirely sealed, miniature world for two years and 20 minutes. He had no idea what was in his food, where it came from and didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that he was eating. The legacy of that is a system that we were designing: a system to grow plants to grow on Mars."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia. He saw a company that had taken seawater and sand, and they were growing a crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it. The mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals."
"""Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation, from what I would call a biocidal species"" ""We're in the process of transforming from this to a biophilic society,"" he says. ""It may not seem like it, but we are. It is happening all across the world"""
"""We're very uncomfortable with untidiness. And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property,"" he says. ""It's a certain type of aesthetic. And so now all the birds come in, and I have an oasis"" ""I've been building topsoil. And over time, essentially, essentially what have I been doing? I've been trying to build a garden"""
"Tucson's biosphere is in a riparian area. The Industrial Revolution has given us the ability to look at the world from the outside, he says. ""Breath does, in fact, connect us all in a very literal way,"" he adds."
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks about the transformed media landscape. He says the moment we're living through is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history. The question we all face now is, ""How can we make best use of this media?"""
"Only four periods in the last 500 years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label ""revolution"" These include the printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, radio and television. The media that is good at creating conversations is no good for creating groups."
"The Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. Media is increasingly less just a source of information, and it is increasingly more a site of coordination. Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well."
People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings. The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter. The last time China had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened.
Citizen journalists in Sichuan started reporting on the earthquake. They found that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow building to be built to less than code. The Chinese government eventually cracked down on the citizen journalists. The one-child policy in China has radicalized many people.
"China is probably the most successful manager of Internet censorship in the world. The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared. Now the Chinese government is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services, because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous."
"Most media is now global, social, ubiquitous and cheap. The size of the network is actually the square of the number of participants. It is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content. We saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during Obama campaign."
Obama's supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk. Within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com. People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down. Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join.
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks to the victims of the Jonestown massacre. He says the tragedy has left him wondering what happened to his own brain. Bouldens: ""What happened to my brain? I don't know what happened"""
"""I understand how someone's brain ... can come to the place where it makes sense,"" he says. ""It would be wrong, when your brain is working like that -- not to try to save the world through genocide"" ""These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable,"" he adds."
" neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. We're beginning to look inside the brain. And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection, I am convinced it would look very, very different."
"Walter Mischel was arrested for kidnapping after five years as a deprogrammer. Mischel: Two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation. The others, of course, wait. The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT."
"Time perspective is the study of how individuals, all of us, divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories. For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation, what other people are doing and what you're feeling. For others, the present is irrelevant."
The paradox of time perspective is something that influences every decision you make. There are two ways to be present-oriented: past-oriented and future-oriented. The optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots.
"TED Talk: Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives. What you get from the present hedonism is the energy, the energy to explore yourself, places, people, sensuality. ""I am more energetic than ever, more productive, and I'm happier than I have ever been"""
"Philip Zimbardo: ""It's all about yielding, resisting, now, later, impulsive, reflective, present focus and future focus"" ""I don't know, guys. I don't want to get in trouble,"" he says. ""Take a bite. One bite"""
"The politics become easier as the decade progresses if you're building on a foundation of security and economic development. The mentality of politics has to shift from zero-sum to positive-sum before you can get a productive politics. In order to build prosperity, we need security in place."
"The Security Council is responsible for providing the peacekeepers who build the security. The second actor, different cast of guys, is the donors. The donors provide post-conflict aid. Typically in the past, the donors have been interested in the first couple of years, then they got bored."
"40 percent of all post-conflict situations, historically, have reverted back to conflict within a decade. During conflict economic policy typically deteriorates. Governments snatch short-term opportunities and, by the end of the conflict, the chickens have come home to roost."
"In a post-conflict situation, needs are everywhere, but the capacity to implement change is very limited. So we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical. Jobs, health, and clean government are the three critical priorities."
"Post-conflict situations often revert to conflict because young men have nothing to do. The construction sector has a vital role, obviously, in reconstruction. But any activity open to international trade is basically going to be uncompetitive in a post-Conflict situation."
"During conflict people are doing destruction. There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away. When you try and expand it, because it's shriveled away, you encounter a lot of bottlenecks. The first thing that is prioritized is politics."
"There has been a sort of a schizophrenia in the donor community, as to how to build basic services in post-conflict sectors. On the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s. Neither of those approaches is sensible."
"Short-term peacekeepers would be co-branded as being done by the post-conflict government, in the country. The government would be funding it, it would beCo-branding these services. The typical post-Conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life-support system."
Focus on the construction sector would have produced both jobs and security. The emphasis on clean government would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks. The focus on the basic service delivery would have rescued basic services from their catastrophic levels. Gradually it would shift from a politics of plunder to a Politics of hope.
"This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time. I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is, what it could be, and what your relationship to it is. This is, of course, to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce."
"TED Talk: Warren Buffet's giving challenges the idea that philanthropy is only for the wealthy. There are now so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing. Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy, says TED Talk founder."
"Philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes, says David Cameron. The new zeitgeist is open, big, fast, connected, and, let us also hope, long, he says. Cameron: We're not thinking our way into a new way of acting; we're acting our way."
"The social singularity may be the one that we fear the most, says David Frum. The future of our civilization is in our hands as never before, he says. Frum: We can create a future where hope and history rhyme."
I want to show you a photo of two men I believe to be the most important people in the world. They were the men who helped create the world as we know it. And they were the ones who made the world a better place. I want you to see them in this photo.
"A month ago today I stood there: 90 degrees south, the top of the bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole. A couple of buddies of mine and I had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert. We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa affected young people."
"Richard and Ray set the world speed record for a trek to the South Pole. Richard: ""We huddled into that tent, 45 below that day, I'll never forget it"" ""We were burning about 8,500 a day, so we needed it"""
"The journey took 33 days, 23 hours and 55 minutes to get to the South Pole. ""I know that we can make the impossible possible. I'm learning this at 40 years of age,"" he says. ""Imagine being 13 years old, hearing those words, and believing it"""
"I think if our students, if our high school students -- if all of the American citizens -- knew about probability and statistics, we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus."
"Every student who studies math, science, engineering, should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college. But few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives. Building is at the heart of the experience: hands on, deeply immersed and fully committed."
"Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects, and be trusted. The school doesn't follow a set curriculum, and there are no tests. Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined."
"Daniel Libeskind: ""I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others, looking at America from that point of view"" ""I think architecture is about consensus. And it is about the dirty word ""compromise."" Compromise is not bad,"" he says."
"Daniel Libeskind: ""I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero will be meaningful, will be inspiring"" ""It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future,"" he says. ""You don't always win everything you want to win. But you can steer the process"""
"Architecture is suspended between what we believe we can be, and a tradition we may have forgotten. Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know. Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile, but to reach out across the abyss of history."
"""I think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses"" ""I think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space"" ""There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture. I've always been an opponent of it. Life without emotion would really not be life"""
"Architecture is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write. Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story, but the story is very short, which says ""We have no story to tell you"""
"I believe that the hand has a source, though the source is unknown, though we don't have to be mystical about it. I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is. There is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple."
"The political is not an enemy of architecture, says the architect. Architecture is not only the giving of answers, it's also, just like life, the asking of questions. It's the real that we touch -- the door, window, threshold, the bed -- such prosaic objects."
"Sustainability can translate into a raw space, a space that is not mannered in any source. Create a space for an office that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real. Architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil."
"Architecture is based on wonder, not bluntness, says the architect. He says the power of architecture is to transform even a very small space. ""Without memory we would be amnesiacs. We would not know which way we were going,"" he says."
" architectural mission is to create spaces that are vibrant, that are pluralistic, that can transform the most prosaic activities. The memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is. It's not only our memory, but those who remember us, which means that architecture is not mute."
" architectural risk is 'what underlies the world', says architect. 'It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be' 'It's carving out a space where nature can enter the domestic world of a city,' he says."
"I don't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes. I am a believer in democracy. I would not have liked somebody to say, ""This is the tabula rasa, mister architect -- do whatever you want"" It's such a complex project. There is so many interests. There are emotions of the victims."
"Eames Demetrios: Charles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife. The first line in Charles' narration was, ""From the sky, our cities look much the same"" The Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate happened about 50 feet from where this was shown."
The Eames family is known for their hand-made furniture. Charles Eames designed the chairs for the Eames Museum in New York. The Eames' furniture was inspired by traditional folk design. The museum is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.
"Charles Eames is celebrating his 100th birthday this week. The Eames design process for Charles and Ray never ended in manufacturing. They were always trying to make thing better and better. It's not enough to create one, you've got to create a system."
"Charles and Ray Kamen designed a molded plywood splint. They learned a lot about the manufacturing process, which was incredibly important to them. Charles and Ray, they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake. They didn't say, ""Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy"""
"The Eames family focused on the need, not the style, to solve the design problem, ED says. Charles Eames used to say, ""The extent to which you have a design style is the extent toWhich you have not solved thedesign problem"" The Eames' film ""Powers of Ten"" is a film they made in the 1960s."
"E.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants -- he loved them, of course, and he wanted to learn more about them -- he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale. And I think in our family we were very lucky, because we learned about design backwards."
"Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear. Lower right is a solar do-nothing toy. Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys. ED: Awl, also, good that the leather crafter's guild is here."
" ED: ""I saw many trains and also rode on one"" ""I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party"" ""Kymaerica"" is a reinterpretation of the landscape. ""Since it's bronze it has to be true,"" he says."

"The eye visually interrogates what we look at. The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model. So, for example, when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around to selectively create a visual logic."
The Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches that were made by two visual artists. The lessons for us are three-fold. Use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate. Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully. And the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence.
"David Sibbet from The Grove and Kevin Richards, from Autodesk, made 650 sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter's ideas. No Powerpoint is used in two days. Instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on."
"This year's theme is ""Why does the brain create meaning?"" This week, we look at how the brain sees the world through the eyes. We also look at the role of art in helping people understand the world around them. We'll end the week with a look back at some of the most memorable images of the year."
Vietnam is the only country in the world where money has been banned from being used. The ban was imposed after the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1975. The U.S. government has been trying to get the ban lifted since then.
"Khmer Rouge took family from Pursat to Kaoh Tiev, across from the border from Vietnam. There they had a detention camp where alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested. My mother's Vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible, she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names."
The Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia killed one and a half million people in the 1970s and 1980s. The complaint against the regime was accepted by a tribunal last month. The tribunal will now decide whether or not the case should go to trial.

"The rise of the West, dramatic as it was, is over, says Kenyatta. The villages of the world are emptying out, he says. Subsistence farming is drying up, and people are following opportunity into town. In town they see action. They see opportunity."
"The slums are ""intensely urban"" and ""creatively creative,"" he says. ""They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm"" ""They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by. They even build their own infrastructure"""
"The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty. These are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can. They're doing it through an outlaw thing, the informal economy. The scale is terrific. It's much more interactive."
"In Dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself, but it performs services for the city at large. Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private, tiny, unofficial school. We should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world. If we don't, they will go toward the criminal world."

"Coal is what is causing the climate problems. Wind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy. If we can eventually get good solar in space, that also could help. This year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today."
"The developing world is busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors. The Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors, for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia. These are not only small, they are proliferation-proof."
"Nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity. By mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban, and that's mostly in the developing world. Genetically engineered food crops have no reason to be controversial."
"CNN's John Defterios says geoengineering is taboo now, but it will be on your plate soon. The developing world now has all of the biggest cities, and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries, he says. Defterio: If we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization."
"In 1992, there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs known as the Pinatubo cubs. To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year. The first words of Whole Earth Discipline are, ""We are as Gods, and have to get good at it"""

"The artist threw some green dye in the river in L.A., Stockholm, Norway and Tokyo. The ""Green river"" was really about showing people, in this city, as they walk by, that space has dimensions. The water has an ability to make the city negotiable."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a series of projects in Iceland. He has also been working in Berlin on a project to make a car out of ice. Defterio: ""If you stand still, the landscape doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is"""
"Life in Space is an annual gathering of people from all over the world. The aim is to give the city a sense of dimension and make it seem as big as possible. ""It makes a difference whether you have a body that feels a part of a space, rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture"""
"phthalmologist says art and culture can create a space which is both sensitive to individuality and to collectivity. ""It's very much about the way we link thinking and doing,"" he says. ""Having an experience is taking part in the world. It's about being together"""
"The Marrow Miner is a catheter that can be used to suck bone marrow from the hip. The device uses a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around."
"The Marrow Miner was just FDA approved in the last year. Marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells. Adult stem cells are throughout our body, including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow. In the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat other diseases."
Jill Bolte Taylor is the founder of the Marrow Miner. She uses bone marrow from healthy people to fight cancer. She hopes the new technology will encourage more people to become bone marrow donors. She says it could also be used to save lives in the future.
"The MAO-A gene is linked to violence. It's on the X chromosome. You can only get it from your mother. This is probably why mostly men, boys, are psychopathic killers, or are very aggressive. If you have this gene, in utero your brain is bathed in this, so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin."
"Neuroscientist: ""In order to express this gene, in a violent way, very early on, before puberty, you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic"" ""After several generations, and here is the idea, we really have a tinderbox,"" he says."
"The first murder of a mother by a son was my great-great-great.great- great-grandfather. There were seven more men, on my father's side, starting then, Cornells, that were all murderers. The moral of the story is: people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones."
"CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta has been studying the brains of psychopathic people. He has found that some of them have the same brain structure as their siblings. Gupta: ""There's gonna be bad news somewhere. And we don't know where it is"""
"Charles Darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man, in a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world. He rejected the idea that human skin pigmentation was related to the climate. And how you end up with a psychopath, and a killer, depends on exactly when the damage occurs."
"The TOMS 7 satellite data show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface. The data has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation. The earliest members of our lineage, the genus Homo, were darkly pigmented, two million to one and half million years ago."
"Melanin, in various forms, has probably been on the Earth a billion years, and has been recruited over and over again by evolution. Melanin was recruited, in our lineage, and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa, to be a natural sunscreen."
"People in the Northern Hemisphere have no ability to make vitamin D in their skin. Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once, not just twice, but probably three times. Humans have been on the move for a long time, in increasing rates, over increasing distances."
"Between 1520 and 1867, 12 million, 500 people were moved from high UV to low UV areas in the transatlantic slave trade. Some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high-UV areas, others in low- UV areas. These have tremendous consequences for our health. Vitamin D deficiency causes all sorts of health problems."
"200 years after Darwin's birthday, we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States. He resembles, very closely, people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern Africa, or Southeast Asia. These people have a tremendous potential to tan, as a result of exposure to sun."
"Darwin knew that skin color was one of the most important ways in which people varied. What these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others, however distantly. What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see."
"I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith, and people of no faith. What I think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves. Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full."
"In the last 10 years, mobile phones have helped bring down regimes around the world. Bloggers in Burma, Iran and Zimbabwe have also helped change the world, he says. Foreign policy cannot be run by elites; it's got to be run on the opinions of the public, he adds."
"Nelson Mandela said there was a greater challenge ahead, the challenge of poverty, of climate change. He said these challenges needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society. We are the first generation which is in a position to do this, he says."
Global economic institutions need to be built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible. We must build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary.
"Neda, the Iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran only a few weeks ago, is now the focus, rightly so, of the YouTube generation. Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy, in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent."
"We should be marching towards a global society. The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors. Most people make a strict correlation between how much time, and if you like, love -- not romantic love, though that may be something -- that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy."
"It's not the material goods we want; it's the rewards we want. The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think, ""This is somebody who's greedy"" We're told, from many sources, that anyone can achieve anything."
"The closer two people are -- in age, in background, in the process of identification -- the more there's a danger of envy. We live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises. There's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality which can make for a very stressful situation."
"A society that tells people that they can do anything, and the existence of low self-esteem, can have a nasty kickback. In other words, your position in life comes to seem not accidental, but merited and deserved. That's exhilarating if you're doing well, and very crushing if you are not."
"It's easier now than ever before to make a good living, says David Frum. Frum: The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded is impossible. ""It's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to,"" he says."
"When we think about failing in life, one of the reasons why we fear failing is the judgment and ridicule of others. Tragic art, as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece, in the fifth century B.C., was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a group of young people about their fascination with Othello. Sutter: ""It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser. He is not a loser, though he has lost his life"" He says the tragedy of modern society is that there is nothing at its center that is non-human."
"""We are the first society to be in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves,"" he says. ""We like to feel in contact with something that is non-human, and that is so deeply important to us"" ""It's an escape from our own dramas,"" he adds."
" Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years. A lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. We should focus in on our ideas, and make sure that we own them."
"Alain De Botton: By all means, success, yes. But let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas of success. Chris Anderson: How do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a ""loser"" with the idea that a society that encourages that has to have some winners and losers?"
"Golan Levin is the creator of the Interstitial Fragment Processor. He says he wants people to use their bodies to explore their own potential. He hopes the project will encourage people to take control of their own destinies. ""I want people to be able to say, 'Who is that person in the mirror?' "" he says."
"People make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth, or with each other, these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air. This is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia, which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have."
"Remark is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows. The idea is you step into a kind of a magic light. And as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech. And they sort of fly away, out of your head."
"All the text you're going to see is real-time generated by the computer, visualizing what he's doing with his voice. The full videos are online if you are interested. The idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for."
"Eyecode is a piece of interactive software in which, if we read this little circle, ""the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left in the previous place"" The idea is that it's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed by different people."
"The Opto-Isolator is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials. Snout is an eight-foot snout, with a googly eye, and inside it's got an 800-pound robot arm."
"The idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you. It's got a computer vision system, and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most. I want people to discover themselves as actors, as creative actors, by having interactive experiences."
"""I'm happy to be here. Thank you very much,"" he says. ""I've got a good reason for being here."" ""It's because I want to talk to you,"" he adds. ""Because I don't want to leave you alone"""
"Paleontologists looked at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids. The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation. Some of it even came from lianas, those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle."
"Darwin's theory of evolution has been called into question by new evidence. Scientists are now trying to figure out what to do with the new information. The new evidence suggests that Darwin's theory is wrong, but that it may have been correct."
"Charles Darwin despised hypothesis-free science. Alister Hardy, a marine biologist, said, ""I think what happened, perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time"" Hardy kept it to himself for 30 years. But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose."
"Most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair are aquatic ones. The dugong, the walrus, the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee. And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa. And you're tempted to think, well perhaps, could that be why we are naked?"
"Human skin is lined with a layer of fat, unlike any other primate, says Attenborough. The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat, which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground, he says. It's the only possible explanation of why humans can become grossly obese, he adds."
"The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds. The aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe, and it is not lunatics fringe at all, says Hardy. ""They are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum,"" he says."
"I've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind, and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths. The answer to that, loud and clear, is, ""Yes! They can all be wrong."" History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong."
"One of three things is going to happen. Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years. That would be very sad. The second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive, and say, ""I've found it"""
"Academia says no. They decided in 1960, ""That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis,"" he says. The professional journals won't touch it with a barge pole. The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked, let alone look for a reason."
"Dawkins: ""You must never be afraid to rock the boat"" He says the reason we can be so well off is because of the power of ideas. ""When we share ideas we all get more,"" he says. ""There is no roadblock, there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination"""
"In North Korea, President Kim Jong-un tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity. He ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates. He was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win-win solution help his country. And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights."
"North Korea and South Korea started out with identical sets of rules. When they separated, they made choices that led to very divergent paths. We as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other, for better, or for worse."
"Income there stayed stagnant, as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world. In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent. But then in the late '70s something changed. The Chinese started catching up very quickly with the United States."
The Chinese government created four special economic zones around Hong Kong. The success of the zones led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy. The proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city. The idea is to create new places with new rules that people can opt in to.
"With that charter, people will move there. The city can be built. And we can scale this model. We can go do it over and over again. To make it work, we need good rules. Those are captured in the charter. We also need the choices for people."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about a new model for international aid. Sutter: The model is all about choices, both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places. In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility, Sutter says."
"Cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth. If we wanted to build cities for another billion people, they would be dots like this. It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in without coercion."
"CNN's John Defterios asks: ""What would you do if you were the president of a country?"" He says the country would have to set up rules to make it possible for people to buy and sell land. The country would also have to find a way to make money from the sale of land."
"I used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base. I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle. I had to make little holes in the base of the needle, to shove his feet in. And that's how I managed to do it."
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold. The eyes are probably about one micron or something. The actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing. The pinhead I've made green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt.
"""I was hiding in the shed, like that. ... And then I saw her legs. And then she said ... ""How come you're not at school?"" ""I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me, and using me as an example of failure"""
"When he discovered that he had this gift, I wanted to experiment with this world that we can't see. So I made all these little apartments and little merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings. And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that."
"CNN's Jim Boulden takes on the challenge of breaking a piece of glass with his bare hands. The result is an image of a broken glass piece that can be used as a model for a new type of microscope. Bouldens: ""We all seem to think that, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there"""
"phthalmologist says he has to slow down his whole nervous system to work on his work. ""I have one-and-a-half seconds to actually move,"" he says. ""And then I work between my heartbeat, I have one and a half seconds to move"""
"I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip. And then I started rubbing, very very gently, till some of the edges were quite square. And how I constructed it, is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead and then pushing the glass in."
"I used a money spider's web to attach certain things, which sent me insane. And when I finished it, I noticed that the house was occupied. And made the beams going around the house. And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed."
"The artist has been sculpting since he was five years old. He works on a molecular level, manipulating the plastic to make it behave differently. After he's cut out the shape, he has to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck."

The Lifesaver bottle is made from sand carved from a grain of sand. The bottle is filled with water that has been filtered down to 200 nanometers. The water is then pumped back into the bottle to provide clean water to people in need. It is the first of its kind in the world.
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at how bacteria and viruses can get through tiny pores in water. The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers. Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers, so nothing is getting through. Defterius: ""If we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this"""
Michael Pritchard uses a jug of dirty water to stir up a bit of the audience's poo. The Lifesaver bottle works really simply. You just scoop the water up. The water comes from a sewage plant farm. It's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
"The Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world. It'll last for 6,000 liters and when it's expired, using failsafe technology, the system will shut off, protecting the user. Michael Pritchard: Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show."
"In a crisis, what do we do? We ship water. Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps. But by thinking differently, and shipping these, people can stay put. They can make their own sterile drinking water, and start to get on with rebuilding their homes."
"With just eight billion dollars, we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid. The same technology, in a jerry can, will process 25,000 liters of water."
"Cody O'Brien: ""I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry. I'd like to show you that through thinking differently, the problem has been solved"" ""It's because, using current thinking, the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving,"" he says. ""So we just switch off: us, governments and aid agencies"""
"""There is lots of love in the air. There's lots of grand openings. And the organisms, I promise you, have all of their priorities in order"" ""I have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this, because he's living, usually on his back, looking up at those grasses"""
"CNN's John Defterios looks at the role of biomimicry in the fight against climate change. Defterio: ""We're not the first ones to make paper, or to try to optimize packing space"" He says people are beginning to realize that nature is doing things that we need to do too."
Hospital-acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the United States than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined. The Galapagos Shark keeps its body free of bacteria build-up with a particular kind of pattern on its skin denticles. The pattern keeps bacteria from being able to land and adhere.
"Cement companies in the U.S. are starting to use CO2 as a building block. They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef, and they're using CO2 in cement, in concrete. Instead of emitting a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement, they're sequestering half a ton."
A new kind of solar cell that's based on how a leaf works. It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever. It's extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years. Every red blood cell of your body has these hourglass-shaped pores called aquaporins. They actually export water molecules through.
G.M. Opel used an algorithm to create a lightweight skeleton for their bionic car. This algorithm has been put into a software program that's now being used to make bridges lightweight. We use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see. In our world we use about 350 polymers.
Insects are being used as consultants in the world of smart grids. A company is looking at how ants and bees find their food and their flowers in the most effective way as a whole hive. A group of scientists in Cornell are making what they call a synthetic tree to move water up without pumps.
"Biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate, says Dr. Adam Neiman. MIT just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips, he says. HOK Architects are looking at building whole cities in their planning department, he adds."

"There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does, says author. The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments, but the drive to do things for their own sake. ""If we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology of carrots and sticks, we can solve a lot of those candle problems,"" he says."
"The key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness. Sam Glucksberg created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science. He gathered his participants and said: ""I'm going to time you, how quickly you can solve this problem"""
Incentives designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity do just the opposite. It dulls thinking and blocks creativity. It's not an aberration. This has been replicated over and over again for nearly 40 years. It doesn't work in some circumstances.
"In the late 1980s, in a moment of youthful indiscretion, I went to law school. I spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation. And I'm telling you, it's not even close. There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does."
"In western Europe, in many parts of Asia, in North America, in Australia, white-collar workers are doing less of this kind of work. That routine, rule-based, left-brain work has become fairly easy to outsource. The solution, if it exists at all, is surprising and not obvious."
"When he got to law school, he didn't do very well. He graduated in the part of his law school class that made the top 90% possible. If you do really well you get the large reward, on down. If-then rewards, the things around which we've built so many of our businesses, don't work."
"Incentives for tasks that involve only mechanical skill worked as expected. But once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill, a larger reward led to poorer performance. People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards."
"Economists at the LSE looked at 51 studies of pay-for-performance plans, inside of companies. They found that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance. The scientists who've been studying motivation have given us this new approach. It's built around intrinsic motivation."
"CNN's John Defterios talks to CNN iReport about self-direction in the workplace. He says the idea of management was invented in the 20th century. But he says it doesn't mean it's going to work forever. Defterio: Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance. If you want engagement, self- Direction works better."

"40 billion of these things built. They fall apart, they disintegrate, and they end up here. The cost per kilowatt-hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds. Early visions of wireless power were thought of by Nikola Tesla basically about 100 years ago."
"Professor came up with concept of resonant energy transfer. Two coils of wire can transfer power magnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance. Dr. Soljacic received a MacArthur Fellowship Award, nicknamed the Genius Award, for his discovery."
"The technology is not a ""radiative"" technology. The magnetic fields we're using are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field. It only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency. And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen."
"A magnetic field can be used to charge cars, credit cards, vacuum cleaners, medical devices. The field can also create a magnetic field on the back of a television set. The technology could be used for medical devices, but who is going to want to plug them in?"
"The device creates a magnetic field. The Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes, sometime in the early 1900s. Dr. Soljacic's original idea was his wife's cellphone beeping. The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety. It causes one to be created out here."
The Google G1 runs the Android operating system. It also has coiled electronics that WiTricity has put into the back of it. The phone is powered completely wirelessly. It has a battery that can last up to 12 hours.

"It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation, probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries. And it's not the economy. The richer 20 percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one. It will never affect a rich person."
"It's much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease. Over the last two years, 2,000 people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region. The world is converging, but -- but -- not the bottom billion, he says."
The world has changed dramatically since the end of World War II. The world has moved from a two-child family to a family of six. But some countries remain back in this area of the world. The U.S. is one of the countries that has not changed.
"Mexico is on par with United States in these two social dimensions. Mexico has the problem that arms are coming from North, across the borders, so they had to stop that, because they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know. The life expectancy was 35 to 40 years, onPar with Afghanistan today."
"The United States and west Europe are getting richer and healthier. The rest of the world remains behind. The fall of life expectancy started 100 years ago, when the U.S. gained independence. The United States is not on par with Mexico, but they are close."
"In China they remember the very embarrassing period, for 100 years, when they went backwards. China could get healthy much earlier, because they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition, and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning. Asia could have social development before they got the economic development."
"This is the income distribution of peoples in the world, from $1 to $10. This is where you have food to eat. These people go to bed hungry. And this is the number of people who are living in poverty. But then you know, I press them like this."
"It's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world, he says. He suggests a slightly different approach of what you would call it. Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Arab states, East Europe, Latin America, and OECD. And on this axis, GDP."
"We have a continuum in the world. East Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries are all on this axis. It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring during 25 years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality.

"Swedish public health professor: ""I would like to show you what happens with the data, what we can show with this data"" Since 1950, during the last 50 years we have had a fall in child mortality. And we had an increase in income."
Sweden has reduced child mortality by 4.7 percent per year. The U.S. has not made as much progress in the last 16 years. Sweden has been the main sponsor of the World Health Organisation's MDG 4.0.

"HIV epidemic in Africa not as bad as Sweden and U.S., says U.N. secretary-general. ""We have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing,"" he says. ""If you have soap, water and food, you know, you can live long,"" he adds."
"In ""Upwake"" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard, clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice. He sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space. He wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist."
"Upwake lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds. There are no special effects in ""Upwake,"" no artifice. It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal. Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later."
"""Upwake"" is a new show that brings theater out of its box and into the world of comic books and video games. ""I know theater unites us. I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives, and I know Theater can heal,"" says the creator."
"Upwake tells the story of Zero, a modern-day business man, stuck between dream and reality. Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry. We are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible."
"""Upwake"" is a new series on CNN.com. This week, CNN's John Sutter looks at the role of diversity in the arts. Sutter: ""We can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent, meaningful work"""
"In the 1800s, farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples. Today, 6,800 of those are extinct, no longer to be seen again. ""Your apple's still out there. Find it. Make sure it doesn't join the list"""
"CNN's John Sutter asks why we don't just save the best apple. Sutter: ""There is no such thing as a best one. Today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease"" ""It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait,"" Sutter says."
"In the future, in many countries, the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past. Is agriculture adapted to that? I don't know. I figured he was either really on to something, or he was one of these academic nutcases."
"By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop in Southern Africa are still in the field, in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change. The good news is that we have conserved a great deal of biological diversity, agricultural diversity."
"The Norwegian government has built a new facility to protect the country's biological diversity. The facility is located in Svalbard, which is 78 degrees north of the capital, Oslo. The aim of the project is to protect Norway's genetic diversity, which has been threatened by climate change."
"It's the raw material, the stuff, of evolution in our agricultural crops. It's a tunnel, and you go into the tunnel, chiseled in solid rock, about 130 meters. There's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now."
"This is a backup system for world agriculture. Storage is free. Norway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed. We're going up to over a million, and someday we'll basically have samples of every variety of agricultural crop."
"""We need to do more to protect the world's biodiversity,"" says the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ""It's a good thing that we're doing what we are doing,"" he says. ""But we have to do it in a way that doesn't destroy the planet's biodiversity"""
"There are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population. The idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem. ""I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved"""
"There are about 30,000 in use now, spread around the world. The technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down. The vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020."
"The World Health Organization estimates 150 million people need glasses. The global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population. The problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a new series on CNN.com called ""This Is Life"" Defterio: ""This is Life"" This is the story of how we got to where we are today, and how we're going to get there."
"There will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year, thousands losing their jobs everyday in America. We've got to do whatever we can to help them, but we've also got to ask whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind of economy."
"Atilla the hen is part of a movement for a different kind of economy. He says it's not so much about consumption and credit, but about things which matter to us. Time banks and parallel currencies are used to link up resources freed up by the market, he says."
"The biggest sector, by far, will be health, predicted to grow to 30 percent by mid-century. Health is founded above all on relationships, rather than simply selling a product. We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis."
"The Open University is one of the world's largest social enterprise groups. It was set up in response to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. It's part of a wider movement of social enterprise in the UK and around the world. The U.S. is the largest of these groups, with more than 100,000 members."
"The idea that all of this represents, I think, is rapidly becoming a common sense. We need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress. I think what this is all about, this whole movement which is growing from the margins, remains quite small."
"In recent years, people thought that capitalism had basically won. But now it's on the verge of being pushed to the margins of society. As you can see with your own eyes, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool. I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades."
"Cymatics can be used to observe and create patterns in nature. Devices like the cymascope have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns. In oceanography, a lexicon of dolphin language is being created by visualizing the sonar beams that dolphins emit."
"Cymatics is accessible to everybody. We can inspire each other. And we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen. It seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere, all around us. And there is thousands of these. I want to urge everybody here to apply your knowledge."
"Cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by vibrating a medium such as sand or water. The field has been explored by Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook and then Ernest Chladni. A fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert, John Stewart Reed, is also an expert."
"Stuntman describes what he considers to be the biggest stunt on Earth. The fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits, have been replaced with modern materials. Car stunts are another area where technology and engineering advances have made life easier for us, and safer."
"The stuntman says being run over is an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt. But padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane help us, when we're hit like this, not to hurt ourselves too much."
"Technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer. Stuntman solution to this in the old days would be, ""Let's hit this as fast as possible. Let's just go for it"" High falls, they're old fashioned stunts, but now they're a much safer proposition."
"Stuntman: ""It's a bouncy castle with slats in the side to allow the air to escape"" ""They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them. They're great for catching you, up to certain heights"""
CNN's John Defterios takes a look back at one of the world's most famous stunts. The stunt was performed by a group of stuntmen in the 1970s and 1980s. It was the first time the stuntmen had been able to perform such a high-speed stunt.
"Stuntman Joe Kittenger is in his 80s and lives in Florida. He's planning to go from 120,000 feet, which is about 22 miles. He says he didn't know if he would live or die in the 1960s."
"At 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly. You need a pressure suit. It took me years to find the right balloon team to build the balloon that would do this job. It's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin. We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps."
The stuntman has had to do a lot of research to find the right suit for the job. He has been training in Morocco in preparation for the high altitude jumps. The stuntman says he will use a three-sided gondola to get to the top.
"""We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set, or any passerby. So, safety is everything"" ""We expect -- it's not much fun. ... We expect, and others expect, that perhaps the FAA, the CAA might say, ""You need to put someone in a suit that's not inflated"""
"The space suit is the only one of its kind in the world. It's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers. It weighs about 15 pounds. I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel, which means that I can practice everything I need to practice."
"Ice is the canary in the global coal mine. It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action. I'm confident that we'll find one. I think it's a great challenge. I hope that you will agree with me, it is the greatest stunt on Earth."
"Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world, he says. But in the arctic and alpine environments, where the ice is, it's real and it's present. The changes are happening. They're very visible, they're photographable and measurable."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at the effects of climate change on glaciers. He used 25 time-lapse cameras to capture the change over time. Defterio: ""There is no significant scientific dispute about that. It's been observed"""
"Cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers, and they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions. They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them. There is a custom made computer that tells the camera when to fire."
"The graph shows how temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync. The same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time. ""This is the story that counts. Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion,"" he says."
"The temperature of the Earth has gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius, in the past hundred years. We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability. The Extreme Ice Survey is dedicated to merging the art and science to the end."
"The Columbia glacier in Alaska is retreating, like air is being let out of a balloon. The retreat of the glacier since 1984 has been higher than the Eiffel Tower. The glacier is expected to retreat another half a mile in the coming weeks."
"The rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago. A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley. The images make the invisible visible."
The Sólheimajökull glacier is one of the world's most active glaciers. The glacier's terminus has been retreating in recent months. The retreat has been caused by a huge collapse of ice in the springtime this year.
"Greenland started reacting to the warming climate of the past century. The smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate. The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier."
"Lewis Hamilton traveled to the Arctic to document the effects of climate change. He recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film. Hamilton: The first thing we need to do is break this problem down into manageable chunks. ""When it comes to climate change, every single country is going to have to make cuts"""
"Climate change is a global problem, says UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The world has come a long way in a short period of time, he says. ""We need to believe in ourselves. Now is the time to believe,"" he adds."
"In the two years before my swim, 23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover just melted away. I wanted to shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening. The message was very clear: Climate change is for real, and we need to do something about it."
The swim took place in minus 1.7 degrees Celsius. The swimmer spent a year preparing for the event. He swam the North Pole hundreds of times in his mind to prepare for the conditions. He also trained with his late father to prepare him for the swim.
"I have never in my life felt anything like that moment. I could barely breathe. I was hyperventilating so much, and within seconds my hands were numb. I remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock, because my fingers had swollen so much."
"Ranulph Fiennes fell through the ice into the sea while trying to ski all the way to the North Pole. He was able to get himself out after just three minutes in the water. But when he tried to do a 20-minute swim, he couldn't feel his hands after five minutes."
"Lewis Hamilton is a British explorer and author. He visited the North Pole with a group of Arctic explorers. The expedition saw him swim in black water 4,200 meters deep. Hamilton: ""I had never seen black water before. I said to myself, ""Don't look left, don't look right"""
"CNN's John Defterios is in the middle of a three-day trip to the North Pole. He is working on a book about how to make the most of the time we have left on Earth. Defterio: ""I'm trying to find a way to make this world a better place for all people"""
"Scientists have discovered a brain region for thinking about other people's thoughts. The region is called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction. Some of the differences between people, in how we judge others, can be explained by differences in this brain system."
"""Ivan"" is a five-year-old boy who loves cheese sandwiches. He puts his sandwich on top of a pirate chest. The wind blows the sandwich off the chest and onto the grass. ""Ivan's"" friend, ""Joshua,"" is also a pirate and also loves cheese."
"Child: So he won't know which one is his. RS: That's exactly right. Child: And then his went on the ground. RNC: So that's a problem in philosophy, but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind."
"The author shows a three-year-old and a five- year-old arguing over who should get in trouble for taking a sandwich. The five-year old thinks it was mean of Ivan to take Joshua's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich. ""Why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes?"" the author asks."
"In children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ, being used while children are thinking about other people. But it's not quite like the adult brain. And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds, getting into early adolescence, they still don't have quite an adult-like brain region."
"A woman puts poison in her friend's coffee, and her friend drinks the coffee and is fine. People disagree about how much blame Grace should get in the accident case. Some people think she should deserve more blame, and other people less. ""We look inside the brains of people while they're making that judgment"""
"The RTPJ is a group of people who disagree about the role of religion in society. The group is trying to change people's moral judgments. To do this, they use a tool called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS. TMS temporarily disorganizes the function of neurons in a brain region."
"TMS can be used to change people's moral judgments, says Chris Anderson. People have a special brain system that lets them think about what other people are thinking, he says. Differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people."
"Research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new. Until recently, what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal's brain could do too. The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain, but they're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we make."
"The brain is made up of pieces, brain cells, that we share with all other animals. And we don't know yet what the implications will be of understanding the brain. ""It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing,"" he says."
"Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market, and so they buy it from the Internet. The parasite is beginning to develop a resistance. Organized crime is a major economic force and we need to take it very, very seriously."
"CNN's John Defterios looks back at some of the key figures in Eastern Europe's post-communist history. Defterio: ""Some of the people who had wielded power before 1989 continued to do so after the revolutions"" ""They used to get great apartments, casual sex on tap, and they could travel to the West very freely"""
CNN's John Defterios looks at the role of the mafia in the modern world. He says the mafia has played a key role in the collapse of the Soviet Union. The mafia has also played a major role in helping to build up the economy of the region.
"Organized crime operates in the same way as any other business. It has zones of production, like Afghanistan and Columbia, and zones of distribution, like Mexico and the Balkans. In the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP."
"CNN's John Defterios shows how the mafia makes money from illegal trade. He says the money is used to buy weapons and then sell them to the West. The money is then used to fund illegal trade in drugs and arms, he says. Defterio: ""It's a very lucrative business, but it's also a very dangerous business"""
"The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre, says the former head of Europol. In the 1990s, there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering, he says. The liberalization of international financial markets made it easy for the money launderers, he adds."
"The U.N. says Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs. The drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink, in my opinion. The market share of heroin and cocaine is going down."
"Brazilian cyber criminals have shifted their operations to avoid arrest. The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering. There's one born every minute in the world of cybercrime, says Mr Pringle. ""It's really not that difficult. It's actually much easier"""
"The island will be the first carbon-neutral island in Central Asia. The buildings will create shelter from the wind and accumulate solar energy. With a little luck and some more evolution, maybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars."
"The design process was tough, almost like a struggle for survival, but gradually an idea evolved: this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city, expanding the public space onto what we refer to as a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome."
"The project is based on a design for a building in the north of Sweden. It was inspired by the Chinese character for ""people"" The project is being shown at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week in China. It is the first time the project has been shown to the public in public."
"The theme of this year's World Economic Forum is ""Better City, Better Life"" China is one of the biggest countries in the world, but it is also one of its smallest. The theme of the forum is ""Sustainability in China"""
"Copenhagen and Shanghai are both port cities, but the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it. Bicycles have become forbidden many places in China, but in Copenhagen we're expanding the bicycle lanes. We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai."
"""The Little Mermaid"" is a series of short films about the life of the Little Mermaid. The series is based on the popular children's book of the same name. The Little Mermaid is the first of a series that will be shown on a regular basis."
"The Chinese government is considering moving the national monument in Denmark. The Mermaid will be moved to Shanghai from May to December next year. If the Chinese government intervenes, it might even be a panda. ""Yes is More"" is a comic book based on the ideas of some of the world's greatest artists."
"Mies van der Rohe triggered the modernist revolution. The apartments cover the parking structure and are accessed through a diagonal elevator. They form this sort of vertical backyard where, on a nice summer day, you'll get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of 10 meters."
"The Mountain is a 3,000 square meter artwork of Mount Everest. The facade of the parking was perforated to make it naturally ventilated. The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades. All the rainwater that drops on the Mountain is actually accumulated."
"""Yes is More"" is a film about the architectural avant-garde. The film was commissioned by the national bank of Iceland. The project aims to recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of Azerbaijan. The island is designed as a single ecosystem, exploiting wind energy and water."
"Gravity is the least understood of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest. Nobody really knows what it is or why it's there. And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape, gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green, lush landscape."
"I'm not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist. I have no idea what any of you are thinking. We can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough. But we can't read each other's minds."
"I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists, until somebody properly defines the terms. We can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter. Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Two more than people, and the same as a gorilla."
"Psychoanalysts can't see the past, except in your memory. The question is, who, then, are we? What is this thing that we hang on, that is actually us? Atoms, you can'tsee them."
"Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual. He also invented a word called ""blas,"" meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on, unfortunately."
"The biggest thing that's invisible to us is what we don't know, he says. We can see stars and the planets, but we can't see what holds them apart or what draws them together. The point, most of us. What's the point? It's by definition dimensionless."
"Ludwig Wittgenstein: ""I don't know why we are here. But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves"" W.H. Auden: ""We are here on earth to help others. What the others are here for, I've no idea"" Charles Bonnet: ""The theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain"""
"Oliver Sacks: I'm a little visually impaired myself. I'm blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other. And I see the geometrical hallucinations. But they stop there. Because you understand what's doing it, it doesn't make you worried."
"A 95-year-old woman has been hallucinating for the last few days. She says the hallucinations are unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing. The hallucinations seem to come on by themselves, or disappear, she says. She knew it was a hallucination, but she was frightened."
An old lady was suffering from hallucinations. She didn't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations. The people and the animals all seemed oblivious of her. She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind. But she was perfectly sane.
"Charles Bonnet's grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man. He'd had cataract surgery. His vision was pretty poor. He described to his grandson various things he was seeing. The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair."
"Psychiatrist: "" hallucinations are rather sudden, and they change suddenly"" ""They seem to come from the outside and to mimic perception,"" he says. ""They don't seem to be under control. They don't usually fade in and out"""
"With another patient of mine who also had some vision, the visions she had could be disturbing. A lot of them had to do with a car. She would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car. And, above all, she would see cartoons."
"A nursing home called to say a resident in her 90s was seeing things. The faces were often deformed, with very large teeth or very large eyes. Psychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal, address you in different ways. They accuse you, seduce you, humiliate you and jeer at you."
"Temporal lobe hallucinations are the most common form of hallucinations. They are caused by the activation of the brain's primary visual cortex. They can also be caused by a sense of time and place, such as when you are looking at a picture of a past time."
People with abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus may hallucinate faces. The gyrus is activated when people get deformed hallucinations. There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons. There are other parts of thebrain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes.
"Charles Bonnet syndrome is a rare but common condition that affects blind people and the visually impaired. Symptoms include hallucinations of faces, cars, people and objects. The syndrome is caused by an anarchic, convulsive stimulation of the brain's visual cortex."
"An NYU researcher took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them, and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination. It said, ""Can you help me get there?"" Released it on the streets of Manhattan. They'll fund anything these days."
"Jonathan Zittrain: The Internet has no business plan, never did. No CEO, no firm responsible, singly, for building it. Instead, it's folks getting together to do something for fun, rather than because they were told to."
"As late as 1992, IBM was known to say you couldn't possibly build a corporate network using Internet Protocol. Even some Internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out. So what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual? Well, to move data around from one place to another -- again, it's not like a package courier."
"In a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination. You need a lot of trust, but it's not like, ""I'm trying to get to Pensacola, please"" The Internet needs addressing and directions. It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet."
"The Internet suddenly awakened to find that it was YouTube. packets of data from subscribers going to YouTube stopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there. Within two minutes, it reverberates around and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world. Within about two hours, the problem was fixed."

"Photographs of wrongfully convicted men are used to create a fantasy. The men in these photographs, the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification. ""Photography's ability to blur truth and fiction, which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences"""
"Photographs can be used to help convict or exonerate a person. Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young girl walking to school. He served 18 years of a death sentence. Frederick Daye was photographed at his alibi location, where 13 witnesses placed him."
"I photographed at the scene of arrest, where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana, in this very room to hide from the police. I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction, in both his life and in photography. I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction."

"CNN's John Defterios meets Amitabha Sadangi, an entrepreneur who has been working with some of the poorest farmers on the planet. He says the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day. Defterio: Amitabh decided to take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves."
"As of today, Amitabha's organization has sold over 300,000 drip irrigation systems to farmers in India and Pakistan. In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with UNICEF to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people. 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to build an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth."
"President Obama recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in the U.S. and look at how we can scale it. The fund could use this time to invest not directly in government, but in existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders, he says."
"Pakistan's civil society is building alternatives to the Taliban. Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation are building schools across the country. Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce mobility in their very nature. President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable."
"When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity. At the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now. I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at the challenges facing the world's poorest people. He says we need to look beyond the Middle East and Africa to find solutions. Defterio: ""It will take embracing the world with both arms to make a difference"""
"In 1945 there were just 100 countries in the world. Today there are more than 200. The question is how do we change those borders, and what lines do we focus on? Then we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one."
"Do we live in a borderless world? You can see that Africa has been fragmented. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created. Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss? Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world."
"The World Bank predicts that Russia's population is declining towards about 120 million people. Only 30 million people are in its eastern areas. In Mongolia, Chinese firms operate and own most of the mines and truck the resources south and east into mainland China. In the Russian far east today, there are exactly six million Russians."
"In the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China, you have over 100 million people. That's larger than the entire population of Russia. Every single year, for at least a decade or more, [60,000] of them have been voting with their feet, moving north."
"East Asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world. Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region, so much of it being invested into China. China targets Japan and Korea and Australia, countries that are strong allies of the United States."
"China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region. It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the East Asian Community. China exports business people, nannies and teachers to teach Chinese around the region, to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies."
"In the Middle East, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal. What can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world? What lines on the map should we focus on? What is state building, day by day?"
"Kurdish oil is exported through Turkey, Syria, and Iraq itself. Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world, behind Saudi Arabia. The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone, without infrastructure, is futile. If Gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the West Bank, you have a viable Palestinian state."
"The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus. It even had an offshoot running to Haifa in what is today Israel. The last time that was the case was actually a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire. If we were to focus on these curvy lines on the map, that cross the borders, the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region."
"Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan are all looking to become part of the global oil and gas network. The more pipelines we have, the less of a Great Game we'll have in the 21st century, says David Frum."
"The European Union has grown by one country per year since the end of the Cold War. The E.U. also became a currency block, and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world. Even if these regions aren't part of the E.u., they are becoming part of its sphere of influence."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at the future of the Middle East. He says Turkey and the Caucasus have become the conduit for 20 percent of Europe's energy supply. South Central Asia, South West Asia is a very good place to start, he says."
Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed many great things in his career in the 19th century. He imagined an integrated transportation system in which a passenger could embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York. Brunel was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how design is being used to solve problems. Sutter: ""Design is about what humans need and how they can get it. It's not about how it looks, it's about what it can do"""
"Conversion Sound has developed a high quality, ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid for the developing world. In the West we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids. In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist. So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA might replace those technicians."
Lenses are being used to replace lenses that are damaged by the sun. They are now being used in a new way to make them more affordable. The idea is that they can be used to make people's lives better by making them more productive.
Designers have been working on a new way of working with patients. The idea is to reduce the time it takes to care for a patient. The project is being led by the London School of Economics and Social Sciences. It is the first of its kind in the UK and aims to be a national model.
We need to change our way of thinking. We need a new way of looking at the world. It's time to rethink how we see the world and how we want to live in it. And we need to do it in a way that makes sense to us.
"CNN's John Defterios is working on a series of stories about design. He wants to hear from the public about what they think design can do for the world. He has set up a Twitter account, #CBD, where people can post their ideas for design."
"TED Talk: The Golden Rule is the source of all morality. The task of our time is to build a global society where people can live together in peace. If we don't implement the Golden Rule globally, I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation."
"""We have to make this happen, and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced,"" he says. Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions, he adds. ""I intend to work on this till my dying day. And I want to continue with our partners to educate and stimulate compassionate thinking"""
"""Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you,"" says C.S. Lewis. ""Look into your own heart, discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse, under any circumstance, to inflict that pain on anybody else"""
"""We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends"" ""We learn to live together and to get to know one another"" ""People have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works"""
"The power of spectroscopy was actually realized by Pink Floyd already in 1973. The number one high resolution, most precise spectrograph on this planet is called HARPS. HARPS is actually used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars."
"The spectrum of the Sun has 24,000 spectral lines. About 15 percent of these lines are not yet identified. Astronomers can study line-of-sight velocities of cosmic objects. They can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars, galaxies, nebulae."
"Osmium is a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae. It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium. We use this weak feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun."
"Spectroscopy can probably answer the question, ""Is there anybody out there?"" There is interaction of galaxies. And sometimes they just capture stars. They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy."
The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets. The precision which we need to discover a Jupiter-like planet around a sun-like star is something like 28.4 meters per second. We need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth- like planet.
"Scientists are trying to detect life in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet. If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium, there would be no life on the planet. ""It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature. We are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium"""
"Water, methane, carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system. The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge, is a detection of vegetated area. The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals."
"SETI is a project to find alien life on another planet. The project has been going since 2000 and is reviewing the spectra of about 300 stars with extrasolar planets. If you see strange chemical elements in the spectrum of a planet host star, it can be a signal from a civilization."
"In about five years we will discover planets like Earth, around sun-like stars, the same distance as the Earth from the Sun. And then we will need another 10, 15 years with space projects to get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you."
"Every seven years, I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments, things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year. The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali. I am not a religious person myself, but I did look for nature."
The artist created a series of 99 portraits of dogs on tee shirts. The images were inspired by the wild dogs that surround his home in Bali. The shirts come with a menacing message on the back of the shirt. The artist is currently in the process of renovating his studio in the island.
CNN's John Defterios shows off some of the things he's done while on sabbatical. He also shows off a coffee table that includes 330 compasses and custom-made espresso cups with a magnet inside. He says he also started meditating for the first time in his life in Bali and made peace with his dogs.
"Fry: ""I've found that finding out about what I'm going to like in the future, my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it"" Fry: ""If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical, it's 12.5 percent of my time"""
"In the beginning, on the first sabbatical, it was rather disastrous. I had thought that I should do this without any plan, that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation. I just reacted to little requests, not work requests, those I all said no to, but other little requests."
"Casa da Musica, the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto, in Portugal, is the subject of a new identity. The logo was created using software that can be used to create any image, including a Beethoven image."
"Casa da Musica is home to a full-blown orchestra and a smaller contemporary orchestra. Philip Glass, Lou Reed and the Chemical Brothers all have their own Casa Da Musica logo. You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house, or a rave underneath."
"With the help of 100 volunteers, over a week, created this fairly floral typography that spelled, ""Obsessions make my life worse and my work better"" The city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something. We got 250,000 coins from the central bank, at different darknesses."
"The artwork was created by a group of volunteers in Amsterdam. When the artwork was complete, the police were called in to collect it. The project is part of a larger project to make a film about happiness in Bali. The film is due to be released in 2015."
"By 2050, twice the number of us are going to be living in cities. Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away. Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land. It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West."
"A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve. 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations. So how did we get here? And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?"
"Every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of. The whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them."
"The streets and public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold. Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast. Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food."
"Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process. It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all."
"Food used to be a social event, buying and selling food. Now it's anonymous. We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something. We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat."
"Food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia, says philosopher. Utopian was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately. It can either mean a good place, or no place, he says. We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool."
"Food is at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it. But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this. It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan. We need these people."
"Sitopia is a project that aims to reconnect people with nature. It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives. The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago. Ambrogio Lorenzetti's ""Allegory of Good Government"" is about relationship between city and countryside."
"""We need to realize that the world is also what we eat,"" says CNN's John Sutter. ""It's within these tribes that societies get built, that important things happen,"" he says. Sutter: ""What we're really here to talk about is the how."""
"People form tribes. They always have, they always will. Not all tribes are the same, and what makes the difference is the culture. You're all a member of tribes. If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward, along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the culture of Stage One. Stage One produces people who do horrible things, Sutter says. Sutter: It's not enough to simply write people off. He says we need to move on to Stage Two."
"""How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"" ""I'm saying the culture makes people dumb,"" he says. ""You find them in all places in society"" ""I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class"""
"CNN's John Sutter reports on a meeting of doctors in an elevator. Sutter: One doctor said, ""I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else"" Another doctor replied, ""That's great. I'm off running the future of medicine"" Sutter says it's a sign of a ""tribal"" meeting."
The company is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four. The company is based outside Las Vegas. The CEO says the company is looking for ways to improve its business. He says they are looking for new ways to make their business more profitable.
"Desmond Tutu set up a process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together. No one had ever done anything like this before. People, at the time, feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone."
"The Declaration of Independence is written at Stage Two, the author says. The phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights, he says. ""Life is great"" is oriented only by our values, no other guidance, he adds."
"Two percent of people are at Stage One, 25 percent at Stage Two. Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three. Only two percent, only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five. And those are the ones that change the world."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how people can move from Stage One to Stage Four. Sutter: ""If you want this experience to live on as something historic, then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do"""
Nigerian author Femi Ogunlesi says he wants to change the way people think about the world. He says he has started a non-profit called the Farafina Trust to help people in need. He also wants to use his own experience to help young people in Nigeria.
"CNN's John Sutter writes about the power of stories. He says stories can be used to make people feel better about their lives. Sutter: ""There is never a single story about any place that doesn't have a story"" The author also writes about his love of African culture."
"Nigerian author Yinka Ogunlesi grew up in a middle-class family in eastern Nigeria. He says he was shocked when he saw a basket made by a member of his family. Ogunlezu: ""I didn't know that people like me could exist in literature"""
"Nigeria's former president, Goodluck Jonathan, has written a book about his time in the U.S. Jonathan says he was shocked by his American roommate's reaction to him. She felt sorry for him, he says, because he was not like her. He says he has come to embrace his African identity."
"Nigeria's former president, Goodluck Jonathan, has written a book about his time in Africa. Jonathan's book is called ""Africa: A Love Story"" The book is based on the account of a London merchant called John Lok, who sailed to west Africa in 1561. Lok described black Africans as ""beasts who have no houses"""
"CNN's John Defterios writes about his experience of living in the U.S. He says he was shocked to find out that the majority of Americans don't know their history. Defterio: ""It is impossible to talk about power without talking about the power of the people"""
"Nigerian-born writer had a happy childhood, full of laughter and love, in a close-knit family. But he also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps. ""I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me,"" he says."
"As a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table, margarine disappeared, then bread became too expensive, then milk became rationed. I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education, so that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries. I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories."
"Nigerian writer, Femi Ogunlesi, has written a book about his time in Lagos. He says he was inspired by a woman who told him to write a sequel to his first novel. Oganlesi: ""What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music, film and literature?"""
"Nigeria's President, Goodluck Jonathan, says context is everything. Context tells us not only why we see what we do, but who we are as individuals, he says. ""What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider?"" he asks."
"The light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world, not only the color of objects. The same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources. The light that fall onto your eye is meaningless, because it could mean literally anything."
"The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns, finding relationships in information, and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning, a significance. It's what we do with that information that matters. The brain can redefine normality, even at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color."
"The right side of the brain's visual field is under red illumination; the left side is under green. One is simply the flipping of the other. The brain is seeing that same information as if the right one was still under red light, and the left one was under green light."
"An illusion of light and dark surrounds is based on what your behavior has been in the past. The illusion is created when two identical tiles are placed in a dark and a light surround. If they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye, then they must be equally reflective."
"phthalmologist: The physical reality is that those two tiles are the same. What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion, he says. The four blue tiles on the left are gray. The seven yellow tiles are also gray. And how many people think it's the orange one?"
"Even the beautiful bumblebee, with its mere one million brain cells, sees illusions, says scientist. Even our most sophisticated computers can't do the most complicated things, he says. In my lab we work on bumblebees, because we can completely control their experience, and see how it alters their brain."
"The bees go back and forth between this hive and the arena, via this tube. They land on the flower, stick their tongue in there, called a proboscis, and drink sugar water. They learn not to go to the blue, but to go where the other bees go."
The brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past. How we see is by continually redefining normality. One of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound. And they can navigate the world using their ears.
"Working with kids, they created images, thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them. And then we translated these images. And this is one of those images. It's a six-year-old child composing a piece of music for a 32-piece orchestra."
"phthalmologist: ""No one is an outside observer of nature"" ""We're not defined by our central properties, by the bits that make us up"" ""I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding of the world,"" he says. ""I want to celebrate uncertainty"""
"phthalmologist John Sutter takes a look at manspaces. Sutter: ""The question is, ""Is that an illusion?"" The light coming through those middle nine on the right, or your left, is the same as the light coming out of the middle nine in the middle of the left."
"On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage. On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house. The man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style."
"The space is made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship. It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s. It was built by a man who is Wayne McCullough, who won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics."
"When Wren was born, he realized he needed to find a space of his own. He built a garage in his backyard. He traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos. But every time he would return from his trips he'd return back to New York City."
"CNN's John Sutter explores the geography and history of New York City. Sutter: ""I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall, and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them"" ""I started seeing paintings like this,"" Sutter says."
"The map is from the American Revolution, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City. It's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide. If you zoom in to lower Manhattan, you can see the extent of the city as it was at the end of the Revolution."
"CNN's John Sutter has created a digital map of the New York City area. He says the map can be used to show how the city has changed since the 1800s. Sutter: ""If we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time"""
"Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does, than Yellowstone, than Amboseli. It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity. So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees, the 85 different kinds of fish."
"Beavers need a slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows, near the water. An aspen needs fire and dry soils. A wet meadow needs beavers to create the wetlands, and maybe some other things. A bog turtle needs wet meadows and insects."
"John Muir created the Muir Web to show the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan. John Muir: ""When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe"""
"The map was created using the same technology used in Hollywood. The map shows the landscape of New York City as it would have looked 400 years ago. It also shows how the city has changed over the years, including the development of the East River."
"CNN's John Defterios is a journalist and author. He is best known for his work on the history of the U.S. Air Force. Defterio: ""I think we're in a time when we need to rethink how we look at the world"""
"Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals. This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world."
"David Hanson: Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy. Hanson: If they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future. ""You start to believe that it's alive and aware,"" Hanson says."
"Chris Anderson is working on a character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence. The robot can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech and model how you're feeling and who you are."
"CNN's John Defterios speaks at the TED conference in London. He says most problems are problems of perception, not reality. He suggests that placebos could be used to solve problems. Defterio: 'How many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception'"
"Fredrick the Great of Prussia was keen for Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it. He realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate, wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread. Prussian peasantry said, ""We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things"""
"Ataturk was keen to discourage the wearing of a veil, in Turkey, to modernize it. He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil. Ataturk realized that all value is relative, and persuasion is often better than compulsion."
"In Italy, penalty points go backwards. You start with 12 and they take them away. Because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people's behavior. The highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds."
"Adam Smith talks about 18th century America, where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great, it was almost a block in the economy in New England. It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies, he says."
"In the digital world, ""user-generated content"" is called a mash-up. In the world of food we call it cooking. Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich. He actually invented the toasty."
"Marketing has done a very, very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying. Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving. It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions, and the very nature of the decisions changes."
"Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal, only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain. It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown. Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example of intangible value creation."
"Rory Sutherland: We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists, and less time agonizing over what else we can do. Sutherland: There is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine, except when you tell the people how expensive it is."
" cognitive scientist says the brain creates, builds, a version of the universe, and projects it all around us like a bubble. The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers. When you place a value on things like health, love, sex and other things, and learn to place a material value on them, you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined."
"Scientists are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain. 99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes, but what you infer about that room. It took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain, so it had to improve it a little bit."
"From mouse to man, the neocortex expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons. The neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed. It's made up of little modules, G5 processors, like in a computer. But there are about a million of them."
"There is a new theory of autism called the ""intense world"" Theory suggests that the neocortical columns are super-plastic. They are highly reactive, and so the autists are probably capable of building a symphony. The perception, the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted."
"The most important design secret of the brain is diversity, says Dr. David Wheeler. Every neuron is different. It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different, and in the brain it is the same, he says. Wheeler: We have to embody all our data and knowledge into a working model."
"Scientists have discovered that the circuitry of the brain does change. But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not. The equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates. And we think this is species-specific, which could explain why we can't communicate across species."
"The Blue Gene is a supercomputer that simulates the activity of the brain's neocortex. It is the first time scientists have been able to simulate brain activity using just a handful of equations. The computer is the size of 10,000 laptops and can simulate the brain in its entirety."
Scientists have trained a brain to see itself by stimulating its neocortical column. The next step is to project these brain coordinates into perceptual space. Scientists hope to create a hologram of the brain within 10 years. They hope to use this hologram to help diagnose and treat disorders.
"The brain has a very small amount of bandwidth for processing sound, says Dr. David Wheeler. Wheeler: ""You can't understand two people talking at once. You have to choose which one you're going to listen to"" He says if you work in an open-plan office, the noise level is three times higher."
"Most sound is accidental, even hostile, and it has a dramatic effect on sales. Music is the most powerful sound there is, often inappropriately deployed. We stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this, pretending it doesn't exist. Or start at the bottom and say what outcomes we want."
"Music is very powerful, and unfortunately, it's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately. Every brand is out there making sound right now. There are eight expressions of a brand in sound; they're all important. Make it congruent, pointing in the same direction as your visual communication. That increases impact by over 1,100 percent."
"The habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious. There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time, and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness. I recommend at least five minutes a day, but there's no maximum dose. I'll leave you with more birdsong."
"Music is the most powerful form of sound that affects our emotional state. Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring. We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, health care -- all these issues facing us."
"Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years. The personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years. However, consumers have moved. They are taking responsibility."
"11 straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the financial crisis. In the fourth quarter, credit card spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years. ""We're starting to be much more careful about how we save and invest"""
"VML and Young &amp; Rubicam look at what's driving new consumer behaviors. The first cultural value shift we see is this tendency toward something we call ""liquid life"" By restricting their demand, consumers can align their values with their spending, says VML."
"Déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion. The less excess that you have around you, the more nimble and fleet of foot you are. We see high-end haggling in fashion today, high- end haggle for luxury and real estate."
"Frito-Lay and the San Francisco Giants have instituted dynamic pricing. Consumers are demanding value and fair play from businesses. Consumers represent 72 percent of the GDP of the U.S., says David Frum. The consumer is demanding it, Frum says."
"The recession has led to a rise in volunteerism in the U.S. The recession has also led to an increase in ""boomerang"" alumni. Microsoft is vowing to retrain two million Americans with IT training. GORE-TEX is all about personal accountability."
"Americans are digging in and looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase they make. 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card, the highest percentage ever in our nation's history. 30 percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners."
"Cooperative consumerism is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace. The artisanal movement is huge: everything about locally derived products and services. The fourth post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about ""return to the fold"""
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the rise and fall of local currencies. Sutter: ""You have to realize that you can't control this. You need to harness it. And there's really interesting examples here"" He also looks at cow-pooling, where consumers pool their resources to do good."
"Zagat's has moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants, into actually rating health care. The Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin. You see this rising force in total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt, because the consumer is demanding it."
Photographs of the human face can be used to create digital images of the skin. Photographers can use the light reflected from the skin to create a digital image of the face. The images can then be used in other ways to create more realistic images of humans.
"The human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions. We used this data to create a rigged, digital version of Emily. The company Image Metrics created a digital puppet of her, where you can pull on these various strings."
"Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company. It specializes in high-quality facial animation for video games and films. The group is now looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies. They have created a completely photo-real digital face of Bruce Willis."
"Computer-generated face of actress Emily O'Brien created by Lenny Bernstein and his company, Image Metrics. The image was created using 156 white LEDs in a controlled lighting environment. The video projector patterns drape over the contours of her face, and different principle directions of light from the light stage."
"The meaning of the music is pain, he says. And you look at Lenny and he's suffering. But not in a way that you want to stop. It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say. But you can see the music on his face."
The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. The orchestra has been performing in Vienna since the 1970s. It is the first time in the history of the orchestra that the orchestra has played in front of a live audience.
"""The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time"" ""You have the story of the audience as a community. And then you have other stories, unseen. People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments. This is the true experience of a live concert"""
"Riccardo Muti is a great conductor, but not all conductors do just that. He's so commanding. Maybe a little bit over-clear. Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni? You have to sing ""Aaaaaah,"" and I'll stop you."
"Riccardo Muti is known for using a finger to stop an orchestra. Muti says he is responsible for Mozart, which is like a third seat from the center. Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala saying, ""You're a great conductor"""
"Richard Strauss wrote what he called ""The Ten Commandments for Conductors"" The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong. The fourth one says: Never look at the trombones -- it only encourages them."

"In India alone, 62 percent of all injections given are unsafe. In Indonesia, there is usually a toy seller in the playground. In China, recycling and reuse are the major issues. In Pakistan, not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped in half an hour."
"The syringe is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license. You give the injection and then put it down. If someone then tries to reuse it, it locks and breaks afterwards. In comparison, a Coca-Cola is 10 times the price of a syringe."
Malaria kills approximately one million people a year. The reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills 1.3 million people. A young girl and her friend that I met in an orphanage in Delhi were HIV positive from a syringe.
"The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable. Invisible capacity in our bodies, in our brains, and in the air will continue. I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030, because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body."
"Technology is changing the way we live and work, says Lord Tebbit. He says there is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in 2030. The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in China."

"Globalization is getting more complex and rapid. The future will be more unpredictable. Urbanization, integration, coming together, leads to a new renaissance. It took from the Stone Age to achieve that. We can create miracles, collectively, in our lifetime."
"Globalization is a huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential for innovation, for development. But there is an underbelly. Globalization has not been inclusive. The second Achilles' heel is complexity -- a growing fragility, a growing brittleness."
"Before the scientific revolution, people believed all they knew was what was known. The discovery of the universe was a revolution in how people sought knowledge. The question is, what made the difference between knowledge and discovery? And what was the difference in the first place?"
"At the time, what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen, known as empiricism. It did help by promoting observation and experiment. But, from the outset, it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it. And that rarely, if ever, caused anything like the scientific revolution."
"The evidence for evolution is some rocks and some finches, he says. The eye only detects light, which we don't perceive as light, he adds. Brains only detect nerve impulses, he argues. So we perceive nothing as what it really is."
"Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything. Like all knowledge, it's conjectural, guesswork, tested by observation, not derived from it. The ancient Greeks wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing, and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation."
There is such a thing as a bad explanation of a story. The reason for Persephone's return is the same as the reason for the Earth's tilt. The only difference is that the story doesn't have to be explained in such a way.
The ancient Greeks could have easily varied their myth to predict that seasons in Australia were out of phase. The search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress. It's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable.
"CNN's John Sutter talks with chemist Martin Hanczyc about the transition from inert to living matter. He says that the truth consists of hard-to-vary assertions about reality. Sutter: ""That the truth is a fact that is itself unseen, yet impossible to vary"""
"Top-down methods of building buildings have been used in architecture since ancient times. The new project aims to create bottom-up construction approaches for architecture. This involves blueprints, industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers. The project is being led by the University of Oxford's Department of Architecture."
"Architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show how it may be possible to grow a limestone reef underneath the city of Venice. Kerrigan: ""We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals. We're looking at crystal lattices"""
"The technology will be tested on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice. As the buildings are repaired, we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city. It will attract the local marine ecology, who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture."
"The only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature, not insulating them from it. Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world, through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism. This is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way."

"The number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube has 25 digits. ""It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject,"" he says. ""In everything, uniformity is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth"""
"Symmetry is almost nature's language. It helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world. Symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object."
"The power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us. Artists too love to play around with symmetry. Even when building the Imperial Palace, they always leave one place unfinished. A peasant was found writhing in agony on the floor, clearly shot by a dueling wound."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at some of the symmetry in the world of art. He asks: What does it mean to be symmetrical? And how does it work? Defterio: ""I think it's a way of looking at things in a new way"""
"The power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language. So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here. What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same? Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started."
"Galois: Everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is. The invention of the number zero was a modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians. Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother."
"Galois: How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have? How many things can I do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube? And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end. The last words he said to his brother were, ""Don't cry for me, Alfred"""
"Galois: The symmetries of the triangle are completely different to those of the circle. Galois: It's not revolutionary politics for which Galois was famous. The triangle and the circle both have six symmetrie, so why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetry?"
"Galois developed the theory of symmetries in the 17th century. He said there are only two objects in the world with six symmetry. The idea of number was developed for symmetry, he says. Galois: ""It's almost like little Sudoku tables"""
"Galois' language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object, which we call 4-4-2. There are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn. This is how he wrote most of his mathematics."
"Using Galois' language, there are only 17 different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra. And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one, it will have to have the same symmetry as one of these 17. The night before that duel, he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough."
"In order to win this symmetrical object, what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning. How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have? If you all stay down he wins it automatically."
"Rabbi: ""We are made in the image of God, so we too have to be compassionate"" ""I know some people who say ""Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything, I'm not going to even begin to try"""
"Part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick. God thought that when God created the world, he would create the world only with the divine attribute of justice. But God realized that if the world were just filled with compassion, there would be anarchy and chaos."
"""We are made in the image of God,"" says the author. ""There is a unity that underlies all that we see and feel"" ""We have to do good things, but not at the expense of our own sanity,"" he says. ""That is the challenge of our time"""
"In Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters, stands for life -- the word ""life"" The rabbis say that at Passover, what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air. And that too is a basis for having compassion, for understanding our place in the world."
"A man heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up. He made 12 loaves of bread, took them to the synagogue, opened the ark and said, ""God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are"" Then he went home. The cleaner came into the synagogue. He says, "" God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread"""

"""To be compassionate is not a joke. After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate? With these words, thank you very much,"" he says. ""You can be compassionate occasionally, more moved by empathy than by compassion. Thank God we are empathetic"""
"No culture, no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy. The capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out and make a difference. There's no Indian compassion, there's no American compassion. No human heart is denied of that empathy. It can be anybody's game."
"Love is not an action, but in the English language, it is also an action. The subject -- ""me"" -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness. In spite of a very tragic life, one is happy in moments which are very few and far between."
"In spite of all limitations, you are the whole, he says. The wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. It is love first. You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless."
"When you relate to the world, the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is, what we say, love. Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing. To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate. There is no verb for compassion, but you have an adverb for compassion."

"At 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up, I learned something about compassion. My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter, Mother Williamson and Mother Lathers. They were old and infirm, and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything. They would offer sweets or money."
"Growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together. We are sisters and brothers united together. And, like Chief Seattle said, ""We did not spin the web of life. We're all strands in it"""

Einstein: Saint Asanga was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine. He was discontented with the state of people's practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time. He meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.
Maitreya saw a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge. The bird had cut a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds. The dog's hindquarters are a complete open sore. Some of it is like gangrenous and there are maggots in the flesh.
"Maitreya thought he could clean the dog's wounds and then spit out the maggots. He cut a piece of flesh from his thigh and placed it on the ground. The dog was already dead, so he put his tongue on the flesh to try to get rid of it. The smell and the smell was so disgusting."
"Buddha Asanga was chased out of Chautauqua by a mob who said he was the future Buddha. But a charwoman in the charnel ground saw a jeweled foot on his shoulder and then the dog. She encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya, who took him to a certain heaven."
"Einstein's insight is close to that of Buddhist psychology, wherein compassion is defined as ""the sensitivity to another's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering"" In the Buddhist view, in some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I, have been my mother."
"The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings, in spiritual traditions. The mother's compassion is the most powerful form of altruism. ""We see the mother in every being. And we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings,"" she says."
" Meditation pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy, which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly. You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness."
"""Lovely love"" is the first step to compassion, the next is ""universal compassion"" ""Universal compassion"" opposes self-centeredness and selfishness to compassion. Those caught in the cycle of self-concern suffer helplessly. The compassionate are more free and, implicitly, more happy."
"Dalai Lama: ""Kindness"" means ""universal responsibility"" ""Universal responsibility"" means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us. We should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it."
"In the human evolutionary lineage, even before there were homo sapiens, feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool. Biologists call that ""reciprocal altruism"" The basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor."
"CNN's Jim Boulden says it's good to have a sense of compassion for others. He says it is natural for people to want to help others in need. But, he says, it's also good to make sure that people are treated with respect."
"In everyday life, we all make decisions about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to. We have the capacity to carve out exceptions, put people in a special category. We all do that, and you see it all over the world. It's these exclusions to theGolden Rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble."
"CNN's John Sutter explains the difference between zero-sum and non-zero-sum games. Sutter: ""I think it's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths"""
"In a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game. The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non- zero-sum channels. In the modern world, the term ""interdependence"" is just another term for non- Zero-Sumness."
"CNN's John Sutter argues that compassion and the golden rule are built into human nature. Sutter: If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody, then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them. He says there's evidence that this kind of connection can expand the moral compass."
"Politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships, he says. Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on, in this regard. ""Expanding the moral imagination"" is not the same as compassion, but it's conducive to compassion."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to religious leaders about the role of compassion in society. Sutter: ""Compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature"" ""It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed,"" Sutter says."
"Some sociologists feel that Skype is a closure, it's a cocooning, that we're disengaging from the public.

"Anthropologist Danny Miller is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines. He says the mothers are engaged with their children through Skype. Miller: ""This has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children to be capable to do this cleavage"""
"Until the industrial revolution, people had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work. The lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out, the more removed he would be from his personal sphere. Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas."
"In the U.S. 75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones. The point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions. Behind issues of security and safety is that these institutions are trying to decide who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention."
"Thousands of workers are abandoned after the collapse of the construction industry. The question is, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, are you complicit in the human rights violations? ""Let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse"""

Scientists use supercomputers to calculate the chemistry of one molecule. They also fly all over the world looking for this thing. The scientists must be completely harnessed in order to make measurements. They have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements.
"The IPCC report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.

"Her father the king said, ""Don't whistle."" But the princess continued whistling. The king had an idea. He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter. Some whistled badly. Others whistled well. But the king won the battle."
The king and queen of India were told they could not defeat a woman. The princess decided to ask the men if they had defeated her. She asked them if they accepted that she had defeated them. The men were shocked and said they had never seen a woman defeat a man.

"The first treatise on the astrolabe, the first technical manual in the English language, was written by Geoffrey Chaucer in 1391. The central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection. The idea is that Earth is at the center of the universe, and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere."
"The North Star corresponds to the center of the device. The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets correspond to an offset circle. Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole, onto a flat surface."
"This is a rule device. And on the back are some other devices, measuring tools and scales, to be able to make some calculations. And in the back you can see a spider web pattern. And that web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky."
"With an iPod or an iPhone, you can tell exactly what the time is, with precision. The way little Lewis would tell the time was by a picture of the sky. The device uses a scale, a star, and a date line to show the time."
The concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 B.C. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it. It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types. The astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms.
"The first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket. An astrolabe reminds us just how resourceful people were, our forebears were, years and years ago. Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky is the real answer to knowing what time it is."
"In the 13th century, an astrolabe was the gadget of the day. It was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky. An educated child would know how to not only use it, but also how to make one."
"In 1858, Queen Victoria was able, for the first time, to communicate with President Buchanan, through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable. To grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. -- that's a piece of cake, with one billion people."
"In 1858, India, China, Japan and the U.S. had to sign the Harris Treaty. The treaty allowed foreigners to trade freely in China. But, Japan, in contrast to India and China, maintained its national sovereignty. The size of the bubble here is the population. On that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people."
"India and China's income per person used to be above that of Europe. But by 1850, India had been de-industrialized. The countries who were growing their economy were the United States and United Kingdom. Japan is trying to move up there."
"In 1947 India finally gained its independence. In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China in a way which surprised the world. In the 1930's now, you can see that Japan is going to a period of war, with lower life expectancy. But they did recover quite fast afterwards."

"Shanghai, one of the poorest inland provinces of China, is there. Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here, is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India. Kerala is flying on top there, matching United States in health, but not in economy."
"Income per person on this axis instead, poor down here, rich up there. But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast. You can see that in health and education. But in Africa, and other parts, there is still people with low health and very low economy."
"Growth is faster, and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in 2014. The question is, ""When will the catch up take place?"" Look at, look at the United States. Can you see the bubble? The dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there."
"Inequalities in China and India are the big obstacle to growth, he says. Social investments in health, education and infrastructure, and electricity is really what is needed in India and China, he adds. India and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change, he warns."
"I'm really worried about war. Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy, and a shift of power back to Asia? And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world? So, always avoid war, because that always pushes human beings backward."
"For every four barrels of oil that we consume, we only discover one. In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in. There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world. But of those, 65 have already passed their peak."
"Climate change is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about, says climate scientist. If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms, it would offset all the savings that we need to make, in carbon."
"The idea that technology can solve all our problems is a myth. We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse. We have to rely on what we already have, such as the use of fossil fuels, to power our homes."
"Transition is about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face, and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need. Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here, what they're doing looks very different in every place."
"The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology. It's really about how systems, settlements, withstand shock from the outside. And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said. Looking through the lens of resilience, we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable."
"There are now over 200 formal transition projects. Thousands of others are at what we call the mulling stage. They are mulling whether they're going to take it further. Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects. Promoting recycling, things like garden-share."
"Transition is the idea of developing a plan B for the future of a community. The idea is to create an economy that is more sustainable and productive. Transition has become something that has virally swept around the world. The Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, is one example."
"""We have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward from here,"" he says. ""I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil. But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward"""
Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces. Some are already deserts; others are being seriously degraded by the sand. The Sahel is the region most closely associated with desertification. It was here in the late '60s and early '70s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid.
"The Sahara is eating up almost two meters a day of the arable land, pushing people away from their homes. They had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it. If you happen to live close to the desert border, you can calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away."
"Trees or cacti are good for this. But, one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood. This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things. It adds roughness to the dune's surface. It creates physical spaces, habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes."
Bacillus pasteurii is a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes. It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it. The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours.
"Bacillus pasteurii can be used to create habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes. The bacteria can be spread into the sand and solidified into sandstone. The sand can then be greened using permacultural strategies. The result is a sandstone wall, stretching across the desert."
"The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century. This could prove disastrous in a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands. Some people believe this would spread uncontrollably, and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way."
"One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second. Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale, into a sand dune. As Borges would have it, it's the sand that turns into stone."
"Britain's relationship with the rest of the world is at an all-time high, says David Cameron. He says the world has changed fundamentally, and the problems we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone. But he adds that Britain's long-term interests need to be protected."
"Chris Anderson: America and Africa have a common interest in tackling climate change. Anderson: It is enlightened self-interest for us to work with other countries. The danger of Al Qaeda and related groups making progress in Africa is very big, he says."

"Every religion, every faith, has this global ethic at the center of its credo. The same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions. After the Second World War, we built institutions, the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank. But they are now out of date."
"Britain has a responsibility to protect, says Foreign Secretary William Hague. Hague: ""I believe the life of every human on the planet is worth the same, equal consideration"" The idea of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents."
"The responsibility to protect is a new idea that is, in a sense, taken over from the idea of self-determination as the principle governing the international community. We're saying that you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country; you've got to involve all countries. We've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work."
"President Obama has signed a bill into law to tackle climate change. The bill must now be approved by the UN Security Council, which has a vote on the issue. The UN says the world's poorest people need help to adapt to a low-carbon economy."
"Prime Minister: Black holes have no finite size, but there is a finite size that you can see. The Schwarzschild radius is named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius. Prime Minister: Any object can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it."
Gravity wins over all other known forces. The object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object. And then it's a black hole. The size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius. Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life. A supermassive black hole has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun. Black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.
"Researchers are trying to find out if there is a ""supermassive"" black hole at the center of our galaxy. The black hole is where most of the starlight comes out from, but it's more energetic than we think. It's given rise to the notion that all galaxies might harbor supermassive black holes at their centers."
"If there is a supermassive black hole, what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet. This is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei. The best place to look for these stealth black holes is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way."
"The Keck observatory is the world's largest telescope. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court. It's difficult to see astronomical sources, because of the atmosphere that's continuously moving by."
"Astronomer: If you can improve your life by a factor of 20, you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot. Adaptive optics works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that's continuously changing. Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible, take 500 years."
"Scientists have confined four million times the mass of the sun inside a circle. The size of the circle is 10,000 times smaller than the size of our solar system. The experiment is the best evidence for existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy."
Supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. Black hole strips gas cloud apart. Old stars should be very clustered around the black hole. Young stars should not be there. A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.
"Scientists are trying to figure out why there are so many young stars and so few old stars. The old ones are red. The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet. To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away."
"Supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy is a very simple object. But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe. It represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe. We hope to be able to test some of Einstein's theories of general relativity."
"CNN's John Defterios goes to the desert to see how they harvest rain in California. The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field and a big raised platform. They collect 100,000 liters of water in one season."
"The Jaigarh Fort can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals. The age of the fort is 400 years. It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon."
"The project is a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas. Water from 300, 400 kilometers away, soon it become like this. The water level -- these are not empty canisters -- water level is right up to this level."
"The town of Jaisalmer was established 800 years ago. It receives the least rainfall in the country, lowest rainfall. The town was the terminal point for silk route through Europe. It is located in the heart of the Golden Desert, which is home to wildlife."
"Every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms. Such a limited rainfall, and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. Estate, public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body. The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters."
"The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up. In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up. It was designed some 150 years ago. But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009, there will be a TED green and blue session."
"This year they have received only six centimeters of rainfall. The secret is ""[unclear],"" respect. Your own thing, not personal property, my property, every time. Don't spit, don't do anything wrong, so that the clean water can be collected."
"The first engineering college was created in a small village, not in the town. There were no English medium schools at that time, even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools. But such people, compelled to the East India Company, came here for business, a very dirty kind of business."

"Aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of Dr. V. TR: When you grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are healing."
"Aravind is a network of five hospitals in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Each year, the hospital performs about 300,000 surgeries. The majority of the surgeries are for the poor. The hospital was set up by Dr. Venkataswamy in the 1970s."
"The Aravind Eye Care System aims to deliver eye care in the same way across the world. The inspiration for the system came from McDonald's, says Dr. V. The eye problem is the same, as American or African, the problem is same, the treatment is same."
"Thulasiraj Ravilla: ""We looked at, are we solving the problem? We found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need"" ""We had to do something different, so we set up what we call primary eye care centers,"" he says. ""The effect of this has been that, within the first year, we really had a 40 percent penetration"""
"Village girls are the backbone of the organization. They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks. With the result we have very high productivity, very high quality at very, very low cost. A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions."
"Aravind: We created competition for ourselves, and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables. We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world. The impact of this has been that these hospitals are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well."
"In conditions where the problem is very large, where we have a good solution, I think the process I described, you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care, can give an answer. Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them. There are many where this paradigm can now play, but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side."
"""The 99"" is the world's first Islamic superheroes, created by a Kuwaiti psychologist. The characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah: justice, wisdom, mercy, among others. The likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with 'The 99' to beat injustice."
"Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern. The Quran encourages us to do this: ""We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another"" In the Arab world, people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them."
"The Red Brigades' turnover in the 1970s was seven million dollars a year. The group was short of cash and constantly searching for cash. The Red Brigade's life was not ruled by politics or ideology, but by economics. The only way to unblock what was known as a blocked democracy, Italy, was the arms struggle."
"The leader of the Red Brigades, Mario Moretti, was a keen sailor. He used to sail back and forth from Lebanon to Sardinia to pick up weapons for the group. For that service, he was paid a fee, which went to fund the organization."
"The Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization active in Italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s. The link between crime and terror is established very early on in the Cold War. The first stage is the state sponsor of terrorism. The second one is the privatization of terrorism, and the third is the globalization of terror."
"In the 1970s and '80s, some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism. This is when arms organization were able to link up, also financially, with each other. globalization and deregulation also brought back rogue economics, says Simon Tisdall."
"Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history. It comes back at times of great transformation, globalization being one of those transformations. It is at this times in which politics loses control of the economy, and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us."
"The U.S. in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror, illegal and criminal economy. The situation changed, of course, after 9-11, because George Bush launched the War on Terror. This is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy."
"Patriot Act banned U.S.-registered foreign banks from doing business with off-shore facilities. Money-laundering activities moved from the United States to Europe. The same thing happened, of course, in the world of crime and terror."
"Ryan Lobo is a documentary filmmaker and former member of the Red Brigades. Lobo says he was inspired by a childhood friend to join the terror group. He says he decided that it was he, not the camera or network, that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning."
"Photography has transcended culture, including my own. And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible, and gives voice to people and stories without. I invite you into three recent stories of mine, which are about this way of looking, if you will."
"Photographer John Defterios travelled to Liberia to document the country's war-torn past. He saw a man beg for forgiveness from the same woman whose brother he had murdered. He also met a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace-keeping skills. But the question is, does forgiveness replace justice?"
"Many of the women are married with children, and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children. In 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, which, during the summer, is probably the world's most active police force."
"Firefighters were attacked by angry crowds as they tried to put out a fire in a slum. The firemen were forced to run through hostile crowds wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury. 45 percent of the 14 million people who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums, which are chronically overcrowded."
"The firemen were using no protective clothing. The heat was so intense, that hoses were used to cool down firefighters. The story helped change perceptions about the DFS, at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions, read magazines."
"Mister Splashy Pants got 78 percent of the votes. The next highest name pulled in three. The Internet got behind the campaign. Greenpeace wanted to give it another week of voting, so they changed it to Fightin' Splashy. It's a great name; everyone wants to hear their news anchor say it."
"Greenpeace created an entire campaign around the meme. The Internet provides a level playing field, no matter how much money you have. It costs nothing to get content online, as long as you keep net neutrality in place. It's important to keep the Internet open and free."
"Reddit.com is a social news website with a democratic front page. A half million people visit the site every day. In the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes and trends get born on the site. If you want to succeed you've got to be OK to lose control."
"""Mister Splashy Pants"" is the Farsi word for ""immortal"" ""Splashy"" means ""divine power of the ocean"" in a Polynesian language. Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it."
The Oriental Scarlet is a species of dragonfly found in the Maldives. It lays its eggs in fresh water. The larva lives for 10 or 11 months. The adult lives for one or two months. It is essentially a freshwater animal.
"The Globe Skimmer is found in the tropics, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly, but it has a rather amazing story to tell. It is found on the Maldives, an island chain off the southwest coast of India."
"Hundreds of dragonflies were spotted in the Maldives. They are a species of Globe Skimmer. They need fresh water to breed. They come every year to the Maldivian archipelago. They can be seen in the capital, Malé."
"India is built entirely of coral reefs. On top of the coral reefs are sand banks. When it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil. There is no surface fresh water in India. There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes, nothing like that."
"The phenomenon is a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia, including the Maldives. In India there is plenty of water, so, dragonflies, yeah, of course. But in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?"
"Maldives is a long archipelago. It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here. It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India. But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind. How on Earth are they doing that?"
"I wanted to know about their seasonality, what time of year, this is when they first arrive, but how long are they around for? Does that give any clues? So, I started a very rigorous scientific process. I got on my bicycle, and I cycled around the island of Malé. It's about five kilometers around, counting the dragonflies as I go."
"The dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon, but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. The larvae have to develop very quickly. There is nothing for them in Maldives. They're making it all the way across to East Africa."
"The blue whale is one of the best places in the world to see blue whales. The species can fly for thousands of kilometers. They are breeding in the rains of Africa. They only take six weeks, instead of 11 months, they're six weeks."
"The summer monsoon is a time of maximum heat, evaporation, clouds and rainfall in southern Africa. The sun is overhead, the wind is always converging to where the rain is falling, so the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising."
"This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers, four generations, for a two inch long insect. It is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect. But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing. There is more to the story. This is a rather special bird."
"The Amur Falcon breeds in Amurland, an area along the Amur River. The whole population moves south. They have a refueling stop in northeastern India. They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa. And then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya."
"Several birds of prey make the crossing from India to Africa. They make use of exactly the same winds. They travel at the same altitude. One of these met an unfortunate end 21 years ago, off the coast of Goa, in 1988."
"Shakespeare's famous line 'Juliet is the sun' is a metaphor for the sun. metaphors are a way of mixing and matching metaphors to create a more vivid understanding of a thing. In the summer India heats up, gets very hot, so the dragonflies use the same winds."
Metaphor lives a secret life all around us. We utter about six metaphors a minute. We all have synesthetic abilities. People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters. Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns; it is the creation of patterns.
Metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others. Many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic. The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literalmeaning gives the wrong answer. The participants took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences.
"""Some jobs are jails"" is a metaphor for ""the market"" ""The market"" means ""the price of something"" "" The market"" is the price of a thing. ""The price of the thing"" is ""the value of that thing"""
We cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor. Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery. We compare what we know with what we don't know. The only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the former.
"""All Shook Up"" is a great love song. It's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract -- ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts -- we inevitably resort to metaphor. Metaphor shakes things up, giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process."
"Fusion, wind and solar energy will be the future of energy, says Lord Tebbit. The key question is 'when are we going to get fusion?' nuclear power stations, he says. ""We have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply"""
"Fusion is the process of joining hydrogen and helium together to make helium. It's been known since the 1920s, but has only just been discovered. The process is very complex and takes a long time to work out. But it is possible to do it with a small nucleus."
"Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5. Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out. If you can get something to about 150 million degrees, things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration."
We have a few tens of years of fossil fuel left. We don't have enough uranium to power the world. We need fast-breeding technology to make more fuel. We will have to rely on nuclear power. We have to use nuclear power to make electricity. We can't rely on coal.
"""We have to hold something at 150 million degrees. And, in fact, we've done this. We hold it with a magnetic field"" ""We have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water"" ""I ate the disliked ones first, because the ones you like, you want to save"""
Scientists are building a device that could produce 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth. Seven nations are involved in building the device in southern France. It's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of Fusion power.

"The most renewable energy we have is our own potential, and our own passion. Changing altitude, in life, that means raising to another psychological, philosophical, spiritual level.

"Solar Impulse is a project to fly around the world in a solar powered airplane, using absolutely no fuel. The idea is that nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars, for heating systems, for computers, and so on."
"With 200 square meters of solar power on our plane, we can produce the same energy than 200 little lightbulbs. That means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree. People will tell you it's impossible, and that's exactly why we try to do it."
"The goal is to take off, end of this year for the first test, but mainly next year, spring or summer, without additional help. The same time we load the batteries, we run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height, we arrive at the beginning of the night. There will be just one goal, just one: reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty."
"When Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, the payload was just sufficient for one person and some fuel. 20 years later there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic. The success will not come if we ""just,"" quote, unquote, fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane."
A new study shows that some of the neurons in the brain that control movement are activated when someone else is doing the same thing. It's almost as though the brain is performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action. This is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to join the SolarImpulse team.
"University of California, San Francisco, professor explains how the human brain evolved. He says the brain developed a sophisticated mirror neuron system, which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions. This made evolution suddenly Lamarckian, instead of Darwinian, he says."
"There are mirror neurons, just as there are mirror neuron for action, there are Mirror neurons for touch. If somebody touches me, my hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires. But the same neuron, in some cases, will fire when I simply watch another person being touched."
"You are connected not just via Facebook and Internet, you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons. There is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness. If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom, you watch somebody else being touched, you feel it in your phantom."
"The brain is made up of 100 billion neurons. Each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain. The number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe. The mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about consciousness."
"I'm sort of anti-fashion because I don't show the surface, I show what's within. The fashionistas don't really like me because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it, it looks the same. The process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are."
"Nature is my greatest inspiration, says the architect. His new X-ray room is made of lead and steel and weighs 1,250 kilograms. The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete. The only exercise he gets is opening and closing it."
"The artist uses a 1980s drum scanner, which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film. Boeing sent him a 747 in containers and he sent them back an X-ray. The process takes three months solid X-rays of 500 separate components."
"The artist used a recently deceased body to create the image. The coloring adds another level to the X-rays, he says. The work is not accurately colored to how it is in real life, he adds. But he says he likes to use whatever takes his fancy."
"The most difficult things to X-ray are the lightest things, the most delicate things. The first shot I ever did was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know. The second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day."
"The X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be. The problem with using living people is that you get exposed to radiation. To avoid that, to avoid that -- I have to avoid it somehow -- is I use dead people. I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds."
"The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs, and the more time it needs. The longer the exposure goes on for the more detail you get, the better the image. ""I travel beyond the surface and show something for what it's worth,"" he says."
"This year is the 50th anniversary of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars. I'm going to be displaying it in the Victoria and Albert Museum as a light box. I see my projects in my sleep. And I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off."
"The Sardinians pray, the Seventh-Day Adventists pray and the Okinawans have ancestor veneration. But when you're in a hurry or stressed out, that triggers something called the inflammatory response. When you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti-inflammatory state."
These people know their sense of purpose. They have strategies to keep from overeating. They all belong to a faith-based community. They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people. They put their families first. They don't drink too much.
"Only about one out of 5,000 people in America live to be 100. Exercise programs usually start in January; they're usually done by October. Only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives, within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes. To make it to age 100, you not only have to have a very good lifestyle, you also have to win the genetic lottery."
"A 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year old person. The capacity of the human body is about 90 years, a little bit more for women. Life expectancy in this country is only 78."
"Blue Zones aim to find the optimal lifestyle of longevity. The first Blue Zone was found on the island of Sardinia. Sardinian men live the longest, with 10 times more centenarians than Americans. The Sardinian diet is mostly plant-based, accentuated with foods that can carry into the fields."
"Sardinia has the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world. Five times as many centenarians as we have in America. One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer, big killers here in the U.S. And one sixth the rates of cardiovascular disease."
"Okinawa has a plant-based diet, full of vegetables with lots of color in them. They eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting. Instead of serving family style, they serve at the counter, put the food away, and then bring it to the table."
Okinawa has a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends. If you're in a Moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck. In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement. The National Institute on Aging gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.
"Geographic editor wanted me to find America's Blue Zone. America's longest-lived population among the Seventh-Day Adventists concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California. Adventists are conservative Methodists. They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday."
"In America, life expectancy for the average woman is 80. But for an Adventist woman, their life expectancy is 89. And the difference is even more pronounced among men, who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their American counterparts. The Blue Zone project followed about 70,000 people for 30 years."
"Adventists tend to hang out with other Adventists. At an Adventist party you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint. They're talking about their next nature walk, exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray. This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham."

"CNN's John Defterios has been working in the Indian state of Karnataka for more than a decade. He has spent time with the local community, and has learned a lot about their culture. Defterio: ""The people of this part of the country are very proud of their heritage, and they're very proud to be part of this culture"""
The king cobra is a species of snake that lives in India. It is one of the largest snakes in the world. It can grow up to 12 feet in length. The king cobras feed on other snakes. They can also eat other snakes' eggs.
The king cobra is a keystone species in the rainforests of Brazil. Scientists are trying to learn as much as they can about the snake to help protect its habitat. The snakes are the first species on Earth to be so prolific to threaten our own survival.
"All the major rivers in south India are sourced in the Western Ghats, the chain of hills running along the west coast of India. It pours out millions of gallons every hour, and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people. It's not misguided river engineers who are doing all this; it's us."
"There are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild. The range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma. Their nests hatching along the riverside producing hundreds of hatchlings. But then the monsoon arrives, and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam."
"In the winter of 2007 and 2008, dozens of gharials died in the Chambal River. The cause of death was thought to be uric acid poisoning. The river is one of the most polluted in the world, according to the World Health Organisation."
"The Chambal river is one of the last remaining areas of the Ganges river system. The river is home to a number of species of fish, including the endangered Ganges River dolphin. The Ganges is a major source of water for the Indian state of Gujarat."

"In 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears in Qalandar. We rescued over 550 dancing bears. Next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of India. And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice which has been here for centuries."
"The Qalandar community has been in India since the 13th century. They are a marginalized Islamic community who live across India. The bear cubs were being harvested from across the country and being sold and traded. These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each, and used for bear paw soup."
"In the last year alone, thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information, and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable. For example, a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar."

"There are no Jovians. We have names for places where people don't exist. That seems a little silly to me. But obviously the point is that numbers are maps. And within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe? That is the premise of this."
"If the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron, this is a very good map of what could possibly be, says Euler. The icosahedron is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes. Blue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house."
"The universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger, according to a new theory. The theory is that the universe is shaped like a wave pattern. This would be a normal wave pattern, except for the odd undulation in it."
"Kepler, one of my great heroes, realized that these five solids, which I spoke of earlier, were related somehow to the planets, but he couldn't prove it. But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity. So, maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge."

"The promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise, says Anthony Atala. Atala: ""Our main goal, of course, is first, to do no harm"" ""We started implanting some of these structures over 14 years ago,"" he says."
 Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate. Human body is constantly regenerating. Your bones regenerate every 10 years. Your skin regenerates every two weeks. Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over.
"At the time of injury or disease, the body's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body. The challenge occurs when there is an injury. One of the ways that we do that is by using smart biomaterials. This is the first time an organ was ever transplanted."
"The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter. The scaffold is acting only as a cell delivery vehicle. It's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue, and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away. The kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be regenerated to the human."
"In 1954, 55 years ago, scientists first created an engineered blood vessel. Today, they use the same technique to create a scaffold. The scaffold has the same conditions as a human body, 37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen."
"Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity, because you're asking these organs to act on demand. We take a very small piece of the bladder, less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components, muscle, and these bladder specialized cells."
In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled. But we have a major shortage of organs. The material is actually being coated with the cells. When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.
"The most complex solid organs are the vascularized, highly vascularized organs, such as the heart, the liver, the kidneys. The actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat. The number of organ transplants in the U.S. is expected to rise in the coming years."
Researchers use decellularized organs to create functional livers. They use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of the organs. They then perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient's own liver cells.
"90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney, 90 percent. We are able to reproduce the functionality of the liver structure, experimentally. We stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells. And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered."
We prefer organ-specific cells. If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells. We prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors. Some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year period.

"There are two large pivoting doors that allow people to move directly from the outside, in or from the inside, out. The third configuration is a little harder to understand. The balconies have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space."
"The building is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space. The theater uses a system that lifts the orchestra floor, spinning it, changing the rake, taking it back to flat floor, changing rake again. In essence, you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people at will."

We could do the same in cancer. There's no molecular test, there's no sequencing of genes. This is the state-of-the-art."
"Cancer is heterogeneous, and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer. It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells, what we call clonal selection.

"Life is an information process that was restructuring and making new order. The energy density that we see in the greatest amount anywhere in the universe is actually in a PC chip. There is more energy flowing through, per gram per second, than anything that we have any other experience with."
"Technology is accelerating all the aspects of life, he says. It's a branching off from the human form. Technology has its own agenda, like anything, like life itself. He says technology was absent from everybody's thinking until 1952, which happened to be the year of his birth."
"Technology has an urge to give us things, and what it gives us is basically progress. A bacterium, which has no consciousness at all, wants to move towards light. When King Henry of England died, he had 18,000 things in his house, but that was the entire wealth of England."
"When we have a bad idea, the response is not to stop thinking. Instead, we fix it; but most importantly, we relocate it. Nuclear energy, fission, is a really bad idea for bombs. But it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy."
"""There are no bad children. We just have to find them the right place,"" he says. ""It's more than just the stuff in your pocket. It's the choices, the opportunities, the freedoms that you can have."" ""We are all in this together. We are all part of the same process,"" he adds. ""We're all in it together"""
"We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom, he says. ""A free society requires red lights and green lights, otherwise it soon descends into gridlock,"" he adds. ""We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy"""
"After 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated and raised the grade. At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher. We've been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom."
"The total of direct tort cost in the U.S. is about two percent, twice as much as in other countries. The direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg, he says. We need regulation to make sure people don't pollute and such, he adds."
"The U.S. healthcare system has been transformed with defensiveness and universal distrust of the system of justice. Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes, and they no longer even know what's right or wrong. The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up."
"Schools are literally drowning in law, says Peter Bergen. Bergen: ""Tens of thousands of discreet rules, 60 steps to suspend a student from school: It's a formula for paralysis"" Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in America have been threatened by their students with violating their rights, Bergen says."
"Environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project, he says. The process is followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn't like the project. ""It's just absolutely a formula for failure,"" he says of the review process."
"Law gives us the worst of both worlds: anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury. You need a lawyer to run the company, because there's so much law. Life is complicated enough without legal fear. Law is different than other kinds of uncertainties, because it carries with it the power of state."
"Tort reform is ""like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust,"" he says. What's needed is not just to limit claims, but actually create a dry ground of freedom. ""Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn, within which men shall be inviolable,"" Berlin said."
"There are no seesaws, jungle gyms, merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes, nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four, because there's no risk associated with it. Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit. The constitution is only 16 pages long."
"We have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law, she says. The problem is, we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values, she adds. ""We got into this legal quicksand because we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore"""
"G.E. is introducing a handheld ultra-sound device. The device will be available in the next few weeks. It will be able to take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid. The next frontier is listening to the valve sounds, and the breath sounds."
"In 2016, doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes. The Holter Monitor is an example of another obsolete technology, soon to be buried. There's a whole lot better technology coming, and that's part of the change in medicine."
"Heart failure is the number one reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in the U.S. The cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year, which is 80 percent related to hospitalization. 1.2 million Americans have gotten a Nike shoe that connects the sole of the shoe to the iPhone or an iPod."
"The Fitbit is like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer. The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity, and even then, it's not complete. You put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI, and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending."
"The TEDMed speaker has his own EEG at his home, tagged to an alarm clock. The headband monitors your brainwaves continuously, when you're sleeping. The alarm clock also tells others you're awake, which can be a problem, he says."
"Eric Schmidt: ""I didn't think I was a very good sleeper, but actually I did better than average in 50 to 60-year-olds"" ""I was a really good dreamer,"" Schmidt says. ""It's like a managed competition of sleep. ... And really interesting stuff happened"""
"In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs, including heart rhythm, blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc. The access to smartphones and cell phones today is extraordinary. ""Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people, more quickly, than any previous technology"""
AirStrip is a new wireless health care system. It uses sensors to monitor the health of the elderly. AirStrip has teamed up with Qualcomm to develop the technology. The company says it will use the technology to improve health care across the globe.
"Over 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level. More has been learned about the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man. ""It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it's hyper-innovative, and I think it represents the black swan of medicine"""

"Asperger's syndrome is a form of autism. The syndrome is common in young people. It's also common in older people, such as those with Asperger syndrome. The condition can lead to learning difficulties. It can also lead to depression, as well."
" autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind -- good at one thing, bad at something else. Research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with the primary visual cortex. Another kind of mind is the pattern thinker. These are engineers, your computer programmers."
"When does a nerd turn into Asperger, which is just mild autism? You'll see these different kinds of minds. Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights; others have problems with sound sensitivity. An animal is a sensory-based thinker, not verbal."
"The animal mind and mind puts sensory-based information into categories. Man on a horse, and a man on the ground -- that is viewed as two totally different things. Cattle are the same way. A lot of people have difficulty doing that, he says."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at ways to make air travel safer. He says the world needs to work together to improve air travel. Defterio: ""We need to make the world a safer place for people to travel. We need to improve the air travel experience"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the role of the mind in the world. Sutter: ""It's kind of a trade-off between the mind and the body"" He says it's important for children to learn how to use their minds."
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks about the power of the mind to change the world. He says it's important to teach people how to think in new ways. Bouldens: ""We've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds"""
"Autistic kids need to learn how to do something else, he says. They've got to learn to be visual thinkers. They can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers, photography, industrial design. They're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians, your software engineers, your computer programmers."
"Autistic students make great journalists and stage actors, he says. ""You just kind of ... you just have to learn it,"" he says of social skills. ""Mentors are just essential,"" he adds. ""It doesn't matter if what they teach them is old"""
"""If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth, then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire,"" he says. ""The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism"""
"The Prakash Center for Children will have a dedicated pediatric hospital, a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting-edge research facility. The center will integrate health care, education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts."
"The project is called Project Prakash, which means light in Sanskrit. It aims to help blind children in India who have been left blind by birth defects. The project also aims to test the limits of the brain's ability to make new cells."
"A child in Rajasthan, India, suffers from congenital cataracts. The child is given treatment. After treatment, the child gains significant functionality. The story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation."
"Project Prakash aims to understand how the scaffolding of vision gets set up. The brain has this complex task of putting together, integrating, subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful, into what we would consider to be objects. Nobody knows how this integration happens."
The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information. The answer lies in motion and that's what I want to show you in the next clip. Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object. This simple idea has far reaching implications.
"Dylan is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive, and autonomously discovering: What are the objects in this visual input? The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs that a baby, or a child in Project Prakash, would get."
"Researchers tracked eye movement of two children playing Pong. One child was neurotypical, the other was with autism. Video shows that a child with autism can't predict where the ball is going to go in the game. Researchers say the impairment in visual integration could be the manifestation of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism."
"""I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to lie to you,"" says the author of the book. ""I don't want to lie. I want to tell you the truth,"" he says. ""That's why I'm telling you this. I don't lie."""
"When he was in second grade he was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo. He quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist. He would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces, anything for anyone who wanted to use his services. When he was 18 he started his own school."
"Raghava: Salman Rushdie was pissed-off I think because I altered the map of New York, if you notice. I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after 9/11. What was, for me, a very naive observation, turned out to be a disaster."
"When he was a cartoonist, he met an artist who told him that in the night, he dies and in the morning, he is born again. He wanted to be a painter like him, except, he didn't know how to paint. He decided to learn to paint by himself."
"Paintings had to be ""larger than life,"" says artist. ""I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning. I called my friends, painted on their bodies, and had them dance in front of a painting. And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive"""
"The artist has been working with children to create his work. ""They are ruthless, they are honest, but they're full of energy and fun,"" he says of the children. ""I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet,"" he adds."
"The artist has been painting since he was 19 and a half. He met his wife, Netra, when she was 18 and it was love at first sight. He paints on anything, and started sending them around town. He doesn't have the fanciest gadgets at home."
"""I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar"" ""I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again"" ""That's us in New York. Notice one thing, we're equal here. But this brought me a lot of success"""
"With all the press the couple got, they decided to celebrate by getting married. 150 artists volunteered to help them with their wedding. The couple were in the news three years later, but then their mother died. ""I love my mother and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die,"" she says."
"I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind. I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut, because I was painting it from my gut. I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl -- that's me there."
"""I'm a bit of a chicken. I can't deal with any threat. So, I decided it was time to end and go back home,"" he says. ""And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children, to have a new lease on life. And I became a school hero"""

"Cricket is India's longest running soap opera, says the country's prime minister. ""All you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball,"" he says. ""The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket, everybody was alive"""
"Cricket is a game that can be played anywhere in India. The game has been played in dump, alleyways, banks of the Ganges and even in a small patch of land. India won the World Cup in 1983, when there was more 50-over cricket in India than anywhere."
"Cricket has been around for a long time, but only recently has it become a global phenomenon. The sport has become so popular that it has brought in millions of dollars for broadcasters. The World Cup final was the first time cricket has been played in the World Cup."
"Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket. The accident, of course, was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast. And so England invented T20 cricket, and allowed India to hijack it."
"Cricket in India has jumped 20 years into 20-over game. India was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over. But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern, but didn't want to say that."
"The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes. They were people who ran serious companies. And they've started promoting them with huge money. This was the new world, where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product."
"Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago, overnight. He played in Hyderabad, went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport, sat in a private corporate jet. Never would India have thought on this scale before."
"If you were on Preity Zinta's team, if you did well, you got a hug from her. And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more. And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd."
"Players used to earn 250 rupees for a test match, but if you finish in four days you only got 200. Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars. Andrew Flintoff got one and a half million dollars. Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today."
"IPL became the biggest brand in India and, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa, and we had to start the tournament in three weeks. We'd also made cricket the only sport in India, which is a pity, but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big."
"""Step Up 2: The Streets"" is a new movie about hip-hop dancing. The film is based on the book ""Step Up: A Hip-Hop Story"" by David Perry. Perry: ""This is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities"""
"Dance has never had a better friend than technology. Online videos and social networking have created a whole global laboratory for dance. The LXD is a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world. We got Madd Chadd, Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth."
"Dancing is ""not really a conscious decision, ""I'm going to do this next,"" he says. ""It's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music,"" he adds. ""You just got this piece of energy and you just, you're manipulating it"""
"The power of taking one piece of data, another piece ofData, putting it together, and showing the result. Let's look at some data from the U.K. government data, a completely independent site, Where Does My Money Go. It allows anybody to go there and burrow down."
"Every flash on this visualization -- put together by ITO World -- shows an edit in 2009 made to the Open Street Map. The map of Port au-Prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be. Fortunately, just after the earthquake, GeoEye, a commercial company, released satellite imagery with a license."
"The cry of ""Raw data now!"" was heard around the world. Open data movement is afoot, now, around the globe, says John Defterios. ""We have only just started!"" he says. ""I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much, and we have only started!"""
"Cars rarely appear on that third road. The average wage in the U.S. is $20 an hour. At 10 seconds per 3,000 cars, that's 8.3 hours per day. Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year, just for that stop sign."
"Stop signs were invented in 1915, yield signs in 1950. The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely. So, what the world needs now is a new type of sign. It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns."
"Road design makes a difference, particularly intersections, which are signalized and unsignalized. Small roundabouts are starting to appear. They are much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs. So, now that you are all ""Road Scholars,"" don't wait for that sign to be adopted."
"In Beck's case, you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again. It's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists. This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower."
"He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients; luckily, we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys. It just shows you what the power of the mind can do. A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history."
"There were five climbers lost here. The climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit. These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags, the message will be carried up to the gods. That year, Beck's message was answered."
"The expedition was a National Geographic expedition, organized by The Explorers Club. Climbers had two months of preparation, built their camps all the way up the mountain. Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more, and one of my friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over, we would never do it."
"This is a view taken from Camp Three. It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall. You can see the Lhotse face is in profile, it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it, so you put the camp halfway through."
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest; it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest. What happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up. A storm blew in that no one was anticipating. You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit.
"CNN's John Defterios goes to the top of the world's tallest mountain. He finds himself in the middle of a fierce storm. Defterio: ""I was the only doctor on the mountain. I had to lay down on the ground"""
"It was the worst winds I've ever seen. And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher, and completely exposed to the elements. We were in radio contact with some of them. There was total confusion on the mountain; all the stories were confusing."
"CNN's John Sutter reports from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. Sutter: ""It was a scene of complete chaos up there. But they did what they could to stabilize the people"" ""It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet. You can barely stand outside the tent,"" Sutter says."
"Rob was too weak to come down himself, and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude, he was just beyond rescue and he knew it. His wife was home in New Zealand, seven months pregnant with their first child, and Rob asked to be patched into her. Rob was carrying a radio."
"The Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen, and we should have listened to them. Everest is an extreme environment. There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level. It's the last stage of necrosis, just like a scar."
"He was in such a state that he was unable to move. But he had enough energy to get out of the snow and back to his family. He was in a state similar to being in a coma, but with a different brain structure."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at how the human brain works. He says we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way. He predicts that in the not too distant future, an EMT might give a person severe injuries, and they might de-animate."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the idea of suspended animation. Sutter: ""We hope not, or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common"" ""I want to suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures, I want to bring it close to home"""
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how people are brought back to life. Sutter: ""You're not dead until you're warm and dead"" He says a study shows that with appropriate rewarming, people can be brought back. ""These are truly miraculous things that happen,"" Sutter says."
"The concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma is conserved by low oxygen levels. Scientists were able to bring dead animals back to life when they were exposed to low oxygen. If you want to survive the cold, you ought to be suspended, he says."
"""Suspended animation"" is the process by which animals de-animate, appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed. ""We wondered: Might there be some agent that is in us, something that we make ourselves, that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility?"""
"Hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us. The highest concentration is in our brains. Yet, it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I. If you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground, you appear dead."
"The mouse's body temperature drops when it's in a cold environment. The temperature drops by about 10 degrees Fahrenheit. The mouse is no longer in danger of overheating, but it's still cold. The animal is still alive, but its body temperature has dropped."
"With money from DARPA, scientists have been able to lower mice's demand for oxygen. In one model of heart attack, animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and I would receive today."
"The first human studies were done in 2008, and we should know in a couple of years whether it works or not. We're doing a lot of work with people with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's. That quiet voice may be the best early indicator of Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically."
"Intel CEO: How do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that's going to help us with prevention of disease, early onset of disease and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time? We have now lived with 1,000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years. We study people in Rochester, New York. We go with them and we study their entire experience."
"10 years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living, this is what I called it: ""Y2K + 10"" The health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that's coming, and the implications for what we need to do."
"Eric Liu: ""This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door"" Liu: We can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it. ""We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe, and react, as opposed to prepare for it"""
"Intel CEO: ""We worship the high hospital on a hill"" ""We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare"" ""This is a very reactive, crisis-driven system. We're doing 15-minute exams with patients,"" he says."
We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured. We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home. How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7? That's what we need to do for our personal health model.
"Many people in this generation won't press the button, even if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody, Eric Dishman says. It's surreptitious technology that's helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time."
"Researchers are using embedded sensors in carpet and camera-based systems in 600 elderly households in Ireland. The goal is to collect kinematic motion data to understand subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls. ""These discoveries of behavioral markers, and behavioral changes are game changing, and like the discovery of the microscope"""
"Intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research. We need to drive a national, if not international, Framingham-type heart study, he says. ""It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare. We're going to figure something out for the next 10 years"""
"The president needs to stand up and say, ""Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes, to the home, in 10 years,"" he says. ""No matter who pays for it, we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way,"" he adds."
"CNN's Manu Raju is working on a new series on India. The series, ""Paani,"" is based on the city of Bombay. Raju says the city is divided into two parts: the upper city and the lower city. He says the idea for the series came from the idea of the city as a river."
"The film's director says that all of us are constantly looking for harmony. ""Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you, but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that,"" he says. ""In a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities,"" he adds."
"Shekhar Kapur: ""Hollywood and many films"" try to resolve the contradiction. ""Harmony is not resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution,"" Kapur says. ""How many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love,"" he asks."

"Elizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham. You ask my permission before you rut, before you breed. You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business. Is the child his? Is it his? Bess: Yes."
"The film is operating on many many levels in that scene. The architecture is telling a story about how, even though she's the most powerful woman in the world, there is the other, the architecture's bigger. The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic. It'll survive her."
"LZ Granderson: It's possible for people to have beliefs and desires that lead to needless human suffering.

"If we're going to talk about human well-being we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain. Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain. So, in talking about values we are talking about facts."

"Bradley Beale: Why don't we feel compassion for rocks? Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals. In Brazil, they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities, in which most of the cases, the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers."
"Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna, especially birds. Thousands of animals are taken from nature every month, and transported far from their origins. Some researchers, myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative."
"The illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is estimated to be worth almost two billion dollars. Police intercept huge cargos with live animals, intended to supply the pet market. The police end up, every month, with thousands of seized animals. In the eyes of many people, after the animals are seized, they say ""Yay, justice has been served"""

"Mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system, Hellas Basin. The answer is no, there is no liquid water on the surface of Mars today. The National Academy of Science says one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age, is why certain areas of Mars are so highly magnetized."
"Today Mars is very very dry. But there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of Mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water. We believe there's some water in the polar caps, there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole. That's 300 million years per minute."
"The New York Times wrote in its editorial, ""Mars is uninteresting. It's a dead world"" Sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior of Mars contains frozen water, or ice. There is evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars."
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion years old. The crust of the Earth has been recycled. The northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin. There aren't many craters in the southern hemisphere because the water protected the basin from being impacted.

Scientists interviewed 600 drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia to find out how they get HIV. They found that nearly 100 percent of addicts get HIV by sharing needles. The proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10.
"In Indonesia at this time, if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up, they could put you into jail. So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest. Margaret Thatcher put in the world's first national needle exchange program, and other countries followed suit."
"At its peak, one in two injectors in the U.S. was infected with HIV. Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies. She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service."
"HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually. HIV is a very, very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected. The sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia."
"HIV epidemic in southern Africa affects one in seven, one in three of all adults. HIV is only transmitted by unprotected sex with a positive person. In most of the world, condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex. In ""intimate"" relations it's much more difficult."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the impact of not using condoms. Sutter: ""We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can"" He says it's not just a matter of treating the virus, it's also about preventing it from spreading."
"People are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS, he says. HIV's about sex and drugs, and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational, they are erections and addiction. The combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there is outweighing the effects of lower viral load."

"Pollen is tiny, but it's also biologically active, as anyone with hay fever will understand. Pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed, tend to cause the most hay fever. ""I truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun, and that's what we're doing"""
"This is a picture of the pollen from a tree. The pollen is being carried by the wind, not the other way around. This is one of the first examples of pollen being carried in the air. It was first seen in the early 1900s in England."
"Pollen is tiny but it gets on to things, and it sticks to them. Different species of plants grow in different places, and some pollen carries further than others. By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample, you can tell very precisely where it came from."
"Pollen is being used to track where counterfeit drugs have been made, where banknotes have come from. It carries male sex cells from one flower to another. Murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing to within an area that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs."
The average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it. This is the energy it takes to make millions of paper towels. The position in which you put the handle has a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize.
"CNN's John Sutter shows you how to build a green house. Sutter: ""I really want to build green, but I'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles"" ""I'm an organic food-eating, carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek,"" Sutter says."
"Carpeting is about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house. When it comes time to sheetrock, if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter of the energy of standard sheetrock. On the scale of my portion of the house, this is equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year. But my elephant in the living room flies."

"The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range, 40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe. The top of this mountain range is splitting apart, creating a rift valley. Thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time."
"Vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F. The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing. The vent fluid cools, and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it's dissolved. It precipitates out, forming black smoke and tube worms."
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth; it looks like aliens in an alien environment. But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead. And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years.

"In the open ocean environment, virtually anywhere in the world, most of the animals -- in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent -- make light. This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows. In the Gulf of Maine at 740 feet, I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there."
"Bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein. The chemicals have proved so valuable for developing antibacterial agents, cancer fighting drugs."
"This fish has a built-in light that it can use to find food or attract a mate. This fish can also see red light, which is why it has a red light on its head. This is a fish that uses its long teeth to catch prey."

There's jellyfish, squid, crustaceans, there's even fish that can do this,"" she says. ""It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this, and we have no idea why it does it,"" she adds."
The light show is created when a light bulb is turned on. The light is then reflected off the light bulb to create a light show. The effect is similar to the light show on the inside of a lightbulb. It's a way to make light show more visible to the public.

"CNN's John Defterios has been rowing across the Atlantic for the past four years. He decided to take a break from the sport in order to find out what he wanted to do with his life. Defterio: ""I feel like I've got a purpose in this life, but I don't know what it is"""
"CNN's Richard Quest is completing a 3,000-mile journey around the Pacific Ocean. Quest has been rowing for 103 days and is now in the final stages of his trip. Quest: ""I don't think I've ever felt so happy in my entire life"""
"The author has rowed over 8,000 miles, taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat. ""I don't see anybody for the whole time that I'm at sea,"" he says."
"The Pacific Ocean is 65 million square miles and covers half the planet. To row in a straight line across it would be about 8,000 miles. The first attempt didn't go so well and the rower had to capsize three times in 24 hours."
"The North Pacific Garbage Patch is twice the size of Texas. There are an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it. The North Pacific Gyre is at the center of that North Pacific gyre. The Gyre was formed by 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into pontoons."
"It took a week for the pair to meet up after a delay caused by a problem with the lids on their water bottles. They caught a beautiful, big mahi-mahi, which was the best food they'd had in three months."
"Roxanne Jones is the first woman to row solo across the Pacific Ocean. She says she wants to use her experience to raise awareness of environmental issues. Jones: ""I think there are probably three key points here. The first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about how we can make a difference to the environment. Sutter: ""We have the power of free will to choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones"" ""We can start making better, wiser, more sustainable decisions,"" he says."
"CNN's John Defterios is launching a new initiative called Eco-Heroes. The idea is that all our Eco- heroes will log at least one green deed every day. Defterio: ""I plan on being around for a long time, and when I'm 90, I want to be happy and healthy"""
"George Whitesides: ""If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology and then give it to you guys, you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it"" ""You can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis,"" Whitesides says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the complexity of the word ""simplicity"" Sutter: ""There are two ways of thinking about this word, I think"" He says we can think about something by saying that it's simple, the functions are simple, and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it. Sutter says there are many ways to answer the question of why water is hot."
"Simplicity, for reasons that are a little bit obscure, is almost not pursued, at least in the academic world. The nice thing about complexity is it's fundamentally intractable in many ways, so you're not responsible for outcomes. The words that I would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence, because these will enable you to start the conversation."
"The cell maintains a stable working relationship with other cells, but we don't know why. The amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable relationship. The trouble is, I don't. Anyone who tells you that we understand life, walk away."
"The Internet starts with mathematics, it starts with binary. In binary, one is 0001, seven is 0111. The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way of representing numbers. It is very, very simple once you learn how to read it."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the history of the Internet. Sutter: The first step was the transistor, which is nothing more than a wall switch. The next step was integrated circuits, which allowed people to hack their cell phones. From that comes the Internet, Sutter says."
"Google is a simple idea that rests on layers of simplicity and complexity. The characteristics of simple things are predictable, cheap and reliable, he says. If you have things that are cheap enough, people will find uses for them, even if they seem very primitive."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about how to make cheap, functional things. He says the key is to make things that have a high performance or value for cost. Defterio: ""There's no way of predicting the first transistor. It just is not possible"""
"The device uses the same technology that you use for making comic books. The handle enables you to hold it when the container is filled with hot liquid. ""I would like to change the way, or maybe eviscerate, the U.S. health care system"""
"Most favorite TEDTalks feature topics we can connect with, both easily and deeply. The more technical topics, such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men, are not good topics to talk about. The most favoriteTEDTalks are on average, over 50 percent longer than the least favorite ones."
"The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker. Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website. If you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers, make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up than the average TED speaker."
"The TEDPad is a matrix of 100 specifically selected, highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk. You only have to make one decision, and that is: Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks, about creativity, human genius? Or do you go with a black version, which will allow you to create really bad TEDT talks?"
"The top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favoriteTEDTalks. If you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains, that's a go. Whereas, if you wanted to talk. about your project involving oxygen, girls, aircraft -- actually, I would like to hear that talk, but statistics say it's not so good."
"Malaria kills almost 900,000 people every year, most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. Every year at least 25 million children do not get the immunization they should get. The world has spent a lot of money on it. The technology is there, the infrastructure is there and yet it doesn't happen."
"Only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net. Societies should be willing to subsidize the net, give them for free, or, for that matter, pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits. Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage, or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them?"
"It's not the Middle Ages anymore, it's the 21st century. In the 20th century, randomized, controlled trials have revolutionized medicine. You can put social innovation to the same rigorous, scientific tests that we use for drugs. And in this way, you can take the guesswork out of policy-making."
"Every day, 25,000 children die of entirely preventable causes in India, according to the World Health Organization. The Udaipur District in Rajasthan is one of the worst places in the country to get children immunized. A new program aims to make it easy and give people a reason to act now."
"A kilo of lentils increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent. That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days. Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway, the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives."
"If you give bed nets for free, are people going to use them? Do free bed nets discourage future purchase? If people get used to handouts, it might destroy markets to distribute free nets. When people have to pay for their bed nets, the coverage rate really falls."
"Politicians need a range of options to achieve their goals, she says. ""People do not get used to handouts,"" she adds. ""So what's the best? I don't know. Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit"""
"In technology, we spend so much time experimenting, fine-tuning, so why aren't we doing that with social policy? Well, with experiments, what you can do is answer a simple question. How many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars? Now I'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions."
"CNN's John Sutter asks why we don't spend more on fighting poverty. Sutter: For every dollar we spend, we get almost 30 extra years of life. He says we need to spend more money on education, health care, and prevention."
"Poverty in Haiti is ""localized"" and ""mostly invisible,"" he says. ""There's no silver bullet. You cannot helicopter people out of poverty,"" he adds. ""We cannot eradicate poverty just yet, but we can get started"""

"Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world: those made by a higher authority and those that are made by men. Leaders hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us, he says. ""We followed, not for him, but for ourselves"""
"Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent. Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP. But very, very few people or organizations know why they dowhat they do."
"If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: ""We make great computers. Want to buy one?"" That's how most of us communicate. We say what we do, we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior."
" Gateway is eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs, he says. Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors, he adds. ""People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it,"" he writes. ""The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe"""
The human brain is broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle. The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains and are responsible for trust and loyalty.
"If you don't know why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you, or buy something from you? The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell people who believe what you believe. Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers."
"Orville and Wilbur Wright had no money; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop. Not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education. Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He was in pursuit of the result. And lo and behold, look what happened."
"Langley: People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. Langley: I love asking businesses, ""What's your conversion on new business?"" They love to tell you, ""It's about 10 percent,"" proudly. The law of diffusion of innovation tells us that if you want mass-market success, you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point."
"Jeffrey Moore: We all have about 10% who just ""get it"" Moore: How do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who don't get it? Moore: People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it."
"When TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago, they are the single highest-quality product on the market, hands down, there is no dispute. But TiVo's a commercial failure. They've never made money. When they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted."
"In 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date. He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed."
"As the surface of the ocean gets warmer, the water is lighter when it's warmer. The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries, of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever, those slow down and those fisheries collapse."
"Coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime. Overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents recovery. ""It's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being, because it just keeps getting worse,"" he says."
"In the 1950s and 1960s, the biggest fish in the ocean were about 300 pounds. The fish were so big that it was cheaper to catch them than to buy them. The cod industry in the U.S. collapsed in the 1980s."
"Industrial fishing uses nets that are 20 miles long and longlines that have one million or two million hooks. The area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud, to parking lot is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity."
"Caulerpa taxifolia, the so-called killer algae, was accidentally released from an aquarium in Monaco. It has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean. We don't know anything that eats it, we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done."
"Toxic blooms are often called red tides or toxic blooms. In the Gulf of Mexico, one toxic dinoflagellate bloom can kill fish. The beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis. And then, of course, there's climate change."
"Coral reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years. When it gets too hot, the algae can't make the sugar. The corals say, ""You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."" They kick them out and then they die."
"CNN's John Sutter asks: What happens when 80 percent of the world's coral reefs die? Sutter says the answer is that the reefs will grow bigger and bigger. Sutter: ""It's like the world is in a state of war with itself. It's a war of attrition"""
"Ivan Appachan was a pioneer in the field of sustainable agriculture in India. He is best known for developing a cycle cycle that can be used as a rescue device in floods. The cycle has been sold internationally, but not yet used for rescue purposes."
"Professor David Cameron says we need to learn from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are. ""None of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country,"" he says.

"Honey Bee Network: whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language. The profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous.

"Every year, 99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually. No machines have been developed for the task. An anonymous, faceless, nameless person gets in contact with the network, and then gets an identity. This is what Honey Bee Network is about."
"People may be economically poor, but they're not poor in the mind, he says. Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints, they were all poor people, and they had a great reason. Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment, only by the resolve that they must achieve something."
"In Motihari in Champaran, there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack. Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee. A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground. If we can create markets for artists, we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones."
"Sheikh Jahangir: 'If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them, he brought a washing machine to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler' 'Charge 50 paisa, one rupee for you per lot, and a new business model can emerge' 'We need people who will be able to scale them up'"
"When you have a non-stick pan, it costs about, maybe, 250 rupees, five dollars, six dollars. With one dollar, you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you. This lady, she developed a herbal pesticide formulation. We filed the patent for her, the National Innovation Foundation. Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products."
"In the scaling up, there's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people, point by point, with the supply that you're making. So what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability. There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality."
"I think we form social networks because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs. I became obsessed with how it might be that we're embedded in these social networks, and how they affect our lives. I think, in fact, that if we realized how valuable social networks are, we'd spend more time nourishing them."
"In 2000, there were 2,200 people in Chicago with a BMI of 30 or higher. The number of people with a body mass index above 30 was called clinically obese. The BMI is a measure of a person's weight, but it can also be a proxy for body fat."
"If your friend is obese, your risk of being obese is 25 percent higher. If you and your friend share a similar body size, the risk is even higher. This is known as the ""clustering"" effect. It's not a behavior, but rather an idea that spreads."
"The obesity epidemic is not a unicentric epidemic, he says. It's a multicentric epidemic. The dots will appear and disappear, ties will form and break, marriages and divorces, friendings and defriendings. The dot sizes are going to grow, you'll see a sea of yellow take over."
"When we have emotions, we show them, and others can read and copy them. Emotions are a kind of primitive form of communication. There's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations. If we really want to understand human emotions we need to think about them in this way, he says."
"Emotional contagion can be broader still. Maybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot that animates us all the time. Maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes. Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence, not just an individual existence."
"Human social networks always look like this: the picture of the network. Why don't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice? Well, the striking patterns of human social Networks beg questions about whether we evolved to have human networks in the first place."
"46 percent of variation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes. 47 percent in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable toYour genes. Some people knit together the networks around them, creating a dense web of ties in which they're comfortably embedded."
30 percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes. New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks. It is the ties between people that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
"Human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism. The inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine. This is our second generations prototype. The third generation prototype is, right now, in Uganda being tested. This lasts six months with no power; absolutely zero power, because it loses less than a half a watt."
"Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies; 27 will die during my talk. There are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria. A vaccine would be a terrific thing, only they don't work yet. It vends out little individual vials."
The team is working on a system that can detect malaria using blood. They hope to have the system in place by the end of the year. The team is also working on ways to make the disease easier to treat. The project is called Malaria Isolation.
"phthalmologist: ""We're kind of software guys, and so nearly any problem that you pose, we like to try to solve with some software"" ""We do this fun and profit-oriented inventing for most of what we do, but we also have a program where we invent for humanity,"" he says."
The world's best computer model of malaria has been created. It shows the spread of the disease across the island nation of Madagascar. The model is based on data from the weather and the amount of water in the area. It also shows how the disease spreads from one area to the next.
"Computer simulations simulate malaria eradication thousands of times in software. By understanding how mosquitoes fly, scientists hope to understand how to make them not fly. One of the ways you can make mosquitoes not fly is with DDT. In 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the United States."
"Lasers could be used to kill mosquitoes and protect clinics, farmers. The lasers could also protect your backyard. Moore's law made computing cheap; so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down. But the lasers only kill the female mosquitoes."
A laser pointer can be used to track mosquitoes. The laser can pick up the wing-beat frequency of the insects. The device was built with parts from eBay. It can be seen on a computer screen or lit up with a laser.
" NM: That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing. EJ: Finally, let's see what this looks like. NM: So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em."
"CNN's Chris Anderson goes back to the past to see what the ocean was like. The animals at the lower parts of the food chain reproduce very fast; they grow really fast. Up there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years. They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism."
"The world is spending 35 billion dollars a year on subsidies for fishing subsidies. It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas, he says. The World Trade Organization should shift the subsidies to sustainable practices, he adds."
"Enric: ""If it were not for these places that show hope, I don't think I could continue doing this job"" ""I'm going to tell you two things today: One is what we have lost, and two, a way to bring it back"" ""This is what many divers would consider paradise,"" he says."
"In some places like Palmyra Atoll, the corals are doing better and there are sharks in every single dive. The good news is that, in addition to having more predators, there's more of everything, he says. ""When we went to pristine reefs, we realized that the natural world was upside down"""
"Giant clams have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world. They filter the water; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens. The water gets warmer for too long and the corals die. The fish clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen, they eat."
"The more intact the food web, the more likely it is to recover from global warming. Protected areas like the Medes Islands Marine Reserve are a good place to start, he says. The area brings 6 million euros to the local economy, 20 times more than fishing."
"The number of species increases 21 percent; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve. The size of organisms increases a third, so your fish are now this big. The abundance, how many fish you have per square meter, increases almost 170 percent."
"There are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them. The increase of biomass inside the reserves, this is like compound interest. Reserves are like savings accounts. We have this principal that we don't touch; that produces returns, social, economic and ecological."
"Fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year. ""It doesn't take rocket science to figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year, your fishery is going to collapse very quickly,"" he says. Only a fraction of the ocean is fully protected from fishing."
A network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people. The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people. Most coastal communities around the world don't have the authority to monitor the resources.

"""Deadwood"" creator David Milch called it, ""an impatience with irresolution"" He swore off creating contemporary drama, shows set in the present day. He saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of, for example, ""Two and a Half Men,"" it shapes the neural pathways."
"The problem set is actually four separate layers. When they're compressed together and presented to the student all at once, how that creates this impatient problem solving. If we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students, we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient solution."
"In the U.S. here, we just give problems to students; we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem, he says. The math serves the conversation, the conversation doesn't serve the math, he adds. ""Nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing"""

"Inhibiting angiogenesis may also have an application for obesity. The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat. If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenic inhibitor, it loses weight."
"The body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time. When those excess vessels are no longer needed, the body prunes them back to baseline. The body does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances, stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis."
"There are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide. All share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator. Excessive angiogenic drives disease, and we see this in cancer, blindness, arthritis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease."
"The body's ability to balance angiogenesis, when it's working properly, prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers. Without a blood supply, most of these cancers will never become dangerous. Once those vessels invade the cancer, it can expand, and the same vessels allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases."
"Antiangiogenic therapy has been used to treat cancer in dogs, dolphins and horses. The treatment has a 60 percent response rate and improved survival for pets that were about to be euthanized. The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries. We've got 19 billion of them in our bodies."
"Antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers. The first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs, are already becoming available. There are 12 different drugs, 11 different cancer types. But the real question is: How well do these work in practice?"
"Cancer is caused by the growth of blood vessels, called angiogenesis. Scientists have developed a test system to see if certain foods can prevent angiogenic growth. The active ingredient is resveratrol, which is also found in red wine."
"Chinese jasmine, Japanese sencha, Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared were tested. The teas vary in their potency, from less potent to more potent. When we combine the two less potent teas together, the combination, the blend, is more potent than either one alone."
"A study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week, had up to a 50 percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer. In those men who did develop prostate cancer, those who ate more servings of tomato sauce, actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer."

"Penguins can swim 173 kilometers in a day, faster than any Olympic swimmer. Emperor penguins can go down more than 500 meters and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes. They're comical, they walk upright, and, of course, they're diligent."
"The Galapagos Islands are home to some of the world's rarest penguins. The islands have a population of about 2,000 penguins, which is about a quarter of what it was 40 years ago. The penguins are important because of their ability to communicate with each other."
"The Galapagos Islands are affected by an extreme El Nino event. When the water is cold, there's no upwelling, and there's basically no food for penguins. The cold water brings nutrients that provide food for the penguins, sea lions and iguanas."
"Penguin population has declined by about 21 percent since 1987. Punta Tombo is the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude. Some years, cold water goes all the way up to Brazil, and other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't."
"In some years, more than 80 percent of the adult penguins found in Argentina were covered in oil. The penguins were swimming through ballast water that had oil in it. In some ways, the problem is worse in Argentina than in other places."
"The number of penguins in the world has doubled in the last decade. The number of birds in the wild has also increased. The increase in numbers is caused by the number of people living near the penguins. The more people live near the birds, the more likely it is that the birds will reproduce."
"Penguins are going about, on average now, 40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago. They're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world. We need to be able to get information out to the general public. We're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions."
"Penguins differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats, he says. penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another, he adds. ""We're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate,"" the scientist says."
"Penguins are playing king of the box, he says. ""Only you can change the world and make it better, for people as well as penguins,"" he adds. ""I had never lived alone for any period of time, and I'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night"""
"Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining. Peak gas is ahead of us a few decades, and beyond that, peak renewables. Energy systems of the world becoming progressively less carbon-intense. renewables could reach maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid century."
"The talk will be broadly about energy, but oil's a good place to start. Here's a piece of limestone. It's about 400 million years old. And it's just limestone, nothing really special about it. And here's an abalone shell. Millions of abalone every year make this shell."
"The abalone shell self-assembles, millions of abalone, all the time, every day, every year. The oil will never run out. It's not because we have a lot of it. Imagine what would it be like if instead of this, we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently."
"There's about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today. The Stone Age ended not because we ran out of stones, but because people invented ideas. Oil has been a dominant part of our energy system for most of the past 150 years."
It's been a 15-year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions. We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide. We think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date.
"In 2003, Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed new methods for making error-free DNA at a small level. Their first task was a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage. Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another."
"In 2008, scientists created the first self-replicating genome. But they had to find a way to get the DNA out of yeast and into a recipient cell. The problem was that the DNA in the cell was methylated, preventing it from digesting DNA."
The genome of the Mycoplasma genitalium is the first of its kind to be sequenced. The genome is made up of more than a million base pairs. It took more than two years to find a way to sequence the genome without destroying it.
"Watermarks in the DNA make clear that the DNA is synthetic. Watermarks contain the names of, I think it's 46 different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage. The first one contains a code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code."
"Scientists say they have found the smallest genome of a self-replicating species. The work was reviewed at the level of the White House to decide whether to classify the work or publish it. ""It's taken us 15 years to be able to do the thing we wanted to do 15 years ago,"" says Dr. Craig Vihl."
" NIH is funding a program with Novartis to try and use these new synthetic DNA tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year. Instead of taking weeks to months to make these, Dan's team can now make these in less than 24 hours. We think we can shorten that process quite substantially."

"Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough. Reform is no use anymore, because that's simply improving a broken model. What we need is not evolution, but a revolution in education. It means challenging what we take for granted, things that we think are obvious."

"When he got to the senior year of school, my teachers didn't take it seriously. He said I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it. At the heart of our challenges is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence."
"Schneider: We have built our education systems on the model of fast food. He says there are two models of quality assurance in catering. One is fast food, where everything is standardized. The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants, he says."
"Human talent is tremendously diverse. People have very different aptitudes. Often, people are good at things they don't really care for. It's about passion, and what excites our spirit and our energy. If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit, five minutes feels like an hour."
"""We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of human flourishing,"" he says. ""You cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do is create the conditions under which they can flourish"" ""There are many great models, but we need to create our own,"" he adds."
"The courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection. It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo. The reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided it was too utilitarian. Without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate."
"Because there's no copyright protection in this industry, there's a very open and creative ecology of creativity. Fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry. They can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design."
Fashion designer Tom Ford talks about the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry. Fast fashion giants are notorious for knocking off high-end designs and selling them at very low prices. Ford: The people on Santee Alley are not the ones who shop at Gucci.
"Cultural critics have pointed to that we now have a much broader palette of design choices. Fashion, whether you like it or not, helps you project who you are to the world. Because of fast fashion, global trends get established much more quickly than they used to."
"Fashion designer Stuart Weitzman says copying his designs forced him to be more innovative. Charlie Parker invented bebop because he was sure white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. Fashion designers are trying to put together a signature look, an aesthetic that reflects who they are."
"In Japan, for instance, you have to prove that your garment has never existed before. In the European Union, anybody can register anything. Diane von Furstenberg has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs."
"Retailers have quashed this notion though. They realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that's just part of a global trend. You cannot copyright a recipe because it's a set of instructions, and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish."
"Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool. Jokes, no copyright protection. Fireworks displays, the rules of games, the smell of perfume: no. All they have, really, is trademark protection, and so it means that anybody could copy any garment."
"Digital technology has subverted the logic of this physically fixed, expression versus idea concept. Digital technology is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds. And these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily, actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects."
"The developing world sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they're leapfrogging the West. India, Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines. Because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap, billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them."
"SB: We seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared, but this threat could reappear at any time. SB: The problem we have now is we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans; we just need a better one. So, the challenge is full speed ahead."
"SB: We've got a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now. SB: We're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines. With new or better vaccines for malaria, TB, HIV, pneumonia, diarrhea, flu, we could end suffering, he says."
"Vaccines create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed. Until recently, we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked. This worked well for most pathogens, somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu, but not at all for HIV, for which humans have no natural immunity."
"A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader. Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the front-line troops. Without a vaccine, these responses would have taken more than a week."
"Every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu. In 2003, we had an H5N1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases. HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar. The real question then is: How do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect?"
"The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted. In the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS, we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together. Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine, but evidence tells us otherwise."
"Researchers have found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto. This strategy, working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate, has never been done before in vaccine research. The research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases."
" retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design. Every year, 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu. So far, animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease, although you might get a mild case."
"In the early 1940s, flu vaccines were made from millions of living chicken eggs. Today, we get our flu vaccines from hundreds of millions of chicken egg. The system is reliable but you never know how well a strain is going to grow. This year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production."
"In 2004, the U.S. supply of flu vaccine was cut in half by contamination at one plant. The process still takes more than half a year. With a range of new technologies, we could. produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world."
"GOP Sen. Ted Cruz: ""Openness is a commitment to a certain set of values. We need to speak of those values"" Cruz: If we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right, if we can take them and incorporate them, maybe we could do a little trade."
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks about the role of the church in society. He says it's important to keep the church out of the market place. Bouldens: ""There are places for the market and places where we should be free to enjoy"""
"Conservative thinkers understand ""free"" is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well. The first great Republican president of the 20th century, Teddy Roosevelt, taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources. They recognize: Both of these things have to live together."
"Lloyd Bell: remixing is an act of social creativity. Bell: It's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end, it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other. Bell was the youngest member of any delegation in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan."
"Julian Zelizer: Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity. It's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities, he says. Zelizer says it's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the history of remixing. He says it's not a new phenomenon. Sutter: ""It's a new way of looking at the world. It's a different way of seeing the world"" He says the fight to extend the copyright term of Disney's ""Steamboat Bill"" was a success."

"CNN's John Defterios talks about the issue of free speech on the Internet. He says it's an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging. Defterio: ""We've forgotten to invent new interfaces. Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change"""
"Computer programmers don't understand the concept of space, says Andrew Keen. Keen: ""When you use a mouse, your hand is down here on the mouse pad. It's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about"" He says computers should be able to store information in a way that makes sense."
"Computer scientists have created an interface that lets you operate the world as you would with your hands. The system can project down digital shadows and control the sun's position in the sky. It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation, thought about computers, how they used them."
"MIT's Media Lab designed the interfaces for Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" The work is 15 years old, but some of the ideas are still relevant today. The Media Lab's Spatial Operating Environment is designed to be the future of human interface."
The OS is the interface. You have to be able to navigate in 3D. Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial. The part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense.
"phthalmologist: ""We're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in, not in 2D, but in actual 3D"" ""One thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three-dimensional and geospatial information"" ""We really love yellow and tapirs on green grass. That's what we really love"""
"The new operating system was not a capricious matter. The computation is space soluble and network soluble. It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines. It's like the land and the king (i.e. Arthur) they're inseparable, they are one."
"TAMPER is a whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be. We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine-grained form. And finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery."
"Juan Uribe: Technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity. He says we can't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start. JU: We're, as human beings, the creatures that create, and we should make sure that our machines aid us."
"In five years time when you buy a computer, you'll get this. The gloves go away in a matter of months or years. Networks, we didn't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh's introduction, and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers."
"CNN's John Sutter is a photographer for National Geographic magazine. Sutter: Harp seals are being hunted, killed with hakapiks at about eight, 15 days old. He says the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming. The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse."
CNN's John Sutter has been photographing fish since he was a child. Sutter's latest project is a story on the decline of big fish in the ocean. He says he wanted to give readers a sense of what they're eating.

"CNN's John Sutter has been photographing sharks for 30 years. Sutter: ""I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea"" Sutter found a thresher that had just recently died in the gill net in the Bahamas. ""I hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of 100 million sharks"""
"The Atlantic's whitetip shark population has declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years. CNN's John Sutter traveled to Bimini, in the Bahamas, to work with lemon shark pups. Sutter: ""I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story"""
"The leatherback turtle is the largest, widest-ranging, deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species. Despite this amazing longevity, they're now considered critically endangered. Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity. The species' future is in great danger."
The North Atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet. They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean. They also get entangled in fishing gear. So all of these ills are stacking up against them and keeping their numbers very low.
"CNN's John Sutter returns to New Zealand to tell the story of the country's marine reserves. Sutter: ""I wanted this story to be about abundance, about diversity and about resilience"" ""We can't go back and see that today, but maybe we can preserve what we have left"""

"""Wonders of the Solar System"" is a new series on CNN.com. This week, CNN's John Sutter looks at a picture sent back by the Cassini space probe. Sutter: ""We live in difficult and challenging economic times, of course"""
"Cassini flew beneath Enceladus to find fountains of ice rising up from the surface. The mechanism for powering those fountain requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon. On our planet, on Earth, wherever we find liquid water, we find life."
"This is a famous picture taken by Apollo 8 as it went around the back of the moon. It may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions: ""Are we alone in the universe?"" We think it's saltwater, and that would mean that there's more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined."
"For every $1 spent on Apollo, 14 came back into the U.S. economy. The Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration, in engineering, achievement and, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over. The next slide is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen."
" quantum theory led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon. The way that silicon behaves, the fact that you can build transistors, is a purely quantum phenomenon. One of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics is that there can be no stars in the universe that are bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun."
"This is the picture of a galaxy, a common ""our garden"" galaxy with, what, 100 billion stars like our Sun in it. That bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy. It's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about the power of serendipity in science. He says science can be beautiful and reveal astonishing things about the universe. It can also reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe, he says."
"The Voyager spacecraft visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. It then turned around and took a picture of every planet it had visited. The Voyager is a tiny machine. It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth, transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts."
"""No magic"" is one of the 10 commandments of science. The first is that we know enough about the universe. The second is that there are no mysteries in nature. The third is that science is funded by the UK's 3.3 billion pounds per year."
"The video was shot in a 10,000-square-foot space divided between two floors. The director wanted the action to follow the song feeling, not the other way around. The music would travel some distance, react along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck."
It took us 85 takes to get this shot. We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process. And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers left it in a pile of stuff. We learned that small stuff stinks.

"According to Aristotle, justice means giving people what they deserve. Michael Sandel: One thing the world needs, one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates. The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why, Sandel says."
"Peter: We'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to best flute players. MS: Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason. Peter: We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument. The point of musical performance is to produce excellent music, Aristotle says."
"Case of Casey Martin, who sued the PGA for permission to use a golf cart. Law says the disabled must be accommodated, provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity. One of the reasons that the best flute players should get thebest flutes is to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians."
"MS: Who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart, and we'll try to get you a microphone. MS: It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golfcart. How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin? And how many would not? How many say he doesn't?"
"Golf is an endurance sport, not a sport for the rich and famous, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: ""It's not about winning, it's about how you get there"" Sutter asks: ""What's the point of golf if you can't get there?"""
"The Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question. Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, said the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible. Scalia rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion."
"Justice Scalia: It's impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential. Scalia: If fairness were the only thing at stake, there would have been an easy and obvious solution. Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game, he says."
"Golf is a game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart. It would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer, the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes. It's hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions."

"When he was growing up in Botswana, Soweto was sent off to school by his father. His father worked for a non-governmental organization called IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation. He says the group's leader, Joshua Kangombe, saw what was happening: wildlife disappearing, poaching was skyrocketing."
"DNC has helped men reclaim their abilities to manage their peoples and their rights to own and manage wildlife. With independence, the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government. We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands; we needed to learn more things like GPS."
"Most poachers, like my father, were people from our own community. These were our own people. Once they were caught, they were treated with respect, brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams. Namibia has got 2.1 million people, but it is only twice the size of California."
"Namibia has the largest concentration of black rhino -- free-roaming black rhinos -- in the world. Namibia is now part of the global village. The natural plain has multiplied, like zebras, springboks and everything. The leopard is now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village."
"Namibia has 60 conservancies that manage and protect over 13 million hectares of land in Namibia. Conservancies are legally instituted institutions by the government, and these are run by the communities themselves. In 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars. Namibia's new economy is based on the respect of natural resources."

"Nuclear energy is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world. Nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site. Nuclear is down there with wind and hydro, below solar and way below fossil fuels."
"Chris Anderson: Wind, like solar, is a relatively dilute source of energy. Anderson: To get one gigawatt of electricity is on the order of 250 square miles of wind farm. He says solar, especially here in California, wants to bulldoze 1,000 square miles. Anderson says as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen."
"Ten percent of American electricity comes from decommissioned warheads. The new generation of reactors that are very small, down around 10 to 125 megawatts. They're incredibly safe, weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest. The governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive, and these will go ahead."
"Professor Mark Jacobson says nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide. Wind and concentrated solar have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph. Jacobson: Wind, solar, geothermal power, hydro-tidal wave power also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation."
"It takes between 10 and 19 years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation. While you're waiting around for your nuclear, you have to run the regular electric power grid, which is mostly coal. Nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times more CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy."
"Stewart Brand: Nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation. Brand: The footprint on the ground for wind is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world. He says you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet with 73,000 to 145,000 five-megawatt wind turbines."
"To power the entire world with 50 percent wind, you would need about one percent of world land. To power the U.S. vehicle fleet, to power cellulosic ethanol, this is how much land you'd need. With nuclear, you also have a buffer zone that's 17 square kilometers. With geothermal, it's even smaller."
"There's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world. Nuclear, the time lag alone will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more. We can guarantee a clean, blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power."
"There are 21 nations that have nuclear power, seven of which have nuclear weapons. The places that we would most like to have clean energy occur are China, India, Europe, North America. Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is."
"Rod Beckstrom is the CEO of ICANN. Beckstrom: Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa. ""The music there, the instruments, the intricate rhythms, the way it's played, the setting, it's all perfect,"" he says."
"In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect for the setting. The notes are long, there's almost no rhythm whatsoever, and the room flatters the music. The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification."
"Wagner wanted a little more bombast, so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there. People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built, they used to yell out to one another. The halls got bigger."
"The reverberation in Carnegie Hall meant that the music had to be less rhythmic and a little more textural. Popular music, coming along at the same time, was playing for dancers. Quiet parts could be heard that would be drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting."
"Microphones enabled singers, in particular, and musicians and composers, to completely change the kind of music that they were writing. Microphones allowed singers, like Frank Sinatra, to do things that they could never do without a microphone. People are dancing, shouting and drinking. The music has to be loud enough to be heard above that."
"There's live music, and there's recorded music. It's like the guy is sitting next to you, whispering who knows what into your ear. Live performance, when it was incredibly successful, ended up in what is probably, acoustically, the worst venues on the planet."
"U2 wrote what is now called arena rock, which is medium-speed ballads. Musicians who ended up there did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for. The music that, I would say, is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it."
"Birds in the canopy tend to have high-pitched, short and repetitive calls. The birds on the floor have lower pitched calls, so they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor. The music was in some ways different, but in structure and form, very much the same."
"""I think it's evolutionary. We already know where that passion is going,"" he says. ""The two, the passion and the joy, are not mutually exclusive,"" he adds. ""I think that's what we're going to have to work for in the future"""

"Skeptic magazine editor says we are pattern-seeking primates. We find patterns, we make connections, and that's called association learning, he says. He calls this process ""patternicity"" -- that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise."
"The problem is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a Type I error is less than the cost to make a Type II error. If you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made an error in cognition."
"Cognitive priming is a technique used to prime the brain to see patterns. The pattern detection device in the anterior cingulate cortex can be easily fooled. Some people see a Dalmatian dog, while others see a cow or a horse."
"Jennifer Whitson: People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this, which is allegedly patternless. In other words, the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control."
"Swiss psychologist Peter Brugger found more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere, via the left visual field, than the left hemisphere. Brugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr, gave subjects L-DOPA. An increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive dopamine."
"Dopamine changes our signal-to-noise ratio. If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors. If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas. It's a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates."
"What you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see. If we can give you conflicting data, again, your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive. The ADE 651 was sold to the Iraqi government for 40,000 dollars apiece."
"The illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns. Faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes. It's just like this one, completely worthless, in which it allegedly worked by ""electrostatic magnetic ion attraction"""
"The illusion was first done with Margaret Thatcher. The process agenticity is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning, intention and agency, often invisible beings from the top down. In a thought experiment, you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa. Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?"
"I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism. It's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us. The idea that government can rescue us -- that's no longer the wave of the future, but that is, I think, a type of agenticity."

"YouTube compares every video uploaded to the site to see if there's a match. The scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking. Most rights owners, instead of blocking, will allow the copy to be published. And then they benefit through the exposure, advertising and sales."
"The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence. The ""JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance"" became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of ""The Office"" It's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios, but sometimes big studios borrowing back."
"YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases. But the system only works through the participation of rights owners. Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, it's a complex web of relationships. By simply blocking all reuse, you'll miss out on new art forms, new audiences, new distribution channels."
"YouTube's Content ID system identifies when copyrighted material is uploaded to the site. A fan saw Chris Brown's ""Forever"" video on TV and uploaded it to YouTube. Within seconds of attempting to upload the video, the copy was detected, giving Sony the choice of what to do next."
The whales live in an amazing acoustic environment. They've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this. We need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities.
"Many mammals have to produce contact calls when, say, a mother and calf are apart. The signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch, each individual here has a radically different call. They can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls."
"When a male dolphin leaves Mom, it will often join up with another male and form an alliance, which may last for decades. As these two animals form a social bond, their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar. The average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes."
"CNN's John Sutter says we need to be more aware of the impact of noise in the ocean. Sutter: ""We need to make sure that we don't lose the sound of the ocean"" He says we should also be aware that the ocean is not the only place where noise is emitted."
"The ocean has properties that allow low-frequency sound to basically move globally. The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours. Blue whales and fin whales produce very low- frequencies that can travel over very long ranges. They form songs, and they appear to play a role in reproduction."
"Humpbacks make a sound that's a little higher in frequency, broader-band and more complicated. They can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient. This means that humpback song is a form of animal culture, just like music for humans would be."
"Listen to a recording made by Chris Clark, 0.2 miles away from a humpback. You can hear the full frequency range. You sound very nearby. The next recording you're going to hear was made of the same humpback song 50 miles away."
"The loudness of a whale call is louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers. Human ships are the main source of noise in the frequency range where whales communicate. If this signal is used for males and females to find each other and they're dispersed, imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations."
"Right whale mothers and calves use calls to stay in touch with one another. As we've put more noise into the oceans, these whales have had to shift. whales can compensate for noise by calling louder or by shifting their call out of the noise band. It's an amazing shift, induced by humans over this large scale."
"The International Maritime Organization of the United Nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships. If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull, you can reduce that noise by 99 percent. If this group can establish standards, and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships, we can now see a gradual decline in this potential problem."

"Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us: molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies. They go in the base of that pyramid, and they drift up; they're passed up that way, on to predators and on to the top predators, and in so doing, they accumulate."

"In a way, it's the story of my life. My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France. My uncle was a very prominent mathematician, and he told me, ""Look, there's a problem which I could not solve 25 years ago, and which nobody can solve"""
"The shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers, he says. The color was added for two reasons. The shapes are of such complication, such harmony and such beauty, he adds. The equation is hidden there, z goes into z squared, plus c."
"In 1990, he was in Cambridge, U.K. to receive a prize from the university. Three days later, a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing. The newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that ""discovery"" and received 5,000 letters."
"There are 49 million people and almost 16.7 million children who are hungry in America. The bigger problem that we all know about is obesity, and it's dramatic. Unfortunately, obesity's not only an American problem. It's actually been spreading around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems."
"I started out obsessed with global security policy, because I lived in New York during 9/11. The foods that are produced are, more or less, corn, soy and wheat. Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers. I think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides."
"A fifth of kids under two drinks soda, because it's so cheap. The U.S. food system is affecting both hunger and obesity, he says. ""It's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it,"" he says of the global food system."
"2010 is the 30th anniversary of the U.N. World Food Programme. The 30 Project is focused on long-term ideas for food system change. ""We know what's happened in the past, so if we start now, we might be able to recreate the food system"""
The 30Project.org is a coalition of organizations aiming to change the world's food system. The group's first project is selling a bag of school meals for a year. The idea is to get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger.
"The U.S. has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women. Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released, 60 will return to prison. ""Trees are rooted in the ground for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, they become very dynamic"""
"Inmates are kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day. They're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards one hour a day for one hour. This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months. He's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him more serene."
"Since 1960, four billion people have been added to the world population. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, and they have become emerging economies, we call them."
"The world's two billion poorest people are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago. The world's three billion richest people are becoming emerging economies. The distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever. This is the new world we have today in 2010."
"Among emerging economies, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end. The poorest two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening."
"Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good, he says. ""We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things,"" says Gates. ""The only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent"""
"""I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious ""possibilist,"" he says. ""It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth,"" he adds. ""The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world"""
"In 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. In the developing world, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. Even Thomas Jefferson complained that corporations were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country."
The first offshore wells were called whales. We're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy. The Glass-Steagall Act was put in effect in 1933. We've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling. We can't have clean energy because it's too expensive.
"Oceans are getting more acidified, and already affecting animals. Coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem. Energy is always a moral issue. It's an issue that is moral right now. It is a matter of right and wrong."
"""I'm very much haunted by it. And I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times, I really kind of am traumatized,"" he says. ""It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car, and you just dumped it in the ocean"""

"Rep. Markey: ""I confirmed the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix ... until you add a dispersant"" ""I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body, because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene,"" Markey says."
"The oil is concentrated at the surface, and then it is attacked, because they don't want the evidence. Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish. These guys have to swim around through it. A guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings."
"In the Exxon Valdez spill, about 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months. The recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable. It's going to take longer for some things to come back. And some things, I think, will probably come back a little faster."
"I don't know if it'll affect the adults. If it's not, it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae. We've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean, for a very long time. It's not like we're starting with something that's been OK."
"CNN's John Defterios: ""This is one of the most absolutely mind-boggling examples of total unpreparedness that I can even think of"" ""The biological effects are certainly hemispheric,"" he says. ""We just seem to be unable to figure out what to do"""
"""It's just ridiculous. You can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the birds,"" he says. ""I don't mean to cast any aspersion on people. It's really, really important that we express our compassion"""

The human hand and the computer mouse are both made of the same material. They were both made to fit the human hand. The human hand has evolved over millions of years. The computer mouse was made to work on computers. It is not the same thing as a computer.
"I think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world. My body's an accumulation of ideas too. The idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells and liver cells. They've come together. Evolution uses sexual reproduction. It's not confined to its own lineage."
"The exchange of one object for another never happens. It's a unique human feature. No other animal does it. You can have, as it were, asexual culture. Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture. But the difference is that these cultures never expand."
"Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam. Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to making an axe. If Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes, and then they trade, they will each have saved an hour of work."
"In 1800, you'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour. In 1880, it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage. Back in 1950, you would have to work for eight seconds to acquire that much light. That's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since 1950."
"In his lifetime, the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet, in real terms, adjusted for inflation, has tripled. In the old days, if you were rich, you literally had people working for you. That's how you got to be rich; you employed them."
"There's a division of labor between males and females in hunter-gatherer societies. The reason is that reproduction is the one thing we don't do for ourselves. The beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides. It's not always that simple, however."
" Neanderthals were a highly intelligent species. Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine in this room today. They were imaginative. They buried their dead. They had language, probably, because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us."
"Trade between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years. The earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa. Long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade, not migration. Trade is 10 times as old as farming. People think of trade as a modern thing."
"When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago, the people on it experienced slower progress than people on the mainland. The population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had."
"We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree. We've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand. It's the interchange of ideas, the meeting and mating of ideas between them, that is causing technological progress."
"Erik Hersman is a well-known American geek, but he's also Kenyan. He was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya. He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds, he says. The good news about this is that the global community is pitching in to help out, Hersman says."

"On any day you can go into Trending Topics, you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African-American conversations. ""This wasn't how the internet was supposed to be,"" says CNN's Jarrett Bellini. Bellini: We end up within these filter bubbles, where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to us."
"It's very difficult for me to get Fijian news, which is strange, because there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji. The economy of moving these heavy, slow atoms over long distances is very difficult to do. We're heading to the future of bits, where everything is speedy and weightless."
"The world is not as flat as we think it is, says CNN's John Defterios. There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected, he says. But there are also areas that are systematically cut off, he adds."
"In the 1970s, 35 to 40 percent of U.S. TV news was international news. That's down to about 12 to 15 percent now. This tends to give us a very distorted view of the world, he says. ""The world is, in fact, getting more global. It's getting more connected,"" he adds. ""And our media is less global by the day"""
"New media isn't necessarily helping us all that much, says TED Talk host. Even within Wikipedias, there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based. In the U.K., you can pick up your computer and read a newspaper from India or Australia."

"CNN's John Defterios writes about the dangers of living in a cultural cocoon. He says that if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted, then we too run the risk of drying up inside. Defterio: One way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling."

"In the face of death and destruction, our mundane differences evaporated, and we all became one even if for a few hours. I'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile -- they ask me why I do this -- but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself. I love writing in Turkish, which to me is very poetic and very emotional, and I loveWriting in English is very mathematical and cerebral."
"The author grew up in a patriarchal environment in Arizona. She says she has always been a nomad, physically and spiritually. Her grandmother told her to get married so she could settle down once and for all. But instead of settling down, she went to Arizona and started commuting between Istanbul and Arizona."
"Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own, but as the representatives of their respective cultures. Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily. When identity politics tries to put labels on us, it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger."

"WikiLeaks has released more classified documents than the rest of the world's media combined, says Julian Assange. The WikiLeaks founder says the release of a report on corruption in Kenya changed the election. The report was commissioned by a coalition of forces trying to clean up corruption in the country. Assange says the report became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck."
Julian Assange: It's a worry -- isn't it? -- that the rest of the world's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information. Assange: We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story.
"Between 18 and 26 people were killed all together. Two Reuters employees, two young children were wounded. Two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full-time job. If you look at declassified cables, that's the sort of material that's there."

"As a psychologist, I worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world. I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership, only to end up being tortured by their heroes. And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero, that just breaks you in so many ways."

"Nicolaus Copernicus' followers asked if the Earth is just a planet, then what about planets around other stars? DNA match was unambiguous, and we know that this was indeed NicolausCopernicus. And here begins 400 years of frustration, of unfulfilled dreams."
"The Kepler telescope is designed to find planets that orbit other stars. It uses a method called the transit method, which occurs when a planet passes in front of its star. If you look straight up and place your palm like this, you can see the field of the sky for four years."
"Up until recently, that was the Solar System -- four Earth-like planets with small radius, smaller than about two times the size of the Earth. The Copernican Revolution brought in telescopes, and of course three more planets were discovered. Now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets."
"""We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there,"" says astronomer. ""Now for the first time, we can say that. There is a lot more work we need to do with this,"" he says.

"The biosphere is the size of the Earth. The Earth is very small in space. Life on Earth is theSize of the observable universe. The size of a single, small atom. It is unimaginably small. We can't imagine it. We know that."
"The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain. To increase the area that's available for mental capacity, the brain surface is highly folded. The breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex, so that we can map the signals closer to its source."
"It doesn't require any scalp preparation, no conductive gel or paste. It's also wireless, so it gives you the freedom to move around. And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system, this headset only costs a few hundred dollars."
"Communication between people is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed. The idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen, and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that."
"The technology can also be applied to real world applications -- in this example, a smart home. In games and virtual worlds, for example, your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character. In this case, flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking ""lift"" with your mind."
"Computer can use facial expressions to control an electric wheelchair. Brain is made up of billions of active neurons, around 170,000 km of combined axon length. Computer can understand not only what you direct it to do, but it can also respond to your facial expressions."

"The ""gal stripping"" technique is an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus. The procedure has been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases. The next step is a total biologic knee replacement, not just the parts."
"Super biologics is coming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe. We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts. We can use thicker, younger, better tissues than you might have injured in your knee. This is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global."
"In the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body, shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way? Let's consider an alternative path. What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature, or within our own stem cells?"
"Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice, believing that they will be, or ought to be, welcomed with open hearts and minds. The phantasmagoria, the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative, varies from place to place. Robert Frost once said that, ""It is poetry that is lost in translation"""
"Sheena Iyengar: ""If we learn to speak to one another, then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness, complexity and compelling beauty"" ""From my American perspective, when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences, she has every right to have that request met"""
"""The American way"" is to ""have it your way"" says the author of ""The Art of War"" ""The art of war"" is the art of making people feel good about themselves. The art of the war is to make people feel better about themselves, the author says."
"Americans tend to believe that they've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice. Unfortunately, these beliefs are based on assumptions that don't always hold true in many countries, in many cultures. I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them."
"In one study, Anglo-Americans did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them. Asian-American children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice. The first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice."
"The American view of choice requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act. The assumption that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others. When, in contrast, two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected, they may amplify one another's success."
"CNN's John Sutter interviewed people in formerly communist countries. One of the most interesting revelations came from a simple gesture of hospitality. Sutter: People perceived seven different sodas as one choice: soda or no soda. For modern Americans, choice is as much about who they are as it is about what the product is."
"The value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options. Americans train their whole lives to play ""spot the difference"" Americans practice this from such an early age that they've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability."
"Americans are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice. A number of studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options, they make poorer decisions. Many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them."
"In France, the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed, while in the United States, the final decision rested with the parents. American parents were more likely to express negative emotions, as compared to their French counterparts. The power of grid computing is going to be just amazing here."
"Within five to seven years, I see us having a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean. Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation. We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning, and it would be on live TV."
"Sylvia Pinto: ""If we would know the oceans, we must go to the oceans"" Pinto says the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth. She says there are bold, new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. ""It's going to be amazing,"" she says."
"Scientists are trying to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes. One is solar, that drives the winds, the waves, the clouds, the storms and photosynthesis. The second is internal energy, which war against one another almost continuously."
"Oceans are the crucible out of which life on the planet came, he says. ""It's now time for us to understand it. We must understand it,"" he adds. ""There's an urgency to this. Part of the urgency comes from the fact that a billion people currently are undernourished or starving"""
"Oceans control or at least significantly influence, the growth patterns and the drought patterns on the continents. The age of the ocean, the tectonic plates, gives rise to a totally new phenomenon. Deep below the sea floor, there is vast reservoir of microbial activity, which we have only just discovered."
"The National Science Foundation has begun to fund the Ocean Observatory Initiative. The program involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image. The OOI has the potential to really transform things, says Dr. John Basho."
"The goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across and within the ocean basins, utilizing widely accessible, interactive telepresence. We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean, at will, communicating in real time."
"The system will deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume. It'll be, in a sense, like having time on a telescope, except you'll have your own port. Climate change, ocean acidification, dissolved oxygen, carbon cycle, coastal upwelling, fishing dynamics will be addressed."
"There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore, all available to anyone who has any interest in using it. The bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to 10 stereo HD systems running continuously and, again, directed through robotic techniques from land."
"CNN's John Defterios meets with scientists from around the world to talk about the future of the ocean. Defterio: ""We will know, not just the physics and the chemistry, but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us"""
CNN's John Sutter: Bias might be a deeper part of us than we think. He says it may be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history. Sutter says the biases that lead investors to do badly are going to be hard to overcome.
"""We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations,"" he says. ""But we have to recognize that we have those limitations"" ""That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential,"" he adds."
"Human error is a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature. How is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time? In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from? I see a couple different possibilities."
"Holly, a brown capuchin monkey, is very smart, but lacks some of the things we think might be messing us up. We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it. The good news is that Holly doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do."
"The first unit that I know of of non-human currency is actually the first unit I've ever seen. We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies, so we just called it a token. We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly, see if she messes these things up."
"Monkeys at Yale are taught to use currency to buy food. The currency is just a piece of metal, but the monkeys can trade it for food. One of the monkeys, Mayday, trades a coin for some food. She is shown waiting for her food."
"""We just allowed them to pick this up on their own. So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart. They're surprisingly good at this with very little training"" ""It was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets"""
"Researchers used monkeys to test the value of a single token in a market. They found that the monkeys paid attention to how much they got for their tokens. The monkeys' data matched what they saw humans doing in a real market, the researchers say."
"CNN's John Sutter and a group of monkeys are playing a game of Monopoly. They're trying to see if they can get the game to work. Sutter: ""Let's see if we can get them to do the things that we can't"""
"Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option. If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more. Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure? Most people are a little risk-averse."
"When presented with options, people don't choose to play it safe. They actually tend to go a little risky. The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice. But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with."
The idea is that we really hate it when we have to lose money. And so this is what we did. We gave the monkeys choices. They did the same thing every time. And then we gave them options that were more risky. And that's what happened.
"Monkeys choose exactly the same way as people, when tested in the same thing. Qualitatively and quantitatively, they choose the same as people. The monkeys get no bonus if they get a bonus of zero. Sometimes the monkeys get two extra for a big bonus."
"Monkeys are given a choice: play it safe and get two grapes every time, or take a risky bet and choose between one and three. The risky bets become more risky depending on how the experimenters started out. This suggests that the monkeys too are treating losses differently than they treat gains."
"CNN's John Defterios goes to the top of Mt. Everest for the first time. He says it's a tough climb, but the view from the top is incredible. Defterio: ""It's like you're standing on the edge of a cliff and you're looking down"""
"""I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening,"" he says. ""When you're trying to do that, and then the bodies are coming past you, it humbles you"" ""I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible,"" he adds."
"The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade, or 29 degrees Fahrenheit. The water is completely black. It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have. I got myself to the side of the lake. My crew grabbed me, and then we walked as quickly as we could down."
"Climate change is the ""Mt. Everest of all problems,"" says President Barack Obama. Obama: ""Just because something has worked in the past so well, doesn't mean it's going to work in the future"" ""What radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment?"" he asks."
Coconut farmers can produce 320 percent as much cocoa on 40 percent of the land. The price of food is going down because consumers are not paying for the true cost of food. Coca-Cola is entering into 17-year contracts with growers in Turkey to sell juice into Europe.
"We need to take what we've learned in private, voluntary standards and use that to inform government regulation. We can't just focus on identifying the best; we've got to move the rest of the way. These companies have begun to think differently. They're on a journey; there's no turning back."
"I grew up on a small farm in Missouri. We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent of the global Brazil-nut market. We paid two to three times more than anybody else. We lived on less than a dollar a day for about 15 years. We were attacking the wrong driver. We needed to be working on soy."
"""We've got to wake up to the fact that we don't have any more and that this is a finite planet"" ""We may have some innovative, new ideas. But in general, this is what we've got. There's a basic equation that we can't get away from"""
"In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet. Now we're at 1.3. The average cat in Europe has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average African. If we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed. For bankers, we would be living off the principal."
"By 2050, we're going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree. They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do. Income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today. We need to use less to make more, then use less again."
"The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S., 3.5 seconds in Europe. Do organic potatoes actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes? In every single case, the answer is ""it depends"" on who produced it and how."
Sustainability has got to be something we all care about. We need groups to work together that never have. We've identified 35 places globally that we need to work. These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point of view.
"Up to 500 companies control 70 percent or more of the trade of each of the 15 commodities that we've identified as the most significant. If we work with those, if we change those companies and the way they do business, then the rest will happen automatically."
"100 companies control 25 percent of the trade of all 15 of the most significant commodities on the planet. If these companies demand sustainable products, they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production. After 40 years, the global organic movement has achieved 0.7 of one percent of global food."
"In salmon aquaculture, we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago. We eventually got, I think, 60 percent of global production at the table and 25 percent of demand. Next week, we launch globally verified, vetted and certified standards for salmon Aquaculture."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on this project for two years. He says it's a good way to get the word out about climate change. Defterio: ""We need to make sure that people are aware of what's going on in the world"""
Chocolate giant Mars has made sustainability pledges to buy only certified product for all of its seafood. Mars is sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant to improve chocolate production. Mars buys more seafood than Walmart because of pet food. Mars wants to be in business in the future.
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the need to address gender inequity. Sutter: ""The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages"" ""We have all won the lottery of life. And so the question becomes: how do we discharge that responsibility?"""
"TED speaker: The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender. In Europe and the West, when women and men have equal access to food and health care, there are more women, he says. But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case."
"In India, from one to five, girls die at a 50 percent higher rate than boys. When you educate a boy, his family tends to have fewer kids. The second reason is it has to do with spending. In India, two percent of the income is spent on education."
"Dai Manju: 20 percent of Saudi Arabia's economy is made up of alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks, prostitution and festivals. Manju says women need to be part of the solution, not the problem. ""It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju,"" she says."
"There are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders. A slave back then is worth about $40,000 in today's money. In Niger, one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth. One woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth."
"Dai Manju was married against her will at age 13. She got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby, and she ended up with a fistula. The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her."
"Mahabuba is saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of women in Pakistan. She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. Mahabuba: When you educate a girl, she tends to get married later on in life, have fewer kids, and educate them in a more enlightened fashion."
"Dai Manju's parents pulled her out of school because the fees were too much. Dai Manju started an embroidery business and hired other women in the village. She now has three daughters, all of whom are being tutored in education. Larry Summers says the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls' education."
"Beatrice was the first person in her village, ever, to come to the U.S. on scholarship. ""I am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat,"" she said on the day of her college graduation. ""This is what happens to girls in remote areas. It isn't easy"""
"Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade. He says individuals can make a difference, and they should. A movement of men and women is what's needed to bring about social change, he says. ""We think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater; you actually improve"""
"The game uses Kinect technology to let users interact with a virtual character. The character, Milo, uses his hand, body and voice, just like humans do. There are no controllers, no keyboards, or mice, or joysticks or joypads. Milo's parents are too busy to listen to his problems."
"The video was created using a combination of human and AI technology. The camera is able to match a person's face to the shape of their body to create the illusion that they are standing in a garden. The video was filmed over a series of days in Timbuktu, in northern Mali."
"Peter Molyneux: Do you want Milo to squash it? Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important, but remember, even this choice will affect how Milo develops. PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do."
"Milo's parents had asked him to clean up his room, so they decided to teach him how to throw a stone. ""It's very, very interesting that men, more than women, tend to be more competitive here,"" he says. ""You stand up, and you skim the stone. It's that simple"""
"You can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents. We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part, you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo. And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy."
"Milo's mind is based in a cloud of computing power. As you interact with him, you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects. That means Milo's mind, as millions of people use it, will get smarter and cleverer."
"Milo Yiannopoulos is the creator of a new computer game called ""Berfect"" The game is the brainchild of a former head of original content for a Western TV network in Dubai. It is the first time he has worked on a computer game in the Middle East. He says the game is about ""righting writing wrongs"" in the region."
"The Middle East is huge, and with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh. The Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special that aired in the States, and it was getting great hits on YouTube. The earth rotated, as did our management, and as if by divine intervention, things came together."
"CNN's John Defterios has been in the Middle East for more than a year. He says the region needs to find a way to celebrate its differences. Defterio: ""We need to take our responsibilities seriously, but not ourselves"""
"The first all-women's stand-up show was held in Dubai earlier this month. Comedians from Kuwait, Syria, Egypt and Lebanon have been performing in the Middle East. ""We are doing our best to change our image, and it's exploding,"" says Nasser."
"Dean Obeidallah says the Middle East has a positive story to tell and image to sell. He says there are wrongs that need to be righted in the media portrayal of the region. ""We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel,"" he says."
"Iranian-born comedian says stand-up comedy in the Middle East is a ""stand-up uprising"" ""As my father likes to call him, ""Asheikh Azubare;"" as my mother would say, ""Shakespeare"" ""I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either,"" he says."
"Iranian-American actor Mazan Gorani was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour. Gorani: A lot of times in Hollywood, when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent, they go, ""Oh, you're Iranian. Great! Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah?'"" Gorani says he doesn't mind playing bad guys, he just wants to rob a bank."
"""There's good people everywhere,"" he says. ""All it takes in one person to mess it up"" ""As a Middle-Eastern male, when you show up around a lot of these activities, you start feeling guilty"" ""We just want to say: we tried,"" he adds."

"In Dubai, they sell frozen yogurt by the gram, like a drug deal. ""There's a recession going on, even in Dubai, but you wouldn't know by the prices,"" he says. ""A lot of times when they build stuff, there are no rules and regulations,"" he adds."
"The comedian says he tries to break stereotypes in his stand-up. He says he has been guilty of stereotyping in the Middle East. ""Part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program, the other part thinks I can't be trusted with one"""
"Jamal Bond: I try, with my stand-up, to break stereotypes, present Middle Easterners and Muslims in a positive light. ""I was born in Iran; I'm now an American citizen, which means I have the American passport,"" he says. ""Who knows? Maybe one day, we'll even have our own James Bond,"" he adds."
"Seth Priebatsch: ""There's a game layer on top of the world, and it's very important that we build it properly"" ""I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR. I'm trying to go places. I like it quite a lot,"" he says."
"The social layer of the web is about connections. The game layer is all about influence. The more consciously we think about this, the better we'll be able to use it for anything we want. The resources are mindshare, and the tools, the raw materials, are game dynamics."
"The most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called, ""Happy Hour"" It's a dynamic in which to succeed, players have to do something at a predefined time. It also exists in more conventional game forms, such as Farmville. The next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built."
"Farmville has more active users than Twitter. It has a dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your fake crops, or they wilt. This is so powerful that when they tweak their stats, when they say your crops wilt, it changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day."
"This is one of the most famous game dynamics, used all over the place. It's also used in more conventional settings, and can be used more consciously there. School is a game; it's just not a terribly well-designed game."
"The progression dynamic is used all over the place, including LinkedIn, where I am an unwhole individual. The average player spends some six, six-and-a-half hours a day on it. World of Warcraft is one of the most successful games of all time."
"Progression is powerful. It can also be used in very compelling ways for good. We have a game that people play. They go places, do challenges, earn points. And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it. This is powerful enough that we can see it pulls people back to the same local businesses."
"The game is also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly, where the game is not the Monopoly you're playing, but the cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk. The game became more powerful than the goal. The winner was a group out of MIT, where they created sort of a pyramid scheme."
"CNN's John Sutter says visualizing information can be a quick solution to problems. Sutter: ""I find information just too interesting. It has a magnetic quality that draws me in"" ""The tools, the resources that we use to build a game layer, are game dynamics themselves"""
"CNN's John Defterios creates an information map of the world's fears. The map is a timeline of global media panic. Defterio: ""We need to imagine what a landscape of theworld's fears might look like"" He says the map can be used to explore the world with your eyes rather than your brain."
"The intensity of certain fears as reported in the media as reported by the media is shown in the chart. The data shows the intensity of some of the world's most common fears, such as swine flu, SARS, killer wasps and asteroid collisions. But there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it."
"In April 1999 was the Columbine shooting, and since then, that fear has been remembered by the media. Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights, and it's all around us. But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way, interesting things can appear."
"People clearing out for Spring Break, then the lowest day of the year: Christmas Day. This is the $Billion Dollar o-Gram, and this image arose out of frustration I had with the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press.

"The U.S. has the biggest military budget in the world, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: America is so rich that it can contain all the other top industrialized nations' economies inside itself. To change the picture, Sutter brings in another data set, GDP, or country's earnings."
"China has the most soldiers in the world, but it has a tiny army when you take other data into consideration. U.S. drops to 124th. American drops into eighth. The colors here represent the motivation behind the money. So purple is ""fighting,"" and red is ""giving money away,"" and green is ""profiteering"""
"This is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements. The higher up the image, the more evidence there is for each supplement. The bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits. It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space."
"The app is generating itself from the data. The data is all stored in a Google Doc, and it's literally generating itself. New evidence comes out. The image recreates itself. It's kind of living. But it can go beyond numbers. It explores our worldviews."
"This is OPEC's revenue, this green box here -- 780 billion a year. This past May was the warmest worldwide on record. And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too. So that's what's exciting to me, seeing how data can change my perspective."
"Under the surface is a hive of industrial activity centered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly. The drill plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis. The ice formed as snow 15,800 years ago, when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet."
"Each storm scours the atmosphere, washing out dust, soot, trace chemicals, and depositing them on the snow pack. Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air, a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases. The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level, beneath its weight."
"The ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change. It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures. So far, they've packed up about 4,500 feet of ice cores for shipment back to the United States. The 109th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back."
"The WAIS Divide is the best place on the planet, many say, to study the history of climate change. There, scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future. ""I saw grottoes and secret gardens and places I'd love to hide as a kid,"" he says."
"Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character, I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier. The differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science-fiction movie. The particles in the water make it look like it's floating in outer space."

"With Sherman, a great white shark, I didn't want to go with this ruthless predator image. He's kind of just out there making a living. I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne, who doesn't get a lot of respect. And then I'll introduce you to one more character, Ernest, who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body."
"The cartoonist has taken readers to the Sea of Japan and the kelp forests of California. ""I feel like, if in a day, I can see the ocean differently, then I can evoke that same kind of change in others, especially kids,"" he says."
"CNN's John Sutter has been working on a new series, ""Shark Tank,"" since last year. The series follows the story of a man who loses his life in a shark attack. Sutter says the series is about the waste of human life."
"The strip explores the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue. ""I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years. Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean,"" he says. ""This is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time"""
"""I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue,"" he says. ""There's been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean, mostly negative,"" he adds. ""I'd like to end with a little metaphor here"""
"""Mission Blue"" is a comic strip about people of the hydrocarbon. ""We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules"" ""We could actually reduce our gasoline consumption -- or our oil consumption -- by 20 percent"""
"The chemistry of oil in water makes it so disastrous. Oil doesn't sink, it floats. Oil spreads out to be really thin, so you have a hard time corralling it. When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics, it's absolutely explosive."
"Most Americans feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy, not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market. Many gas pumps, including this one, are designed to look like ATMs. That's specifically to diffuse our anger, because supposedly we feel good about ATMs, he says."
"In the U.S., the politics of oil are very moral in the United States. The oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus of engineering and finance. In the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing, long before it became funny."
"CNN's John Sutter looks back at the history of the oil industry. Sutter: ""We've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs"" The oil industry is ""a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA,"" Sutter says."
"The Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969 started the modern environmental movement. ""We look at these pictures and we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain"" ""We have this kind of -- as voters, we have kind of a ""eureka!"" moment"""
Nigeria has had thousands of oil spills a year since 1969. U.S. has two percent of the world's oil reserves; 65 percent are in the Persian Gulf. The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices.
"The U.S. taxpayer paid for a big oil project in Chad, with Exxon and the World Bank. But at the same time, Chad has become much more unstable, and we are not paying for that price at the pump. The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil is the Gulf of Mexico."
"Gulf has about 50 percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well. American families also pay a price for oil. Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy, but they're also a drain on individual families."
"The U.S. needs to focus on reducing the waste in the oil industry, says economist. ""We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil,"" he says. ""It's time to change the way we think about the use of oil"""
The U.S. needs to reduce its dependence on oil. A new tax on oil would help raise the money needed to do so. The tax would start at three cents a gallon and go up to 30 cents by 2020. It would also provide a way for people to get help if they need it.
"The bigger a brand is, the more difficult it is to reposition. The act of measuring a particle changes the way it is perceived by the observer. This is why it is so difficult to measure the speed of light. The speed of sound is also affected by the size of the sound wave."
"Physicists say you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it. The marketing message is to measure what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they will do. With better point-of-sale tracking, more digital media consumption, we can measure more what consumers do."
"The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system, will always increase. With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer, it's impossible to control where it goes. This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people."
"Newton's Law: ""The force equals mass times acceleration"" The more massive a brand, the more force is needed to change its positioning. It's part of the fight and flight mechanism, that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer."
"Environmentalists need to start thinking about what progress is, says climate change campaigner. The only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition, he says. In the Western world, we have enough, he adds."

The New Economics Foundation has created the Happy Planet Index. The index is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use. The ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
"The graph is like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy. It's like quality and quantity of life in nations. There are some countries up there, yellow triangles, that are doing better than global average. Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph, are countries that are not producing much well-being."
"Costa Rica is the happiest place in the world, according to a new poll. The country has one of the highest life expectancy at 78 years old. It is expected to be carbon neutral by the end of the 20th century. The U.S. has the lowest life expectancy in the developed world at 50 years."
"The challenge, really, is to pull the global average up here. That's what we need to do. And then we're starting to create a happy planet. We don't have good data going back for every country in the world, but for some of the richest countries."
"Climate change skeptics and deniers want quality of life to keep increasing, he says. ""None of us, I think, want human progress to stop,"" he adds. ""That is changing our business. That is changing the way we create our organizations, we do our government policy"""
"We need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being. We need to focus on the best-case scenario, rather than the worst-case. What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier? We did a project for the Government Office of Science."
"Social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life, says Dr. David Perry. The fastest way out of a bad mood: step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance, he says. Older people who keep learning and are curious have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down."
"Human beings want to be happy. They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied. We've used fear, if you like, to grab people's attention. We feel good if we give. And the final one is that most anti-economic of activities, but give."
We are in the only period in the history of the planet that can support human development. We need to move away from a situation where we are pushing ourselves into a dark future. And we need to create a world where happiness does not cost the earth.
"We live on a human-dominated planet, putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth. The majority of the planet, aspiring for development, are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle. Never have we seen, in the past 50 years, such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services."
"We may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet. The planetary risks we're facing are so large, that business as usual is not an option. A trigger and the system tips over, loses its resilience, soft corals take over."
"30 or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time, ""Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?"" The scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds in the paleo-record of the history of the planet. This work, which was published in ""Nature,"" late 2009, led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries."
"Climate change and biodiversity loss are the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity. Human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole. The drama is, of course, is that 200 countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction."
"Governance and management needs to be more flexible and adaptive, he says. We have to invest in persistence, in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup. The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story, he adds."
"We need nothing less than a new green revolution, says climate scientist. We cannot continue consuming water as we do today, he says. Even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems can be improved. We need to invest in trust, local, action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations."
"His Holiness the Karmapa: We often miss the very subtle changes in our lives.

"TD: When I was seven years old, all of a sudden, a search party arrived at my home. The news came to me that they were telling me that I was the Karmapa. I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with."
"TD: I talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone. With every second that passes during our conversation, the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together. I think that's symbolic of what we're seeing in the world in general, that the world is becoming smaller."
"TD: I think that, in this way, it's always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better. The development that we make shouldn't create a further burden for us as human beings, but should be used to improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we live in the world."
"Psychologists have found that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. The mind is tricked into feeling that it's already done. Because you've felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology, called this ""substitution"""
"Wera Mahler was inspired by her interest in art, science and philosophy to write a book about Greenland's 3,000-year-old map lichen. The project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences. Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north."
"The Armillaria is known as the ""humongous fungus"" and is one of the world's largest organisms. It is known to kill trees by blocking the flow of water and nutrients. CNN's John Defterios chartered a plane to search for the death rings."
"This is clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah, that is literally 80,000 years old. The location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection. This is the spruce Gran Picea, which at 9,550 years is a mere babe in the woods."
"The world's oldest living tree is a 2,000-year-old Baobab tree in South Africa. The tree is one of the oldest in the world and dates back more than 3,000 years. The oldest living creature is a giant clam that was found in Iceland. It is thought to be the oldest living organism."
The Welwitschia is a tree that lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola. It's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea. It also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom. The project is part art and part science.
"A tree called Jomon Sugi, living on the remote island of Yakushima, is around 2,000 years old. Back in the U.S., there's a couple plants of similar age. These also tend to grow clonally, the oldest of which is 13,000."
"The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past, a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future. They've survived for millennia in desert, in the permafrost, at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working with children in developing countries to teach them how to use computers and the internet. He says children can learn to use the internet on their own, irrespective of who or where they are. Defterio: We need 100 million mediators -- there are many more than that on the planet -- 10 million SOLEs, 180 billion dollars and 10 years."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to South Africa to meet children who had lost their English teachers. The children were able to learn English by listening to their parents' conversations. Defterius: ""I think it's a good idea for children to learn how to speak English"""
"In 2006, a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India. At the end of the next four years, I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own. So in 2006, I moved to Newcastle."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working with children in India to teach them about DNA. The children were given a computer program and asked to test their knowledge of it. The results showed that the children had little or no knowledge of the program. Defterio: ""We have an ironic problem."
"It took me three years to publish that. It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology. One of the referees who refereed the paper said, ""It's too good to be true,"" which was not very nice. I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment."
"The method is based on embedding a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi. In Gateshead, the children use Google, Wikipedia and Ask Jeeves to solve questions. The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes. The worst, in 45."
"The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English, and they'd never seen a computer before. The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent. There was photographic recall inside the children, I suspect because they're discussing with each other."
"The SOLE is designed so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens, big connections, but in groups. The mediator is from Pune, India. The furniture is designed to look like a 'granny cloud'"

Oceans have evolved with CO2 levels lower than they are today. That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification. It's not clear what the target should be for limiting CO2 emissions.
"From an oceanic perspective, 450 is way too high. There's compelling evidence that it really needs to be 350. We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450, so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the role of carbon dioxide in climate change. Sutter: ""We can't solve the problem of climate change without changing the way we think about it"" He says it's not just CO2, it's also methane, nitrate, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide."
"CNN's John Defterios travels to the Antarctic to learn more about climate change. He visits a research vessel that has been drilling into the sea bed. Defterio: ""This is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm"""
"The Ross Sea Ice Shelf is partly floating, exposed to the ocean. When that ice melts, sea level rises by six meters. Scientists drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through 900 meters of water and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor."
"The Ross Sea region, this ice shelf, melted back and formed anew about 35 times in the past four million years. Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic. The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago, and it's been there ever since."
"CNN's John Defterios reports from the Galapagos Islands on the effects of ocean acidification. Defterio: ""We do expect to see a sea-level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century"" ""We've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount,"" he says."
"In 1982-'83, that El Nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. Then there was similar mortality in '97-'98. And what we found after drilling back in time two to 400 years was that these were unique events."
"The Galapagos Islands are home to one of the world's largest coral reefs. The coral was growing happily in those shallow waters, until 1954, when an earthquake happened. Researchers have now been able to analyze the temperature of the ancient ocean using coral cores."
"The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years. The coral is instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water. Researchers can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral, and there's a whole bunch of things we can do."
Scientists are looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet. Each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals. Some of the records show lower temperatures than others. But they all tell us what the natural variability is. The planet was cooling down until about 1900.
"CNN's John Defterios looks at the instrumental temperature record for the last century. He says there's nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we've seen in the past century. Defterio: We're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere, from fossil fuels, from cement production."
"At some point, as this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues, that material's actually going to start to dissolve. There's many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean. Christopher Makau is a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown."

"""Crowd-accelerated innovation"" is the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call ""crowded innovation"" The bigger the crowd, the more potential innovators there are. ""You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn"""
"The dance community is now global. There's millions connected. And amazingly, you can still see what the best can do. The crowd itself shines a light on them, either directly, through comments, ratings, email, Facebook, Twitter, or indirectly, through links."
"Crowds are self-fueling. It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire. The dark side of the web is allergic to the light. You can publish your stuff online. And even if it's not that eloquent, it can still make your day."
"TEDx founder: ""We're a social species. We spark off each other. We are learning from them"" TEDx has opened up its talks to the world, and millions of people are helping spread speakers' ideas, he says. ""The wheel is turning,"" he adds."
"TED Talk: The significance of the rise of online video. TED Talk: This is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally.

"TED is dreaming of ways to make it easier for you, the global TED community, to respond to speakers, to contribute your own ideas, maybe even your own TEDTalks. If we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool, this wheel turns."
Sally Kohn: We're about to start a new era of social science. She says we'll be able to use data to predict and prevent epidemics. Kohn says we can use this data to improve health and well-being for all.
"Inventor of the theory of social contagion explains how ideas and behaviors spread through social networks. The diffusion-of-innovation curve can be understood by looking at a network of 105 people. The dots are the people, and the lines represent friendship relationships."
"Nicholas Christakis: Not all positions in the network are the same. He says sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties. Christakis asks audience: Who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network, A or B? He says A is more central, and this can be formalized mathematically."
"Mapping human social networks is not always possible. It can be expensive, not feasible, unethical, or, frankly, just not possible to do such a thing. How can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network? And you get a network that looks like this."
"Every dot is a person. Your friends have more friends than you do, and this is known as the friendship paradox. The friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree, and are more central than the random people themselves. The researchers tested this idea with an outbreak of H1N1 flu at Harvard College."
"Using this technique, we could get more than a month-and-a-half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population. The first evidence you saw of a blip above zero in adoption of the innovation would be evidence of an impending epidemic. Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged, as shown on the left."
"Using a visualization of the flu, the size of the dots is proportional to how many of your friends have the flu. The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now, in November. The same insights can also be exploited in other ways, for example, in the use of targeting specific people."
"If we have a population of a thousand people, and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen, we don't have to immunize every single person. If we immunize 960 of them, it's as if we had immunized a hundred [percent] of them. Similar ideas can be used to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world."
"We are in the era of what I would call ""massive-passive"" data collection efforts. These new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom, but where everyone is. We can monitor purchasing behavior in people and watch how these types of phenomena can diffuse within human populations."
"The hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music, including dance. It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe. It takes anywhere from three to five years to make a hurdy gurdy. The instrument is made of wood, wire and metal."
"The hurdy-gurdy is the only instrument that uses a wheel to play. It has three different kinds of strings, including a melody string. The instrument is made up of skin, bones, internal organs, and other materials. It is played by two people, using a crank and a string."
"In soap, fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent. In sandpaper, bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper. In cheesecake and all kinds of desserts, like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding, there's gelatin to make it look good."

"CNN's John Sutter looks at a new way to reduce infant mortality in the developing world. Sutter: The problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator, and you send it off to a midsized village in Africa, it will work great for a year or two years, and then it will break. So the question is: How do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form?"
"NeoNurture device is made from spare parts from your Toyota and a headlight. It's a great metaphor for the way ideas happen. The spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this. The idea is to stitch ideas from other people, people we've learned from, and we stitch them together."
"Innovative ideas don't just come to people in the lab, they come to them in a social setting. This is the way the world should be, says the founder of the London School of Economics. ""We have to build a society that is open to all kinds of ideas,"" he says."
"A lot of great ideas linger on, sometimes for decades, in the back of people's minds. I call this the ""slow hunch"" We've heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct. How do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this long half-life?"
CNN's John Sutter looks at the role of innovation in the workplace. Sutter: We often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property. He says there's a case to be made for valuing connecting ideas and not just protecting them.

"GPS was created by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. The program is now working in nine countries. Last year, it enrolled 300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers. The goal is to empower women and reduce stigma around the disease."
"In South Africa, each year 300,000 mothers with HIV give birth to children. In resource-rich countries, less than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive. 40 percent of children in resource-poor countries, in the absence of tests and treatment, are infected."
"In the United States, since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s, there's been an 80-percent decline in the number of HIV-infected children. Yet, still, over 400,000 children are born every year in the world today with HIV."
"Doctors and nurses in Africa don't have the time to do all the work they need to. They have to do everything from giving a test to feeding a baby in just a few minutes. ""It's not possible -- it doesn't work. And so we need to find better ways of providing care"""
"HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner, your family, anyone in your home, you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support. HIV isn't like other medical conditions; it's stigmatizing. People are reluctant to talk about it -- there's a fear associated with it."
"Mothers who are HIV positive work as health care workers. They are trained to care for HIV-positive children. The women are paid to do this work. The men do not get paid for the work they do, but to look after the children."
Rwanda has one of the highest rates of mother-to-child transmission in the world. The World Health Organization says the number of mothers with HIV is at an all-time high. The agency is working to reduce the rate of mother to child transmission. It is also working to educate the men in the family.
"There are 33 million people living with HIV in the world. Of these, two-thirds are in sub-Saharan Africa. ""If we can change the way households believe and think, we can"" change attitudes, she says. ""We have the medicines, we have the tests, but how do you reduce the stigma?"""

"The project aims to make the digital world graspable for humans. It's not that humans should get much more technical in the future, rather than that, technology, a bit more human. ""We live in a physical world. And I think making it physical is a good way to do that,"" says founder of the project."
"The iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity, you can see the tendency; it's getting physical. As humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy. Could we use that in mobile phones? Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile."

"New technology is changing our sense of self in the world, he says. New tools can be useful for self-discovery, self-awareness and self-knowledge. He says we think of these tools as pointing outward, as windows, but they can also turn inward and become mirrors."
"The self is just our operation center, our consciousness, our moral compass. So, if we want to act more effectively in the world, we have to get to know ourselves better. We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise, manage, govern, search."
"Some people believe that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species. One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics. The question is: has that damage erased the connectome? If it has, there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of frozen brains."
"Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history. Your brain contains 100 billion neurons and 10,000 times as many connections. Your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters. Eventually, these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves."
" neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain's neurons. Finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor. To find the connectomes of brains more like our own, we need more sophisticated technologies, that are automated."
"The brain is made up of neurons, which are connected by a network of synapses. To see the brain in three dimensions, you have to zoom in by a factor of 100,000. The brain is also made of tiny molecules called vesicles, which contain neurotransmitters."
"CNN's John Sutter takes a look at how the brain is connected to the rest of the world. Sutter: ""It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or a girl, everyone's brains are like spaghetti"" Sutter also looks at how genes can give us physical and mental illnesses."
"Sebastian Schulder: ""I feel curiosity, and I feel wonder, but at times I have also felt despair"" ""I would like to think that I am more than my genes,"" he says. ""Our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies,"" he adds."
"Finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time. It will take the work of generations to succeed. At the present time, my collaborators and I, what we're aiming for is much more modest -- just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain."
"Every connectome is unique, even those of genetically identical twins. Just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering. The connectome ""is where nature meets nurture,"" says Dr. David Perry."
"The connections of the brain's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows. Neuroscientists think neural activity is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientist think -- of thoughts, feelings and perceptions. ""I'm more than my genes"" -- all together."
"According to a theory that dates back to the 19th century, such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain. One way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes. If that were successful, that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome."
"In Afghanistan, 54 percent of children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition. People had hope, yes, but until they realized their situation worsens every day. The technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis-wiring of the brain."
"The family is central in Afghans' social system, and people feel used, worthless and ashamed. They retreat into social isolation, and do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones. Traumatized people also easily lose control -- symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks. The desperate try to restore order and normality."
"Jungian psychoanalyst and former Caritas Germany head of counseling in Afghanistan. ""The key here is empathy. Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you,"" he says. ""I want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children,"" he adds."
"Jung: We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach. The approach is now part of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan, he says. Jung: You can see the symptoms almost completely go away, and the stress is gone."
"Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world. The average age of the Afghan population is 17 years old. The majority of people in Afghanistan are poor, according to the UN. The UN says the majority of Afghans are poor and need help."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to Thailand to promote family planning. He says the Catholic Church was strong in the country, and Thai people were Buddhist. Defterio: ""We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution"""
"In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it -- so the condom is the girl's best friend. We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975, and the women who organized it said, ""We only want to lend to women who practice family planning"" And after 35/36 years, it's still going on."
"Vasectomy was offered to all men, but in particular, American men to the front of the queue, right up to the Ambassador's residence during his vin d'honneur. It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also. But we began with a family-planning program."
"Mechai: ""We had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS"" ""The government was in denial, denial, deny. So I went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations"" ""Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education"""
"No one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive, he says. The best teachers were the girls, not the boys, and they were terrific. Captain Condom, with his Harvard MBA, went to schools and night spots."
"In taxis, you get condoms. And also, in traffic, the policemen give you condoms -- our ""cops and rubbers"" programs. Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning. One says, ""Weapon of mass protection,"" with the American flag."
"In 1974, Thailand had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and schools. New cases of HIV declined by 90 percent, according to the U.N. According to the World Bank, 7.7 million lives were saved. 90 percent of the funding came from Thailand."
"The money goes from the tree-planting into a microcredit fund. The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise, the government says. Access to credit must be a human right, according to the government. The money goes into a fund called the Village Development Bank."
"Nike is sponsoring a village in Thailand. The village has a ""barefoot MBA,"" teaching people how to do business. ""Coffee and Condoms"" is the village's answer to Starbucks. The school is a focal point for economic and social development."
"""We have now found the weapon of mass protection,"" he says. ""If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you, it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years"" ""We use vegetables around the school ground, so they raise their own vegetables,"" he adds."
"""We should be talking about half, a quarter, one-tenth the energy content of today's materials,"" he says. ""It's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of material in the trash every time you get a package"""
"In nature, mushrooms are the recycling system. We can use mycelium to create materials with many of the same properties as plastics. These materials are made from natural byproducts, not petroleum. They are 100 percent compostable in you own home."
CNN's John Defterios has been using mushrooms to create biocomposites for the past three years. The materials are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives. The mushrooms use the energy contained in the seed husks to build a chitinous polymer matrix.
"Mycelium is a type of plant that self-assembles into fibers. It can be grown anywhere in the world using local open feedstocks. A major Fortune 500 furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment. They used to use a plastic packaging buffer, but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance."
"In a single cubic foot of Styrofoam, you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol. 20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year, in everything from building materials to surfboards. The EPA estimates, in the United States, by volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills."
" Prosperity is a shared endeavor. Its roots are long and deep -- its foundations, I've tried to show, exist already, inside each of us. Chris Anderson: Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this? I mean, can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying, ""GDP fell two percent this year?"""
"TJ: ""I want to see a world of nine billion people, all aspiring to Western lifestyles"" ""It has to be civil society. It has to have political leadership,"" he says. ""How clever would we have to be?"" ""I would take the two percent"""
"""I want to talk to you today about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity,"" he says. ""It's a 130-fold improvement, and that is 10 times further and faster than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history"" ""Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,"" he adds."
"Inventor of the Internet, Eric Cantor, says the internet is a form of art. He says it's a way to express ourselves in a new way. It's also a way for people to express themselves in new ways, he says. The Internet is a way of expressing ourselves, Cantor says."
"The U.K. has expanded the money supply, expanded credit and debt, so that people can keep buying stuff. The irony is, though, that we have cashed-out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth. This is a strange, rather perverse, story, just to put it in very simple terms."
"Keynes called this the ""paradox of thrift"" -- saving slows down recovery. Why is it that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change, he asks. These are things like buying energy-efficient appliances, putting in efficient lights and insulating homes."
"""What is the objective of the consumer?"" Mary Douglas asked. ""To help create the social world and find a credible place in it"" ""Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself,"" she said. ""But other behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings"""
"In the U.K. there are 4,000 community-interest companies that have sprung up in the last five years. They have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart. What would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature and stretched them?"
"Ecosia allocates 80 percent of its revenues to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon. It's a form, if you like, of ecological altruism -- perhaps something along those lines. We need the economy to put investment back into the heart of the model, to re-conceive investment."
"It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food, clothing and shelter. prosperity has social and psychological aims -- family, friendship, commitments, society, participating in the life of that society. It's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty."
"Google's Oceans project uses tags to map the movements of sharks off the California coast. The data, when visualized, is captivating to watch, says the project's founder. ""We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on,"" he says. ""They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles"""
We know where Yellowstone is for North America; it's off our coast. We have the technology that's shown us where it is. What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity. And then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from blue whales and white sharks.
Giant bluefin tuna is one of the most popular fish in the world. The fish has been around for more than 100 years. They are a major source of income for the fishing industry in the U.S. and other countries. They can also be used as a source of protein for humans.
"We can't see what it is that brings together a tuna, a leatherback and an albatross. It's hard to get up close and personal with a blue whale. We're putting them together in unusual ways, and this is taking us into the ocean."
"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by. ""We can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty and function,"" says aquarium's director."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working with a team of scientists to create a model of the world's largest fish. The model is based on a model that was created in the 1970s and 1980s. Defterius: ""It's the first time we've been able to do this kind of thing in such a large way"""
"The tags are attached to the fish and attached to a satellite. The satellite sends back information about the fish's movements. The tags can also be used to identify the fish, which can then be released into the wild. The tag costs about $1,000."
"Tuna were revered by Man for all of human history. Tuna can't get to schools of herring in the Gulf of Maine because it's too cold. They go to the eastern Gulf, then back to North Carolina and then to the Bahamas."
"Scientists are building new models to predict where management places should be. Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species, the single population, can be captured. Scientists are tagging large numbers of predators, not just tunas. Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag."
"For the first time, an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale, showing where the sharks go. Three teams tagged 1,700 tunas, bluefin, yellowfin and albacore all at the same time. Elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet."
"The U.N. has defined goals for the progress of countries. Low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. Even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year, and Turkey with seven per year."
"What we rely on is not an incomplete system. We have interviews, we have surveys. These surveys are costly, so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals. So this is a limitation. And all these colored lines here are results; each color is one survey."
"The U.N. has released a new report on child mortality in Kenya. The report shows that the death rate has dropped from 128 to 84 in the past year. The U.S. government has also released a report on the issue, but it's not as good."
"Kenya has seen a drop in child mortality since the 1990s. The U.N. says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent. The '90s was a bad decade, not only in Kenya, but across Africa. There was resistance for the old malaria drugs."
"In the 90s, only 1.2 percent of children in Africa died from smallpox. In the '80s and '90s, the rate dropped to 1.5 percent. The rate of child deaths is now at 1.7 percent."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at how the world's poorest countries are doing. He says it's time to stop thinking of Africa as one country. Defterio: ""It doesn't make sense to think of Africa in terms of one country"""
"Sweden achieved a low child mortality rate because it started early, he says. ""It's not about just five years -- it's long-term investments,"" he adds. ""We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better than us"""
"The aim here is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds, from 1990 to 2015. And isn't it a success story? Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest. Kenya is now speeding up. We have a problem in countries which are at a standstill."
"There is no such thing as a ""Western world"" and ""developing world,"" he says. ""Welcome to a decent life. We want everyone down there. This is the vision we have, isn't it?"" he adds. ""I just want not to have any room for doubt -- you have to see that for yourself"""
"The U.N. released a report on child mortality on Friday. The report labels South Korea and Qatar as ""developing countries"" South Korea gets Samsung, how can they be a developing country? Qatar is the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera. How the heck could they be [a] developing nation?"
"""It's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries,"" she says. ""We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world"" ""It's a decent life for children, we are talking about the future of all mankind,"" she adds."
"The gift came to me about five months ago. It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect. It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving. I'd like for you to picture it in your mind."
It will bring all of your family together. It will redefine your sense of faith. You'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing. It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball. And you'll have a new understanding of your body.
"CNN's Jim Boulden looks at the role of plants in our lives. He says they are more intelligent than we think. They are able to detect and respond to changes in the environment, he says. Bouldens: ""Plants are not just animals, they are also very intelligent"""
"Aristotle wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living. The blue whale, the biggest creature that exists on the planet, is a dwarf if compared with the Sequoiadendron giganteum. The artist that drew this observation test did some errors."
"Plants are able to respond to gravity, of course, so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity. But they are also able to sleep. During the night, they curl the leaves and reduce the movement, and during the day, you have the opening of the leaves."
"Plants are able to distinguish kin and non-kin. They communicate with other plants. Insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination. Even birds, reptiles, and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen."
"Noah: ""The tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals"" Noah: ""We have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period, and no one is taking care of plants"""
"Plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks. They are a network of small computing machines, working in networks. Until now, the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot. We have the animaloid -- and the normal robots inspired by animals, insectoid, so on."
"It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals, he says. Plants have computing power, they have electrical signals. The connection with the machine is much moreEasy, much more even ethically possible. But I think, as a community, we still have a lot to learn."
"Coca-Cola takes real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product. They tap into local entrepreneurial talent, and they do incredible marketing. Coke has a very clear bottom line -- they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit."
"Coke's been in Africa since 1928, but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets. Coke noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places. They decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs, giving them small loans."
"In 2003, the government of Ethiopia started a program to deliver health care directly to the people. In just five years, the ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one for every 2,500 people. The program is having a real impact in Ethiopia, and it's why child mortality numbers are down."
"Coke's global campaign slogan is ""Open Happiness"" But they localize it. ""Wavin' Flag"" by a Somali hip hop artist was localized into 18 different languages. It went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries."
"A million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation. If you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used. People reuse it for a slab for their home. They sometimes store grain in it."
"Coke is everywhere in the developing world. One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship. Women are refusing to marry men without toilets. Circumcision reduces HIV infection by 60 percent in men, according to the WHO."
"In 1988, there were 350,000 cases of polio on the planet. In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases. How did that happen? Let's look at a country like India. They have over a billion people in this country, but they have 35,000 local doctors who report paralysis."
"In less than a month, we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program. The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years. But we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer."
"AIDG has worked in Haiti since 2007, providing engineering and business support to small businesses. After the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed, to examine what was safe and what wasn't. If we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector, that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca-Cola."
"AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers, Architecture for Humanity, to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti. Seismic standards mean walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other. The Chilean quake was 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit Port-au-Prince."
"Haiti Rewired aims to reach out to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building. The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail. At the bottom is a confined masonry building, where the walls are tied together and symmetric."
"Haiti's earthquake is an opportunity to build better houses for the next generation. Instead of throwing chewing gum, or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish, we've developed fish sticks. The largest pollution burden on a body of water in Iceland is from people feeding the fish and the birds."
"The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right. This is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with; this is a different definition of health. People who come to the clinic are called, not patients, but impatients, because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues."
"The Environmental Health Clinic uses tadpoles as models of human health. The clinic uses the tadpole as a model for monitoring human health and well-being. It also uses them as a way to socialize with non-humans, such as children."
"The mice drank as much vodka as they did plain water, which was interesting. Mice are a very good representation of health. The mice self-administered antidepressants, the researchers say. They were testing if mice would also self-administer SSRIs."

"After September 11th, last year, I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it. I put together projects like Earth Sandwich, where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth. And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry."
"From 52 to 48 with love was a project around the time of the last election cycle. People started laying bread in tribute, and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain. But the truth was that as this start becoming popular, some rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing."

"Kiva allows people to raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of investors. Investors can either take their rewards back as cash, or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non-profit. It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world."
"We talk about ourselves as omnivores. We should call ourselves coctivors -- from coquere, to cook. We are the animals who eat cooked food. We carry in our face the proof that cooking, food transformation, made us what we are."
"Cooking made it possible that mutations, natural selections, our environment, could develop us. It's a technology so pervasive, so invisible, that we, for a long time, forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution. cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species."
"This technology affected two organs, the brain and the gut, which it actually affected. The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk. It shrunk to 60 percent of primate gut of my body mass. So because of having cooked food, it's easier to digest."
"The gut is a silent voice -- it's going more for feelings. The gut has a full-fledged brain. It's a digestive discomfort, which the gut is concerned with. So satisfaction was a very important part of the development. And as I say, energy was necessary."
"Our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system, they do speak with each other and make decisions. The gut is actually the largest immune system, defending your body. It penetrates the mucosa, the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest."
"The human brain is made up of two parts: the lower brain and the higher brain. The lower brain is responsible for sending signals to the upper brain, which in turn sends signals back to the lowerbrain. The two brains work together to send signals back and forth to the top of the brain."
"Dental anatomy is not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours. The more usual case is overeating. Despite generating a healthy hunger signal, the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut. It actually takes the signal and changes it, and we continue."
"Researchers have developed a way to talk to the gut brain to generate a balance between hunger and satiation. The language could go through the passage of the intestine, it would generate stronger signals. This is made for a diet which is soft, mushy, and reduced in fibers, which is easily chewable."
"""We need to find a way to turn off the faucet of single-use and disposable plastics,"" he says.

" Vijay Mallya: People who could not dream of sitting in a car, who were carrying their entire family in a scooter, are now dreaming of being in one. Vijay: I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia, about one and a half years ago."
"Gandhian engineering is the one which is going to take the world forward, he says. Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day, he adds. If you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe, you're talking about 10,000 days of income."
"It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system, a quick molding and modular components, enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments. You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way, whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day."
"Drug development 10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion. Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars. Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace, after all the human and animal testing, was 10 years. We used to have 40, now they have come down to 30."
"CNN's John Defterios speaks with Dr. Ravi Agrawal, director of the Centre for Research onirality (CSIR) in New Delhi, India. He says CSIR is developing new treatments for Psoriasis, cancer and other conditions. Agrawala: ""You can see this blending of traditional medicine, modern medicine and modern science"""
"Mahatma Gandhi said, ""Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need, but not every man’s greed"" The message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less, he said. ""It's not about low cost. It's about ultra-low cost,"" he added."
"""I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day. By young students from Standford University,"" he says. ""Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata. That's the new world that we want to create"""
"In the 20th century, India gave Gandhi to the world. In the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that. How do we produce global public goods, which are good for us, but good for everyone at the same time? And that's the good news."
"In 1970, if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously, you could do it. But to be able to do it, you had to be very rich -- a government, a multinational corporation, maybe the Catholic Church. Now, anybody has that capacity, which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors."
"In 2001, a non-state actor killed more Americans than the government of Japan did in 1941. ""We're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power,"" says U.S. President Barack Obama. ""Soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood,"" he says."
"Many people said the 2008 financial crisis was the beginning of the end of U.S. power. But in fact, this metaphor of decline is often very misleading. The other is power diffusion, the way power is moving from all states West or East to non-state actors."
"Goldman Sachs has projected that China, the Chinese economy, will surpass that of the U.S. by 2027. ""History is not linear. There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way,"" says David Frum. ""There may be some good news"""
"Economic power measured by GDP. Doesn't tell you much about military power, doesn'tTell you very much about soft power. It's all very one-dimensional. When we think about the rise of Asia, or return of Asia as I called it, it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing."
"Many people argue that the 21st century is going to repeat the 20th century, in which the European state system tore itself apart. The greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear. The United States is the only superpower, and it's likely to remain that way for two or three decades."
"Power is multi-polar. There are balancers -- the U.S., Europe, China, Japan can balance each other. Power can also be positive sum, where your gain can be my gain. It's not a zero sum, I win, you lose."
"Hard power is there, and it will remain. But unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power, you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we're facing. The key question is how do we work together to produce global public goods."
"Sustainability represents the what, the where and the how of what is caught. We must continue to eat the best seafood possible, if at all. Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws, or by Flipper, but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant."
Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat. He says we have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one. Jamie Oliver: Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality.
"CNN's John Sutter writes about the importance of healthy eating. Sutter: ""We can't just eat what we want, we have to eat it in moderation"" He says the best way to eat healthily is to reduce the amount of junk food we eat."
"Small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon. Shellfish, mussels, oysters, clams, tilapia, char were the common species. Environmental consideration was served with every plate, but it was also served with consideration for human interests."
I expect a lot from food. I expect health and joy and family and community and community. It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook. And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents.
"Everything we eat has a global impact. We need to savor vegetables and smaller portions of seafood. If we all take only what we need, then we can begin to share the rest. We can celebrate, we can start to restore."
 seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system. Restorative seafood acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource. We engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency. It's really not enough to just eat green list. And we need to save dinner.
"Israeli zoologist Yossi Ben-Ghiat says he's always been a bug lover. He says nature provides us with a good spider and a bad spider. Ben- Ghiat: What is the natural enemy, the biological control agent, or the ""good bug"""
"Israeli entomologist explains how a parasitic wasp inserts an egg into the body fluids of an aphid. Parthenogenesis, as it's so called, is the process of giving birth to other females. The aphids secrete a sticky, sugary liquid called honeydew, and this clogs the upper parts of the plant."
"The egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid. After a few days, depending upon temperature, the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the Aphid from the inside. This is, of course, not the end of it."
"Pest control is the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests. In Northeast Israel, in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu, there is a large population of ""minute"" bugs. The good ones go to the flowers, the bad ones to the plants."
"In 30,000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses, there, we are mass-producing those predatory mites, those minute pirate bugs, those parasitic wasps, etc. There are no GMOs -- genetically modified organisms -- whatsoever. We take them from nature, and the only thing that we do is give them the optimal conditions."
"In Israel, where we employ more than 1,000 hectares -- 10,000 dunams in Israeli terms -- of biological pests controlling sweet pepper under protection, 75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced. In the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley, where the pearl of Israeli agriculture is located, the impact is very strong."
"In either biological control or even natural control, resistance is extremely rare. The overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide, it's 250 million dollars. The more the public demands the reduction of chemicals, the more growers become aware of the fact that they should replace the chemical control."
"The aim is to create even more intensive and strict public demand for the reduction of chemicals in agricultural fresh produce. The game Farmville has 70 million players around the world and most of these players are playing it almost every day. It takes 200 real people about 56 days of real time to build, plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that."
"World of Warcraft is one of the biggest games in the world, with more than 10 million players globally. The game shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking. The biggest games are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players, about what everybody does."
"Games have the power to motivate, to compel us, to transfix us. And this allows something very special to happen in games. The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes. This sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling."
"Every time a box is opened, there's something in it, some little reward that keeps people progressing and engaged. ""There's 100 percent up here. There's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item,"" says game's creator."
"When people get to about 13 out of 15 pies, their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy. They're not rational about probability. They think this game is unfair. We can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes."
"The video games industry is the fastest growing of all modern media. From about 10 billion in 1990, it's worth 50 billion dollars globally today. We can take lessons from games and use them outside of games, he says. The first one is very simple: experience bars measuring progress."
"The University of Bristol is developing new ways to predict learning in the brain. Scientists are able to model mathematically dopamine levels, a neurotransmitter associated with learning. Dopamine is associated with reward-seeking behavior and is estimated to be worth 80 billion dollars in four years."
"""We're all in this together,"" says game designer. ""We're playing together. We're not playing against each other, we're playing with each other"" ""It's not about money, it's about creating a community,"" he says."
"Every single video game in the world uses a version of this system -- tens of millions of people. The success rate is at close to 100 percent. This is a player-developed, self-enforcing, voluntary currency, and it's incredibly sophisticated player behavior."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about how games can transform the way people engage with the world. He says games can be a ""unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage on a grand scale in games"" Defterio: ""I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands"""
"Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly. How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret? Well, the way we've come up with uses computers but doesn't depend on them. The secret is the ballot form."
"The vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth. It can be submitted, stored and displayed on a website for anyone to see. No one can break in and change your vote, because then it won't match your receipt. They can check that the announced result is the correct one."
Vladimir Putin: Democracy needs transparent and verifiable elections. Putin: We need to look at the whole Pacific Ocean in its entirety and make a network of MPAs across the Pacific so that we have our world's largest ocean protected and self-sustaining.
"The Phoenix Islands were the world's largest marine-protected area up until last week when the Chagos Archipelago was declared. The islands are out in the middle of the Pacific, right around the Equator. They're in the mid-Pacific, about five days from anywhere."
"The Phoenix Islands are part of a protected area of the Pacific Ocean. The islands are uninhabited, except for one island that has about 35 people living on it. There are more mountains in the ocean than there are on land. The average depths are about 12,000 ft."
"In the middle of the Pacific Ocean is a group of islands known as the Phoenix Islands. The islands are home to a large population of fish. The fish live on the surface of the island, which is why they are so important to the ecosystem."
"Kiribati is the largest atoll nation in the world. It controls between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet. Sea levels are rising, and Kiribati, along with 42 other nations, will be under water within 50 to 100 years."
The U.S. government of Kiribati is selling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters. The deal gives the country five percent of the landed value of the fish. The country never had any data from the Phoenix Islands before.
"CNN's John Defterios meets with Kiribati President Anote Tong to discuss his country's overfishing problem. Tong suggested a ""reverse fishing license"" to compensate the country for not fishing. Defterius: ""We basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment"""
"In 2002, a heat wave killed 60 percent of the coral off the coast of the Phoenix Islands. This year, the area has recovered faster than any other reef in the world. ""It's almost like if a person has multiple diseases, it's hard to get well, but if you only have one disease, you can get better"""
The Phoenix Islands Trust Board negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country. The PIPA Trust Board holds that license and pays the country for this. Kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment. The conditions for success here are listed.
"CNN's John Defterios has been diving in Antarctica. He says we don't know how the brain works. To make progress, we need to break the code, he says. But how? Defterio: I think we'll get there in the not too distant future."
"The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the ""Dragonball Z: Android Saga"" The more targeted our interventions, the better, he says."
"Receivers are made of materials that are encoded in DNA. Each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver. Receptors are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes. Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor, the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on."
"This is the first ever such experiment, sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's. Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA, we can achieve incredible precision. The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain."
CNN's Jim Boulden has created a new way to control the behavior of fruit flies. The fly's head is attached to a device that can be used to control its movements. The device can also control the movement of the fly's body.
"The fly's brain contains not only an Actor, but a different group of cells, a ""Critic,"" that provides a running commentary on the Actor's choices. You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the Catholic Church."
"Researchers used light-addressable cells to study behavior of two strains of flies. They found that the behavior of the fly on the left was very different from that of the one on the right. This suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice, the researchers say."
"Scientists have created an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly. In the toy circuit, the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue LEDs in the center of the board. LED's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air."
"Bertie County, Iowa, is the poorest county in the state. One in three of its children live in poverty. The economy is mostly agricultural. The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant. There is no coffee shop, no Internet cafe, no movie theater, there's no bookstore."
Only 27 percent of students in the state of North Carolina have a high school degree. The state's high school graduation rate is the lowest in the U.S. The national average is the highest in the United States. The average high school diploma is the equivalent of a bachelor degree.
"CNN's John Sutter travels to Bertie County, North Carolina, to meet designers and builders. He says the area is in need of a new type of design tool. Sutter: ""There is a total vacuum of creative capital in this area"""
"Bertie County is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed. The entire county is mostly farmland. This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of."
"Bertie County, North Carolina, has 27 people per square mile and 10 per square kilometer. The school district is redesigning how education is administered in rural communities. The goal is to create the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to make change."
"Only 10 percent of houses have in-home Internet connection. ""Design as education"" could teach design within public schools. ""It's hands-on, it's in-your-face, it requires an active engagement, and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning"""
"The project is a one-year program to train high school students to be architects and designers. The first project is an open-air farmers' market, followed by a home for the elderly. The students will work on the project for a year before returning to school."
"Studio H is a new project to teach young people the skills needed to be an architect and builder. The project will be open to the public at the end of the summer, when the school's farmers' market will be held. The school is the first of its kind in the U.S. and aims to be a model for other communities."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to designers about civil war and ethnic conflict. Sutter: ""Design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers"" ""We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter,"" Sutter says."
"There has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars over the past two decades. Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today. The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago."
"Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective, if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war. In some cases, there is a military victory of one side. This is a solution of sorts, but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences."
"The peace process in Northern Ireland was facilitated by Senator George Mitchell. Mitchell imposed very clear conditions for the long-term success of the peace process. Local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise. The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war in 2003 illustrates the importance of leadership, diplomacy and institutional design."
"The peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians has not been fully implemented. David Frum says the failure to reach an agreement is due to a lack of leadership. He says the peace deal is not the end of the conflict, but the beginning of a new era."
The problem of conflict in the Middle East is that it is often caused by a lack of political will. The solution to the problem is to find a way to make the conflict less violent. The key is to make it less about violence and more about peace. The best way to do this is to work together with other nations.
"The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made, clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation. The Homestead Act, signed by President Lincoln, unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands. The following is a time line of treaties made, treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles."
"In 1868, the U.S. government signed a treaty with the Lakota tribe. The treaty gave the Lakotas the right to use their land for hunting. In 1871, the treaty was amended to give the Lakote the right of self-determination."
The Pine Ridge Reservation is located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota. The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land. That clause was obviously ignored. The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson.
"The Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars. More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan. Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the US."
"In 1900, the US Indian population was less than 250,000, compared to an estimated eight million in 1492. In 1980, the longest-running court case in US history, the Sioux Nation versus the United States, was ruled upon."
"At least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold. Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity. Frequently, grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents, due to alcoholism, domestic violence and general apathy, cannot raise them."
"The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota. The ""fix,"" as it's called, may be much more difficult for the dominant society than, say, a $50 check."
"Lakota word for ""non-Indian"" means ""the one who takes the best meat for himself"" ""The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human, like we don't exist,"" Lakota say. ""It's forced child labor on an institutional scale"""
"CNN's John Defterios is the host of ""This Is Life"" on CNN.com. This week, he looks at the role of the media in the fight against climate change. He also looks at how the media can play an important role in the future of the world."
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has a jurisdictional problem. The Chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities, so they don't audit them. There are 500 of these facilities producing active ingredients in China alone. The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided to relocate to China."
"About 80 percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore, particularly China and India. We don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe, says the WHO. Governments who are failing at a national level have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level."
"In the 1990s, there were a series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. President Clinton convened a White House task force. The task force spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain."
"The problem is the lack of trust between the public and the private sector. We need to use the power of the public sector to help the public. The public and private sector need to work together to solve the problem. It's not easy, but we can do it."
"""We're not only enlisting the multinationals, we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good,"" he says. ""You don't need to believe me. Go to the website. Look at the audit results. Can I buy that product without compromising my ethics? That's the way the system works"""
"""We started out thinking this was a stopgap measure. We're now thinking that this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges,"" he says. ""What they lack is that safe space to come together, agree and move to action,"" he adds."
"The U.S. government is monitoring 50,000 cottonseed farms in India for child labor. The sporting goods industry, in particular, has stepped up to the plate and have done it. The more you step back, embrace complexity, the better chance you have of finding simple answers."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. The stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government. Sutter: The more you can zoom out and embrace complexity, the better chance you have of finding simple answers."
"TED Talk: "" Complex doesn't always equal complicated"" ""I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity,"" he says. ""I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species"" ""What I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future"""
"Why is math such an important part of society? ""It's part of human society,"" says professor. ""Math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn't -- like ""Am I drunk?"" And then you get an answer that's modern in the modern world,"" he says."
"Math is not equal to calculating. Math is a much broader subject than calculating. In math education, we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand. That's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice."
"In the past, calculating was the only way to do it. Computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means. Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies, but don't know how to fix it. We should be assuming computers for doing the calculating."
"I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating. I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre. I don't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek."
"CNN's John Defterios asks: ""What do you mean by the basics?"" He says we need to separate the mechanics of driving a car from learning how to use it. Defterio: ""We need to teach people how to drive a car, not just how to write a letter"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the divide between computers and paper. Sutter: ""Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand?"" ""Computers can really help with this problem, actually make it more conceptual,"" he says."
"The problem with math education is not that computers dumb it down, but that we have dumbed-down problems right now. I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work. I think understanding procedures and processes is important. But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world."
"""We have a unique opportunity to make math more accessible,"" says the professor. ""We can make it easier for people to understand what they are doing,"" he says. ""And we can do it in a way that makes it more fun for people,"" he adds."
"Many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group, he says. ""In the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians,"" he adds. ""It's done by geologists, engineers, biologists, all sorts of different people"""
"I want to see a completely renewed, changed math curriculum built from the ground up. We're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real-world math. We can engage so many more students with this, and they can have a better time."
"""What is beauty? It's whatever moves you personally,"" says David Perry. Perry: People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste. He says we need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences."
"The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations. Beauty is an adaptive effect, which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment. Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions, such as the horrid smell of rotting meat."
"Beauty is a way of encouraging people to make the most of their environment. The ideal landscape is one with open spaces, water and diverse greenery. This type of landscape can be seen in movies like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Starry Night"""
"It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet. But artistic and decorative skills are much older than that. Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair, as well as ochre body paint, have been found from around 100,000 years ago."
"Homo erectus made hand axes between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. Hand axes indicated intelligence, fine motor control, planning ability, conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials. Over tens of thousands of generations, such skills increased the status of those who displayed them."
"""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,"" says David Perry. Perry: ""It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors"" ""Beauty can be found in the smallest of things,"" says Perry."
"Inmates had a hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties, he says. ""Nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging, violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere"" ""I feel that I connect with the profound beauty of Israel, and I'm united with this country's history and biblical law"""
"When a kid like this gets into a fit, the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid. It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do. At the beginning, it was a disaster. I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere."
"Lance Armstrong's former cycling partner, Yossi Ben-Ghiat, has started a charity bike ride in Tel Aviv. Ben- Ghiat: ""When I reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere, I feel young, invincible, eternal"""
"Mountain biking can teach you important life-coping strategies. One of these principles is focus. I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore, it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and look around and see how the vista around you grows."
"CNN's Alex Vatanka is a CNN iReporter. He travels with children around the world in a cross-country bike ride. He says history and perspective play key roles in the way he plans his rides with the kids. Vatka: "" perspective and context and history play key role"""
"The Green School is a school for troubled kids from Ethiopia, Morocco and Russia. The classrooms have no walls. The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard. The school has an intact Hindu culture. The kids acquire the understanding that life is complex, and there's no black and white."
"At Green School, the children are smiling -- an unusual thing for school, especially for me. The classrooms have natural light. They're beautiful. The breeze passes through them. The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials."
"The second vortex to be built in the world, in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river. When the turbine drops in, it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity, day and night. These kids did a little graffiti on their desks, and then they signed up for two extra courses."
"The Green School sits in south-central Bali, and it's on 20 acres of rolling garden. Not many things didn't work. The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months. The teachers had to replace them with recyclable plastic."
"Bali has no paved roads, so the streets are paved with volcanic stones. The streets are also made from volcanic stones, which are used in the construction of homes. The stones are also used to build the fences that surround the schools. The school grounds are made out of grass, which is used to make the fences."
"The Green School is going into its third year with 160 children. It's a place of pioneers, local and global. The kids are from 25 countries. They know how to plant organic rice. They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them."
"The Green School is a new school in Bali, Indonesia. The school aims to create a new generation of global, green leaders. The teachers are as diverse as the student body, and volunteers are popping up. The Green School effect -- we don't know what it is."
Bamboo is as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up any roof. It comes out of the ground like a train. It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this.
"The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it. From the time the foundations were finished, in three months it had roofs and floors. You just have to follow these simple, simple rules: be local, let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build."
"CNN's John Defterios travels to the deep sea to meet conservationists. Defterio: The current international laws provide more protection to the areas closest to shore. The laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore, he says."
"The Sargasso Sea is known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers. It is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. But the same way it aggregates weed, it is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region."
"Bermuda is home to one of the world's largest populations of blue whales. The population is threatened by over-fishing, which has led to a decline in the number of fish in the area. The region is also home to the largest population of sea otters in the world, which are also threatened."
"The Galapagos Islands are one of the most biodiverse places in the world. The islands are home to more than 1,000 species of fish. They are threatened by over-fishing, over-harvesting and over-exploitation."

"More than four million people sustain a concussion every year, and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms. ""Starsky and Hutch""? Arguably, yes. So, a car accident. Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier: 35 Gs."
"The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness. It requires only a change in consciousness, and that can be any one or a number of symptoms. High-school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries. It takes them longer to return to a symptom-free baseline."
"Among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions, the incidence of early-onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population. The research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said, ""Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys?"""
"The CDC has a program, HEADS UP, specific to concussion in kids. A bill introduced by Senator Kefalas that would have required athletes, kids under 18, to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee."
"A $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education. A little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the g-force of impact by half. The only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury."
"""I am another image and vision of another survivor of war,"" she says. ""I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars"" ""Let us make this field a much bigger place. Let us all meet in that field,"" she adds."
"The sounds of war are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night. War, a friend of mine said, ""is not about sound at all. It is actually about silence, the silence of humanity"" ""It is very scary to go through that feeling of ""I am about to die"""
"We have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels. Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children. The front of wars is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space, guiding missiles toward unseen targets."
"We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars. There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting, and there is one that thinks peace is schools and jobs. Do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going?"
"""We need to understand how do we build lasting peace from both sides,"" she says. ""There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't include women,"" she adds. ""Women are the only ones who can make a difference in the world,"" she argues."
"""We need to invest in peace and women, not only because it is the right thing to do, for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today, but it is for the future,"" she says.

"CNN's John Defterios asks people where they go when they need to get work done. He says people often say the office, the house, the car or the train station. Defterio: ""Why is that? Why is that happening?"" He says the world would be better off if it was more equal."
"People trade in their work day for a series of ""work moments"" at the office. You cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes and really think about a problem. You might have a quick idea, but to be in deep thought, you need long stretches of uninterrupted time."
"Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages -- some people call them different things. You've got to go through phases and stuff, and if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well. Why do we expect people to work well if they're being interrupted all day at the office? That doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense."
CNN's John Sutter talks about how to avoid distractions at work. He says it's easy to get distracted on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. Sutter: It's harder to do your work when you're distracted by other people's activities.
"Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are just modern-day smoke breaks. The real problems are what I like to call the M&amp;Ms, the Managers and the Meetings. These are the things that you don't find elsewhere, but you do find at the office."
"Meetings are toxic, terrible, poisonous things during the day at work. The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together. There's often too many people in the meetings, and they're very, very expensive to the organization. Meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later."
The problem is that meetings are too long. They should be cut in half. Here are three ideas. One of them is to cut the meeting in half every week. The other two are to reduce the number of people in the office. The third is to make the meeting shorter.
"Giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work, he says. ""A tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other,"" he adds. ""You can quit the email app; you can't quit your boss. You can quit I.M."""
"There are very, very few things that are that urgent, that need to happen. If you do have a meeting coming up, if you have the power, just cancel it. I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses."

"This is a bathtub made out of scrap two-by-four. The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer. The faucet here is just a piece of Osage orange. The deadbolt is a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine."
"phthalmologist Dr. Michael Schulder says he gets a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer, and then you have lumpy tiles. If you put it in the front door, your design fails. The faucet is a beer tap. We're getting tired of it. It's kind of clichéd now."
"Human beings have a need for consistency of the apperceptive mass. Human perception needs to tally with the one like it before, or we don't have continuity. The first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA. All these houses are built from between 70 and 80 percent recycled material."
"Gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern. Repetition creates pattern. If we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go, ""Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it."" Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all."
"The Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism. By the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower. ""We have dumaflaches and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we, up to that point, had to do by hand,"" he says."

"TED Talk: Why do we pay so much attention to the Middle East conflict? TED Talk: Stories matter; as an anthropologist, I know that. Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge. They give meaning to our lives. That's what we tell here at TED, we tell stories."
"Anthropologists know that every culture has an origin story. Four thousand years ago, a man and his family walked across the Middle East. The man, of course, was Abraham. And what he stood for was unity, the unity of the family; he's the father of us all."
"CNN's John Sutter asks: What if the story of Abraham could be an antidote to terrorism? He says the story is about welcoming an enemy into your home. Sutter: ""You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham. You retrace the story"""
"Abraham was born in Urfa in Southern Turkey, and died in Hebron in the Middle East. A group of anthropologists decided to retrace the footsteps of Abraham. They crossed the border into Syria, went to Damascus, and went to Jerusalem."
"Thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East. Men, women, young people, old people -- more women than men, actually. In Cincinnati, for instance, they organized a walk from a church to a mosque. It's an amazing experience."
"In São Paulo, Brazil, it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run. The media love it; they really adore it. It spreads the idea of Abrahamic hospitality, of kindness towards strangers."
"The Abraham Path is a game-changer in the Middle East, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: The potential is basically to change the game. ""You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me,"" one woman says."
"A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. Insects remove dung, they pollinate our crops. They control pests, and they're food for animals. Even larger animals eat insects."
"Every one of you is eating insects, without any exception. You're eating at least 500 grams per year. Tomato soup, peanut butter, chocolate, noodles -- any processed food that you're eating contains insects. Insects are here all around us, and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops."
"All our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of, he says. A lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. The surimi sticks [of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat, is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal."
"The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. We have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent. In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year. In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50."
"We are eating way too much meat in the Western world. Insects are animals that walk around on six legs. Pigs are quite like us. They're even models in medicine, and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us."
"If you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. You have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. There's a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects."
"Insects are comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs. Of all animals on Earth, of all animal species, 80 percent walks on six legs."
"Insects are a delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper: shrimps. 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere."
"Insects are more abundant than we are, and we're not on a planet of men. Insects are involved in our economy, usually without us knowing. I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets -- not visible, but as animal protein in the food."
"Landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true. As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land. There was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed. We chose rats."
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. They're extremely sensitive to smell. Rats learn to stick their nose in a hole under which a target scent is placed. They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards.
Transformational technology could help Africa clear its borders of landmines. 11 African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology. The cost-price per square meter can be reduced up to 60 percent of what is currently normal.
"45 percent of people in Tanzania get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability. In our common language, Dutch, the name for T.b. is ""tering,"" which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar. If detected early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives."
"A rat can process 40 samples in a day, while a human can do the same in seven minutes. Microscopy in Dar es Salaam has increased case detection rates by up to 40 percent, says the project's leader. ""We have now currently 25 rats that can process 1,680 samples"""
"The first prototype is a rat with a camera that can go into rubble to detect for victims. The aim is to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to replicate this on a much larger scale. The project is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous detection tasks."

"The economy has changed from a manufacturing to an information and creative economy. Women have been better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. They're starting to dominate lots of professions -- doctors, lawyers, bankers, accountants. The men sort of stagnate there."
"Over 50 percent of managers are women these days. In the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade, all but two are dominated by women.

"The Internet is removing the middleman, so that anyone from a T-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer. The ubiquitous force of this peer- to-peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates. We are moving from passive consumers to creators, to highly enabled collaborators."
"We live in a digital age where we can communicate in real-time. This is a big shift away from the old way of doing things. It's a new way of looking at the world, and it's changing the way we live."
"We're at an inflection point where sharing behaviors are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives. From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed, we are consuming and collaborating once again.

"When BJ and Beverly were born, there were 450,000 lions, and today there are 20,000. Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000, according to the Big Cats Initiative. Tigers haven't fared any better, and cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,00."
"DJ: Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same, and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. The 20,000 lion figure is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease."

"Charles Limb: I'm going to review a study that I did, which was jazz in an fMRI scanner. It was done with a colleague, Alan Braun, at the NIH. It's a 35-key keyboard designed to fit both inside the scanner, be magnetically safe, have minimal interference."
"Jazz players were asked to memorize a piece of music and then improvise to the same chord changes. Scientists measured the number of notes played and then looked at the brain activity. An area that's active in the prefrontal cortex, the frontal lobe of the brain, was deactivated."
"Mike Pope is a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University and the National Institute of Health. His research shows that to be creative, you should have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe. One area turns on, and a big area shuts off, so that you're not inhibited."
"Jazz improviser Keith Jarrett is a well-known, iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a higher level. Jarrett will improvise entire concerts off the top of his head, and he'll never play it exactly the same way again.

"The MBI unit has now been FDA approved, but it's not yet widely available. Until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself. The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram."
"It takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer. We need to individualize screening based on density. For women without dense breasts, mammography is the best choice. We shouldn't abandon screening altogether, we need to offer them something better."
"Radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause. Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat versus connective and epithelial tissues. Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well."
"Mammograms have been around since the 1960's, and it's changed very little. Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast, but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally. The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment."
"The average MRI scan costs 10 times as much as a digital mammogram. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: ""It's just way too much equipment"" ""Big ideas can be orchestrated, if you can get people to talk about things that they don't normally talk about,"" Gupta says."
"A new type of gamma detector is being used to find small tumors. The detector is made of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector. If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent."
"Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue. MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density. The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells."
"Mammogram shows faint tumor, edges of which are blurred by dense tissue. MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly, as well as a second tumor, which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options. Of the tumors that we found, mammography found only 25 percent of those tumors."
"MBI is as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost. It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding."
"In 2008 and 2009, the news was so heavy. The economy was wobbling on the brink of collapse. My marriage wasn't going well, and we were growing further and further apart. My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of, had been battling mental illness."

And if you are a boy, you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD -- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder."
Bob Greene: Video games are not the cause of boys' lack of academic achievement. Greene: There are three reasons that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today. He says the first is zero tolerance for guns and knives in the classroom.
Boys are not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games. It's not OK to write these kinds of things in classrooms today. The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures is that there are fewer male teachers.
"In the last 10 years, the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half. 93 percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women. Men don't belong here, that's pretty obvious. The answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table."

"Radiologists used to put up 25,000 images, but now they can't do that anymore. Instead, they put all these slices together into a block of data. Block of data contains amount of X-ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about the development of computer graphics. ""Every month there are new graphics cards coming out, and here is a few of the latest ones,"" he says. ""It's really a huge challenge for us. It was cabinets of processors and storage"""
"The images are high resolution, and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today. The images show a woman who had a bleeding up in the brain, and that's been fixed with a little stent, a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel."
Swedish police have been performing virtual autopsies for the past four years. The body is transported in a body bag and scanned through a CT scanner. The data is then shared between the police and the forensic team. The results are then used to decide what to do in the real autopsy.
"It's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part of the body to another. It really, really helps the criminal to establish the cause of death. It's very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings."
"The virtual autopsy table is a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms. It really just works like a huge iPhone, and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface. We're trying to use it for educational purposes, but also, perhaps in the future, in a more clinical situation."
"This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now, but I hope they will in the future. Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then. These machines that came out in the 1970s would scan human bodies. They would generate about 100 images of the human body."
"Researchers have developed a device that can scan a heart in just 0.3 seconds. The heart is now beating in front of the researcher, so he can see how the heart is beating. He can go inside, push inside of the heart, and really feel how the valves are moving. This is really the future for heart surgeons."
"The research engineer, Motts, was wearing goggles so he could see things in the MRI system. He's seeing his own brain. The visualizations are brand new. They're something that we've been researching for a little while, he says."
"Computer Aided Tomography is a new form of imaging. The technology can be used to study the brain of animals, including lions. It can also be used as a tool to understand how the neurons are working, how the brain is working, and we can do this with high resolution."
"The image was taken from a series of images taken by a camera attached to a computer. The images were taken over a period of a few hours. The image was created using a combination of stills, video, stills and stills from a variety of sources."
You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in. It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes.

"Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country, rather than a developed country. Europe once commanded the future in its confidence. But this, alas, is no longer true. If you want to feel the future, try China -- there's old Confucius."
"The arrival of countries like China and India represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years. For 200 years, the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. As humanists, we must welcome this transformation, and we will have to learn about these civilizations."
"China is not like the West, and it will not become like theWest. It will remain in very fundamental respects very different. The conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms, using Western ideas. We can't do that."
"In 2025, Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. What gives China its sense of being China, comes not from the last hundred years, but from the period of the civilization-state. China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world, is shaped by a sense of civilization."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at two key issues facing China. The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity, he says. The second is maybe more prosaic, which is Hong Kong, Defterio says."
"The Chinese have a very, very different conception of race to most other countries. Of the 1.3 billion Chinese, over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race, the Han. The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together."
"The relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West. The Chinese view the state as an intimate -- not just an intimate actually, as a member of the family. The power of the Chinese state has not been challenged for 1,000 years."
The Chinese market is larger and more developed than anything in Europe. But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state. The state is everywhere in China. It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West.
"The West's attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality. It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best, and therefore we have the universal measure. And secondly, it's ignorant. We refuse to really address the issue of difference."
"The world is being driven and shaped, not by the old developed countries, but by the developing world. One part of medicine, though, has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well, and that's dentistry. People brush and floss their teeth. They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it."
" Connecticut dentists wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often. They divided them up into two groups. The low-fear group was given a 13-minute presentation on how bad it would be if they didn't brush. The high-f fear group, they laid it on really thick."
People who floss and brush their teeth are more likely to have a sense of empowerment. The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior. Even doctors are patients at some point in their lives.
"This is still the way we're communicating messages about health. When you give people specific information about their health, where they stand, and where they want to get to, that path -- that tends to work for behavior change. There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us."
"Psychologist: "" personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by"" ""We need to connect the information always with the action,"" he says. ""That action feeds back into different information, and it creates, of course, a feedback loop"" ""It's a difficult and expensive commodity, until now,"" he adds."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how we deliver health information in the U.S. Sutter: This is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare. He says the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads, or to follow their ads. Sitter: Who among us would actually say that people read this?"
"The ""drug facts box"" is a tool to help people understand the benefits and risks of drugs. The box was inspired by the nutritional information box in Cap'n Crunch. It's a good way to make sure people understand what's in the drug and how it affects them."
"CNN's John Sutter created a graphic to help people understand lab test results. Sutter: ""Blood test results are this great source of information"" ""They're just not for us.

"The CRP test is often done in conjunction with a cholesterol test. It's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed. The PSA test is used to test for prostate cancer, but there are all sorts of reasons why it might be enlarged."
"Wired magazine spent less than 10,000 dollars on the project. Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, the two largest lab testing companies, made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively.

CNN's John Sutter looks at how social media is changing the way we see the world. Sutter: Social media is making it easier for people to find out who they are and what they want to do. He says it's also making it harder for the media to control what people see and think about.
"In every single age category, women outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies.

"The Tarahumara Indians of Mexico have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years. The tribe has been hiding in the Copper Canyons of Mexico since the 1600s. The men are 70 to 80 years old and are still running mega-marathons. They're not doing 26 miles, they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time."
"The first humans had a brain the size of a pea. They didn't have any weapons, so they had to eat each other. That's the mystery of the early human brain. It's a mystery that we're still trying to figure out."
There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been. The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4:15. I could throw a rock and hit a high-school boy who can run faster than 4:10.
"The marathon has been going on for 20 years. It's run by men and women. The women run it at the same time as the men. The men run it first, then the women, then they run it again. If you run the first time, you're going to be faster."

"The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word ""pack"" You need to have those 64- and 65-year-olds who have been doing this for a long time. It makes no sense to have the antelope over there, and the people who want to eat it 50 miles away."
"The Tarahumara are a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age. The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego, be cooperative, and pull together. The reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt."
"Running is associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor. Geronimo used to say, ""My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs."" That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles."

"Work-life balance is a key issue for the future of the world, says Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He says the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the situation you're in. 'There are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,' he says."
"Government and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us, he says. It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead.

Cynthia Breazeal: Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child. She says the robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us. Brezeal: Over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots.
" CB: As a little girl, I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick. CB: People respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is, how likable, how engaging, how trustworthy. It turns out it's the same for robots."
"Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how? Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters? It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people. We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us. But with the robot, you can."
The MeBot is a fully expressive robot that can communicate with a remote collaborator. The technology was developed by MIT researchers to help families who live far away from each other.

"Cory Kidd: I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance-play technology. ""I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters"" ""If robots are persuasive, maybe they can help you maintain a diet and exercise program"""
"Researchers used robots to help people track their diet and exercise habits. The robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a dialogue modeled after trainers and patients. The longer a person interacted with a robot, the more likely they were to keep it off."

"The Sahara Forest Project aims to transform a desert area into an open space for people. The more vegetation we lose, the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change. The Namibian fog-basking beetle has evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert."
The beetle is able to harvest moisture in the air and channel it down to its mouth. The Seawater Greenhouse condenses humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle. The combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area.
"The Seawater Greenhouse uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat to create electricity. The idea is to use the heat to grow crops that would not be possible to grow in direct sunlight. The project is being led by the University of California, Berkeley."
"The Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food and renewable energy. In parts of the Arabian Gulf, the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants. We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts."

Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. People who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. They don't need psychiatric help.
"Parents sometimes argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed. They've grown used to their face; they think they're special. After surgery, everything normalizes. The adults behave more naturally, and the children play more readily with other children."
"People used to say to Sue, ""Why are you so miserable?"" People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood. So she chose to have facial surgery. After the surgery, she said, ""My face now reflects my personality"""
"When people get older, they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery. Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. After the surgery, they were perceived as being more intelligent, more friendly, more honest, less violent."
It was my longest operation. I did it with my neurosurgeon. We removed all the bones at the right side of his face. He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse. He had a son called Jeremiah. His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family.
"If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy. They're trying to achieve difference in their lives. We make judgments on people's faces all the time. It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces."
"U.K. jurors like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity. Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly. We think we can judge people on their expressions, but we're more comfortable with judging the moving face."
"A Nigerian woman has had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed. The operation was successful, but she wants to be out kayaking and climbing mountains. The surgeons used modern technology to make models of the jaw without bone in it. They then put bone and tissue from the back."

"CNN's John Defterios writes a weekly column on a variety of issues. This week, he looks at the future of cancer treatment. Defterio: ""We will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this, but they will die for a good cause"""
"""We will simulate specifically you, not just a generic person, but what's actually going on inside you"" ""Your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer, and we just have to prop those up in the right way"" ""I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future"""
"The genome really tells you much more about predisposition. The list of ingredients does tell you something, and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong. You really have to know what's going on in the kitchen. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease."
"Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing, and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing. Watson and Crick actually looked and found one. You can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients."
"Proteomics is the study of all the proteins in the body. Proteomics will be the way we treat cancer in the future, says Dr. Michael Bociurkiw. The proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells."
"David Agus: ""I see patients dying every day because we don't know what's going on inside of them"" ""I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference, if we could do it,"" Agus says. ""We can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once"""
The study could help scientists better understand how to treat cancer. Scientists are able to overlay two patients and look at the differences between them. The results could lead to a different idea about how to go about treating cancer. The study could also lead to new treatments for cancer patients.
Cancer is the hot topic. It is the place where we're learning the most. We are treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease. We're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill. So this is the great paradigm.
"In cancer, there isn't something else that's inside of you. It's you; you're broken. How do we diagnose that conversation? Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body. And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer."
"Proteomics is the study of how the body works. It's like the parts list of your body. It doesn't say how things are connected, what causes what and so on. What we need is to have a causative model of what's actually going on."

" biomaterials can be used to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so. We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here. This is actually a patient who [was] presented with a deceased organ, and we then created one of these smart biom material."
"In the last 10 years, the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled, while the actual number of transplants has barely gone up. We take a very small piece of that tissue, less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then place it in an oven-like device, and we're able to create that structure and bring it out."
"Scientists have been able to create human liver tissue using 3D printing technology. The technology allows the cells to be washed away and then re-perfused with the patient's own blood vessel cells. The next generation of technologies are more sophisticated printers, scientists say."
"The technology uses a scanner that first scans the wound on the patient. Once it's scanned, it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be. You can use scaffolds, biomaterials -- they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt."
"The strategy here is -- this is actually a CT scan, an X-ray -- and we go layer by layer, using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3D reconstruction. It takes about seven hours to print a kidney, so this is about three hours into it now."

"Khan: The paradigm here seems like a very simple thing: 10 in a row, you move on. But it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right now. ""You get hints, the actual steps for that problem, if you don't know how to do it,"" he says."
"Learn math the way you'd learn anything, like riding a bicycle. Do it as long as necessary, until you have mastery. The traditional model penalizes you for experimentation and failure, but it does not expect mastery. You can go to the site right now, it's all free, not trying to sell anything."
"From this we can actually teach everything -- well, everything that can be taught in this type of a framework. The paradigm is, once you get 10 in a row on that, it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules. We now have on the order of 2,200 videos, covering everything from basic arithmetic, all the way to vector calculus."
"Every row is a student. Every column is one of those concepts. Green means the student's already proficient. Blue means they're working on it -- no need to worry. The data gets pretty granular, so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong."
"In a traditional classroom, most of a student's time is spent on learning. But in the digital world, students can learn at their own pace. This is a way for teachers to use technology to help students learn more effectively. It's not just about teaching, it's about helping students understand the world around them."
"The idea of peer-to-peer tutoring is emerging as a global one-world classroom. The idea is that students in Calcutta can tutor your son, or your son can tutor that kid in CalCutta. The goal is to create a system where people can learn from each other in one place."

"The video was captured across multiple cameras. The bounce, that dip, lined up almost precisely with when each word was born -- word after word, systematically. The implications of this -- there are many, but one I just want to point out, is that there must be amazing feedback loops."
Dr. Richard Schulder and his wife are trying to understand the way language is learned. They recorded their son using a special home video recording system. They used the data to create a wordscape for the word water. They hope to understand how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned.
"The MIT Media Lab is using home video to map language patterns in the U.S. Using satellite dishes, the lab is pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States.

"In 1865, Montana passed its first water law. It basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream. Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream, and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers."
It takes about 5 pints of water to make a pint of beer. The U.S. has tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams. Montana brewers are looking for ways to reduce their water use. They're also concerned about the image of their brand.
"In some states, senior water rights holders can leave their water in the stream while legally protecting it from others. Similar problems are emerging in the East as well. In the U.S., companies with their water footprints and farmers with their senior water right on these creeks are at odds."
The program is a way to give back to the communities where the water comes from. It's also a way for the government to make sure the water is used for the benefit of the community. The program is funded by donations from the public and private sectors.
"Prickly Pear Creek runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena. It supports wild fish including cutthroat, brown and rainbow trout.

"Politicians are ""emotional freaks of one sort or another,"" he says. You can see it in the way we raise our young kids. Politicians have ""logorrhea dementia,"" which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane."
"The author's son and daughter were raised with the same social skills, he says. He says the kids are raised in a certain way, jumping through achievement hoops. They get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs, and they make a lot of money. They have kids of their own, and have achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people, he writes."
"CNN's John Sutter talks with Antonio Damasio. Damasio: ""We're developing a revolution in consciousness"" Sutter: ""It's not based on theology or philosophy, it's in the study of the mind"" ""We've been given a deeper view of human nature,"" he says."
"Emotions are not separate from reason, but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value. We're not primarily self-contained individuals, not rational animals. We emerge out of relationships, and we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another."
"We are now children of the French Enlightenment. We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties. This work corrects that bias in our culture. It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes to thrive in this life. It's not about grades, SAT's, or years in school, it's about social skills."
"In the United States, 55 percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with Mom. Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict with 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months, who was going to graduate from high school."
"Some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases, their own overconfidence. They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity. These traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ. The third is what you might call sympathy, the ability to work within groups."
"The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige. The unconscious mind hangs for moments of transcendence. We have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse are there creatures? We can't count and measure limerence."
"CNN's Jim Boulden asks: Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins? He says black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song. ""We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background,"" he says."
"Karl Schwarzschild was a German Jew in World War I, working on the Russian front. He was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity. Schwarzschild surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary. Space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole."
"Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity. He did not believe they existed in nature. He thought nature would protect us from their formation. It was decades before the term ""black hole"" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects."
"If a black hole were to eclipse the Milky Way, we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the galaxy. It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience."
"Gravitational waves are waves that travel at the speed of light. They are created when two black holes orbit around each other. They leave behind a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time. If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the sound."
"The universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent. The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close. At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic. But if you were to float by in space and you heard this, you want to get moving."
LIGO and LISA are being built on Earth to detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space. LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes millions of times the mass of the Sun. LIGO will be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.
"LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together. It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold."
"The Big Bang was 40,000 years ago, but we can still hear it today. The sound of the Big Bang is the sound of our universe. It's a terrible sound, but if we can hear it, we can find out more about it."
"Santiago Calatrava said, ""Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort"" The sun is for dynamics, for color changes. The High Museum in Atlanta has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy, together with Arup Lighting, who created a very subtle modulation of light."
"In the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design. The human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions. Together they create an environment that is never boring or dull, and therefore enhances our lives."
"Richard Kelly coined the terms ""focal glow,"" ""ambient luminescence"" and ""play of the brilliants"" These three distinct elements, together, make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better. And we can only create these out of darkness."
"There is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness. In today's modern medicine, there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way. And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment, we can help people to relax, or to be alert, to fall asleep."
"The world is changing, and light is a big part of it. The new technologies can help us to make the world a better place. We need to make sure we use the new technologies to the best of our ability. The future is bright, but the present is dark."
"The new LED lights are 200 times smaller than the old ones. The new lights can be used in a variety of ways, including in a dark room. The lights can also be used to light a room in a different way, such as in a bedroom."
"""We have to think again about light as a default solution,"" he says. ""Can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around?"" ""We are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for a much greater well-being"""

"One billion people live above the ""wash line"" and consume for more than 40 dollars per day. Two billion have access to washing machines. The remaining five billion -- how do they wash? They wash like this: by hand. They want the washing machine in exactly the same way."
"Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines. Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world population. The richest one billion use six of the 12 energy units used in the entire world. ""How can we tell this woman that she isn't going to have a washing machine?"""
"Growing population will lead to more energy use in the future. The best of the emerging economies will use as much energy as the Old West. The poorest of the poor will use the least amount of energy, but they will have more children."

"We are now taking control of our own evolution. We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet. We started selectively breeding animals many, many thousands of years ago. We don't have to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way."
"Scientists are using selective breeding and genetic technology to create new creatures. The liger is the largest cat in the world -- the lion-tiger hybrid. A cama is a camel-llama hybrid, created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama."
"Scientists have genetically engineered mammalian cells with a bioluminescent gene taken from deep-sea jellyfish. The cells glow in the dark under certain wavelengths of light. If they can do it with monkeys, they can probably figure out how to do it in apes, which means they can doing it in humans."
Some states have decided to allow genetically-engineered fish. Other states have banned them. Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures. The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution. The majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components.
The first genetically modified animals were born in the 1970s. They are now being used to make drugs and other products. Scientists are also using them to create new species of animals. The goal is to create a new type of animal that can survive in a new environment.
"DARPA has created a kind of insect bot, or bugbot. Using a joystick, they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right, forwards or backwards. The technology has gotten so developed that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired."
"Scientists have created an organic robot with electrodes and a camera on top of its head. The scientists can make this creature go left, right and through mazes. There's also been work done with monkeys. The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways."
"Scientists have created computer chips made out of living, self-aggregating neurons. They have also created a brain from a lamprey eel and a mouse that can be transplanted into humans. Scientists say we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes."

"Stuxnet behaves like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese -- sniffed, but didn't want to eat. The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found. Stuxnet is structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one."
The goal of this article is to show how the use of digital technology can be used to improve the quality of life. The goal is to make it easier for people to understand how to use digital technology to improve their lives. We hope this article will help people understand the importance of using digital technology.
"Stuxnet was designed to target Iran's Natanz nuclear facility. The attack code has an almost identical structure to Iran's centrifuges. The small warhead is taking one cascade, and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down. The big warhead talks to six cascades and manipulating valves."
"Stuxnet intercepts the input values from sensors and provides legitimate program code, which is still running during the attack, with fake input data. The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system. The gray boxes don't run Windows software; they are a completely different technology."
"If we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box, then we are in business. It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment. So it would work as well as in a power plant or in an automobile factory."

"Puppets always have to try to be alive. An actor struggles to die onstage, but a puppet has to struggle to live. The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer, carries on with a second person."
"Adrian Jones' father used to make plywood canoes in their workshop. Jones' mother was a puppeteer. Jones: ""I hated puppets. I really thought they were so beneath me"" It took 10 years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa."
The puppet horse was created for a play at the National Theatre in London. The horse is controlled by a person in the hind legs and the tail by a man in the front. The play is about a boy who falls in love with a horse and joins the First World War.
"Puppy is a cardboard model, a little bit smaller than the hyena. The legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there. It had to be shipped to London. The prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated."
"The horses are completely handmade. There is very little 20th century technology in them. Because they have to be light and flexible, and each one of them is different, they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately. And now we would like to introduce you to Joey."
"Horses' hearing is very important. It's almost more important than their eyesight. When they point right back, the horse is fearful or angry. Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down and the ears listen, either side."
"BJ: Horses are so unpredictable. The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action. The hind legs have got the same action. And together, there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression."
"The horse's skin is made out of a see-through nylon mesh. Zem Joaquin will ride the horse for us. The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called ""Faustus in Africa"""

"At each threshold, the going gets tougher. The complex things get more fragile, more vulnerable. The Goldilocks conditions get more stringent, and it's more difficult to create complexity. We, as extremely complex creatures, desperately need to know this story."
"The universe is expanding at incredible speed. Within the first second, energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity. The universe consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms, and they have no structure. Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that there are just tiny differences in that background."
"Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff. So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds. And each cloud is compacted, gravity gets more powerful as density increases. At the center, the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees, protons start to fuse, and -- bam! We have our first stars."
"Rocky planets are more complex than stars because they contain a greater diversity of materials. The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile, significantly more vulnerable, but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity. Living organisms are created by chemistry."
"Early Earth had oceans of liquid water and a great diversity of chemical elements. In gases, atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up. In liquids, they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules. Life introduces an entirely new trick."
"DNA contains information about how to make living organisms. It copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean. Once in every billion rungs, there tends to be an error. DNA is, in effect, learning. It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work."
"An asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula, creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war, and the dinosaurs were wiped out. Human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago. Human language is so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned."
Humans have been learning since the beginning of time. They learned how to adapt to their environment. We are the only species in the world that can do this. It is a gift that we have been able to use for thousands of years.
"Human history is a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role. But it also contains warnings. Collective learning is a very, very powerful force, and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it. The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change."
"The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change. But even when they do talk about important political issues, they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement.

"After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak, eat or drink, I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me. The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc. When I heard it the first time, it sent chills down my spine."
"This is the first voice they've created for an individual. There are several very good voices available for computers, but they all sound like somebody else. Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me, but the words jump up and down."
"CNN's John Sutter recalls the first time he heard of the computer. Sutter: ""For almost all of its millions and billions of years, there was no life on Earth"" ""In cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago,"" Sutter says."
"The speaker reflects on the evolution of technology, particularly PLATO and early computing experiences. They note the birth of virtual communication tools in their hometown and personal involvement with early computer systems. Recounting experiences from the 1970s onwards, they emphasize the rapid pace of technological advancement and anticipate future developments with wonder and anticipation."
"The speaker, reflecting on the profound impact of living in the digital age, highlights the crucial role of communication and technology in their life, particularly after facing health challenges. Expressing gratitude for his wife's support, they emphasize the transformative power of the internet, enabling global connectivity and providing a voice despite physical limitations. Their online presence serves as a vital platform for expression and connection, fostering continual learning and adaptation."
"Despite multiple surgeries for salivary cancer, leaving him without a jaw and experiencing back pain from tissue harvesting, the speaker maintains humor and resilience. Facing assumptions about his mental acuity and physical abilities, he recalls expecting a swift recovery to resume his movie review show. Others' reactions vary, from speaking loudly to avoiding eye contact, highlighting societal discomfort with disability and disfigurement."
"Marcin, a farmer and technologist, embarked on creating open-source machines to enhance industrial productivity on a small scale. He shared 3D designs and instructions online, spurring global collaboration. Eight out of 50 machines have been prototyped, fostering self-sustaining growth. Marcin believes open-source hardware can empower individuals worldwide, including American farmers and entrepreneurs, by lowering barriers to farming, building, and manufacturing, unlocking vast human potential."
"Marcin, born in Poland and now in the US, founded Open Source Ecology, aiming to democratize production through open hardware technology. He developed the Global Village Construction Set, comprising 50 essential machines for modern life, like tractors and circuit makers, in a DIY, cost-effective manner. Marcin's journey, from earning a Ph.D. in fusion energy to realizing the need for practical skills, propelled him to initiate transformative projects."
"The speaker's farm venture led to a realization of the need for robust, low-cost tools. Transitioning to organ transplantation, they highlight the shortage of donor organs, prompting campaigns for organ donation. Despite advancements, moral controversies arise regarding voluntary donations versus coerced ones, extending from related to unrelated donors. The ethical dilemmas persist despite medical progress and the efforts to expand the donor pool."
"The speaker, a surgeon, grapples with the moral conflicts of organ transplantation, including harvesting from executed prisoners. Despite achieving medical milestones, such as Asia's first successful cadaveric liver transplant, ethical dilemmas persist. Reflecting on the impact of surgical practices, they question traditional methods, advocating for more humane and innovative approaches, as surgery evolves from invasive to minimally invasive techniques."
"The speaker, a transplant surgeon, witnessed the challenges of whole organ pancreas transplants, inspiring a shift towards cell transplantation. Fascinated by stem cell research's potential, they focused on adipose tissue-derived stem cells, aiming to bypass ethical controversies. Fat-derived stem cells, abundant and non-controversial, offer promising therapeutic applications. Despite initial skepticism, their research underscores fat's significance as a rich source of adult stem cells for medical advancements."
"TThe surgeon recounts advancements in stem cell research, highlighting the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) by Yamanaka and Thomson. iPS cells offer potential for regenerative therapies without the ethical dilemmas of embryonic stem cells. Their lab focuses on reprogramming fat cells into rejuvenated stem cells, potentially treating various diseases. Personal experiences, including a retinal condition, foster empathy and underscore the significance of stem cell research for medical breakthroughs."
"Stem cell research holds promise for treating blindness, retinal diseases, and various conditions. With 117 clinical trials for liver diseases and 170 for heart disease, stem cells offer potential for repairing damaged organs and tissues. The speaker anticipates stem cells' transformative impact on cardiology, offering hope for incremental repair and new beginnings in medical treatment."
"Stem cell therapies offer potential to reduce reliance on donor organs, with trials underway for spinal cord injuries and stroke treatment. The speaker reflects on their journey from organs to cells, navigating controversy with hope for longevity and improved quality of life. They advocate empathy, urging individuals to understand others' perspectives to foster a unified, transformative worldview."
"The speaker discusses Chinese influence on a small ruling class in the US, highlighting disparity and discontent among the majority. They express empathy for Iraqi struggles, advocating understanding across different perspectives. Criticism is directed at the elite benefiting from Chinese alliances, while ordinary people face challenges. The speaker reflects on sociological insights and common frustrations."
"CNN's Jim Boulden asks readers to put themselves in the shoes of an Iraqi soldier. ""You know what they're doing here. And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear,"" he says. ""And we fight back, and it gets really ugly,"" he adds."
"You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq. You want your kids to have a better life. The reason anyone is interested in your land, and particularly the United States, is oil. It's because somebody else has a design for your resource."
"The U.S. has an entire economic system that's dependent on that oil, he says. Iraq's cities are all dependent on oil. ""This is Iraq. This is what you see. You see people struggling to get by. It's not easy,"" he adds."
"The United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending. The U.S. doesn't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world, he says. ""You can't help but think that. All because of oil,"" he adds."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the impact of war on the United States. Sutter: ""How is that possible?"" He asks: ""Everyone in your country has been touched by the violence, the pain, the horror"" ""There's something else about these people, these Americans who are there,"" Sutter says."

"""It's a holy war against Muslims. ... And you're thinking, ""My God, these Christians are coming to kill us"" ""You feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened,"" he says. ""These Christians -- who are these Christians? They're so evil, they're so mean"""
"Sam Richards: ""These Christians are nuts! They're training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus"" ""They even teach their kids -- they train them in the same way the US Marines train,"" he says.

"CNN's John Sutter asks readers to imagine a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag because her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising. ""I feel her. She's my sister, my wife, my cousin, my neighbor,"" Sutter says. ""She's anybody to me"""
"CNN's John Sutter asks viewers to put themselves in the shoes of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq. Sutter: ""Can you feel the rage? Can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks?"" ""It shouldn't be that difficult,"" Sutter says."
"""You're allowed to hate these people with every fiber of your being,"" he says. ""What do you think they're feeling?"" he asks. ""Can you feel their anger, their fear, their rage at what has happened in their country?"" ""That's empathy. It's also understanding"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us. Sutter: ""I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this"" ""Most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong,"" Sutter says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right. Sutter: ""I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives"" ""If you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make,"" he says."
"The author says we get stuck in a feeling of rightness when we're wrong about something. He says there are two reasons for this. One is structural, the other is cultural. We don't know when we are wrong, until it's too late."
"When you're a child, you learn that people who get stuff wrong are lazy, irresponsible dimwits. We learn these really bad lessons really well, and a lot of us deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over-achievers."
A woman wakes up with the wrong side of her body in bandages. The surgeon had performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one. The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous.
"When people disagree with us, we assume they're idiots, he says. When that doesn't work, we move on to a third assumption: they're deliberately distorting the truth. This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to."

"CNN's Jim Boulden is on a mission to understand the universe. He is looking for signs of dark matter, which is thought to make up nearly all of the universe's matter and antimatter. He will share some of his findings with CNN readers."
"Physicists go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector. Neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules. But you need very, very large volumes of water in order to do this."
"This is the view from the top of one of the world's largest ice sheets. The ice sheet is about 40 to 50 kilometers deep. It takes about two months for the ice to thaw in this region of the Earth. This is the peak of the ice sheet, and this is where the workers are working."
The Very Large Telescope in Chile is one of the world's most advanced telescopes. Each mirror is made of a single piece of high-tech ceramic. The telescope is being used to study how the universe is expanding. The next telescope will be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.
The Atacama Desert is good for telescopes because of the high altitude desert. Some of the most amazing experiments are being done in Antarctica. This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men when they first came to Antarctica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole.
"A cosmic ray experiment has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere to an altitude of 40 km. About a thousand people work here in summer, and about 200 in winter when it's completely dark for six months. And this particular balloon, because it has to launch two tons of weight, is an extremely huge balloon."
"Anil Ananthaswamy visited an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India. He also went to see telescopes, detectors, instruments that people are building, or have built, in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail."
"""I no longer want to postpone anything in life. And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people. I've tried to get better at everything I tried to do,"" he says. ""I collect bad wines. Because if the person is there, I'm opening it"""
I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy. I've not had a fight with my wife in two years. I didn't want to go; I love my life. I only wish I could see my kids grow up.
"""The only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad,"" he says. ""I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day. I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently"""
"""I learned that it all changes in an instant. September 11 created a security model in a lot of people's heads,"" he says. ""Strong feelings can create a model. Eventually, the new model will replace the old model,"" he adds."
" Psychiatrists can create a model instantaneously, because they're very emotive. There's often no right or wrong here. It's a model we just accept pretty much by faith. Some of us have a burglar alarm system at home and some of us don't."
"The smoking debate took 40 years -- and that was an easy one. In 1982, there was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings in the United States. In the long term, both feeling and reality are important. For the first time in our species, feeling chases model, model chases reality."
"The tamper-proof drug industry was invented after a spate of copycat attacks. The RFID bracelet on the baby now has a corresponding one on the mother, so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward, an alarm goes off. A lot of times, these trade-offs are about more than just security."
"Security is two different things: it's a feeling, and it's reality. We make these trade-offs again and again, multiple times a day. We often won't even notice them. They're just part of being alive; we all do it. Every species does it."
"We tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks. We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense. The answer is, we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality. Most of the time, feeling and reality are the same."
"The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar. People underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in ones they don't. If a risk is thrust upon you -- terrorism is a good example -- you'll overplay it. There are a bunch of other of these cognitive biases, that affect our risk decisions."
"When something is so common, it's no longer news. Car crashes, domestic violence -- those are the risks you worry about. One in a million, one in a billion -- they're both almost never. And what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality."
"Security is a trade-off between security and feeling secure. If you don't understand the risks, you're likely to get the trade-offs wrong. Security theater is exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly. Maybe it's what the CIA is supposed to do for us."
"There aren't enough examples of failures. Feeling and model are in our head, reality is the outside world; it doesn't change, it's real. In a primitive and simple world, there's really no reason for a model. You need models to understand a lot of the risks we face."
"This model is an intelligent representation of reality. It's limited by our cognitive biases. But it has the ability to override our feelings. Models can come from the media, from our elected officials ... We get them from religion, from culture, teachers, elders."
"A lot of models come from science. Health models are a great example. The question is not whether this makes us safer, but whether it's worth the trade-off. We change light bulbs without even thinking about it. Our model of security around electricity is something we were born into."
"When swine flu first appeared, the initial news caused a lot of overreaction. As the novelty wore off and the months went by, there was some amount of tolerance; people got used to it. When the vaccine appeared last winter, a surprising number of people refused to get it."
"Security decisions have a variety of people involved. The question is: Was it worth it? The history of the past 50 years shows how a model changes and how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like. When I was a kid, no one wore a seat belt. Nowadays no kid will let you drive if you're not wearing a seatbelt."
We tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs. Global warming is a great example. We're terrible at models that span 80 years. New models that extend long periods of time are hard. We can have both models in our head simultaneously.
"CNN's John Sutter talks about how nature makes materials. Sutter: ""When we think about future technologies, we actually think of using bacteria and viruses"" ""I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old,"" Sutter says."
"The material is made up of a mixture of calcium, carbonate and protein. The material can be used to build structures that are difficult to make in the real world. The materials can also be used for other purposes, such as to make solar cells."
"""I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials, and there's a lot of secrets to how they do such an exquisite job,"" she says. ""It took them about 50 million years to learn how to make that abalone shell"" ""We had to develop a way to do this more rapidly"""
"Viruses can't replicate themselves, so they need a host. Scientists can infect a virus and make millions of copies of that particular sequence. The viruses can then be used to grow semiconductors or materials for batteries. The first high-powered battery went to the White House for a press conference."
Virus-assembled nanowires can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. You can also do this with solar cells. Genetic engineering can increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems.
"The book is about how nature makes materials, and how to use them in new ways. Author: ""What if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish? ... Or give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time?"""

"Arvind Gupta is a toymaker from India. He has created a series of toy polygons. He says the polygons are like an amoeba, constantly changing its own profile. The polygons can be made into different shapes by different methods."
"Triangles are the only rigid structures that can be made into 3D shapes. ""We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come, it would start doing a jig,"" he says. ""If you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick, you'll get a T joint"""
"In 1978, French students were revolting against authority in the streets of Paris. ""It was a very revolutionary time. And I thought this was so much better than making trucks,"" he says. ""Every time I go to a school, I see a gleam in the eyes of the children. I see happiness in their faces"""
The best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it. Children want to make things. They want to do things that are provocative. So all you do is -- it's a very kind of provocative statement. This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.

"The material is made from organic green tea. It is super-absorbent and can be folded and sewn into a three-dimensional shape. The material is also very light-weight, transparent and flexible. It looks a little bit like human skin, which intrigues me."
"Bacterial cellulose is already being used for wound healing, possibly in the future for blood vessels, possibly even replacement bone tissue. With synthetic biology, we can imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality, quantity and shape of material that we desire. We could imagine growing a lamp, a chair, a car or maybe even a house."
"Bruno Giussani and Suzanne Lee are working on a project to grow kombucha. Kombucha is a mix of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms that spin cellulose in a fermentation process. Over time, these threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface."
"At early times, the universe was also very, very smooth. Conditions near the Big Bang are very different than the conditions of the air in this room. Things were a lot denser. The gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near theBig Bang."
"Ludwig Boltzmann, an Austrian physicist in the 19th century, helped us understand entropy. Entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that macroscopically it looks the same. It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly."
"Boltzmann: The fact that you are born, and then you die, always in that order, that's because entropy is increasing. He says the early universe was very, very smooth. ""The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further,"" he says."
In 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before. We learned that it's accelerating. The universe is not only expanding. It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other. This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future.
"There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe. Space may be finite or infinite, but because the universe is accelerating, there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see. Even though time goes on forever, space is limited to us. The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations."
Boltzmann studied the possibility of high entropy in the universe. He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton. Boltzmann then went onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas -- the multiverse and the anthropic principle.
"We live in the part of the universe where we are not affected by the universe's fluctuations. This is the part where we live in a state of thermal equilibrium. In this state, we are able to process information and talk to each other."
"The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so. It's cooling off. If the dark energy remains around, the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel. They will fall into black holes. The universe that we tell you about, versus the universe that really exists."
"We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes. That universe will last 10 to the 100 years -- a lot longer than our little universe has lived. Even black holes don't last forever. They will evaporate, and we will be left with nothing but empty space."
"The Big Bang is a brute fact about the universe that you should accept and stop asking questions. Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. Maybe there is something that naturally, through the growth of the laws of physics, gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations."
"""It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer"" to why the universe is the way it is. ""It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it"" ""Nothing in the universe wears out"" ""It's all about sex"""
"CNN's John Sutter has been covering the natural world for more than a decade. Sutter's new documentary, ""The Garden of Earthly Delights,"" airs on CNN at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday. The film is based on the book by the same name, which tells the story of the creation of the world."
"Penguins are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with. They are like the canary in the coalmine. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you."
"Paul Nicklen is a photographer specializing in the polar regions. Nicklen: ""I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest"" ""I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him"""
"Polar bears could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. Polar bears are amazing hunters. As long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. The polar bear was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that his only defense was to keep eating more seal."
Polar bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now. Big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process.
"The ice in the Beaufort Sea acts like the soil in a garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. I hope you appreciate yours."
"CNN's John Sutter traveled to the Arctic to document the decline of the region's ice. Sutter took pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, narwhals, and leopard seals. The Arctic is home to billions of amphipods and copepods, which are key to the food chain."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to Antarctica to document the plight of leopard seals. He says the animals have a bad reputation, but they're actually very misunderstood. Defterio: ""I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seal"""
"Leopard seals are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. They are also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home."

"The process of making a film is very simple. The film is made of a mixture of water and a protein. The protein is then added to the water to create the film. The process is then repeated to create a finished film. It's a very simple process, but it's very effective."
" silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface, which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale. It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology. The material can assume a lot of formats, including optical components and microprism arrays."
 silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics. You can do gears and nuts and bolts -- that you can buy at Whole Foods. The gears work in water as well. And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins.
The material is biodegradable and biocompatible. You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted. It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature. The material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true.
"Silk acts like a cocoon for biological matter. When you add things when you pour, the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants. It's edible; it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response."
"The silk worm uses two ingredients, protein and water, that are in its gland, to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection. Using 3D ultrasound technology, we can now see that developing babies appear to smile, even in the womb. Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72.9 years."
"More than a third of us smile more than five times a day, according to a new study. The study found that smiling is the most common way to express happiness. It is also the most natural way to show that we are happy."
"Charles Darwin believed that smiling made us feel better. A new study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving 16,000 pounds in cash. British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate."
"Smiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine. Smiling can also increase the levels of mood-enhouring hormones like endorphins, and reduce overall blood pressure. A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile, you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous, but you also appear more competent."
"Richard Feynman was a great friend and colleague. The two of them would play macho games together. He would almost always win, but when he didn't, he would laugh and have as much fun as if he had won. He made me feel smart."
"Richard Feynman hated intellectual pretense more than anything else. He hated phoniness, false sophistication, jargon, he says. He once told a story about a Susskind sandwich and said, ""Well, they'd be about the same"" The truth of the matter is that aFeynman sandwich had a load of ham, but absolutely no baloney."
"Richard Feynman: Can you build a machine that thinks like a human being that is conscious? ""It was a very, very dangerous thing to do around Dick Feyn man,"" he says. ""He let them have it -- both barrels, right between the eyes,"" he adds."
"""I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had. We liked each other; we liked the same kind of things. He was a man of many, many parts. But he was convinced of this. And he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection"""
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks to physicist Richard Feynman about his childhood. He says he had a close relationship with his father, who taught him how to use tools. ""He went off like a lightbulb. There went that theory, down the trash can of history,"" he says."
"Feynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest, most elementary solution to a problem that was possible. If it wasn't possible, you had to use something fancier. Feynman deeply believed, he truly believed, that if you couldn't explain something simply, you didn't understand it."
"Richard Feynman tried to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like. He would try to visualize it, guided by a small number of simple principles. The simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium."
"Feynman diagrams were constructed for -- to understand particles. The experiments that were going on were very simple: you simply take the proton, and you hit it really sharply with an electron. The only problem was that Feynman. diagrams are complicated."
"Feynman said, ""Forget all of that. Just think of the proton as an assemblage, a swarm, of little particles"" He called them ""partons"" Because they're moving real fast, relativity says the internal motions go very slow. The electron hits it suddenly -- it's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the Proton."
"Scientists are working on ways to make the brain work more like a computer. They hope to be able to control seizures with light instead of drugs. The technology could also be used to help people with disabilities, they say. ""I think the answer is we should honor Feynman by getting as much out of our own brains as we can,"" says one scientist."
"Scientists are trying to turn circuits and cells of the brain on and off. They hope to figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies. Already, a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them."
"Many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders. Some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain. If we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors, that'd give us the tool to activate and shut down different cells."
"The brain doesn't feel pain. The brain senses light with a little eyespot, which works not unlike how our eye works. When blue light hits it, it opens a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eyespot. That allows this eyespot to have an electrical signal, just like a solar cell charging a battery."
The brain is made up of hundreds of billions of cells. Scientists have been able to use viruses to activate specific cells in the brain. This can be used to target specific areas of the brain that are at risk for brain damage. The brain is a very complex system.
"The brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells, maybe tens of thousands. If we could figure out what cells they are, we could maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against. Then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to date in a dish."
Scientists are trying to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off. They are using an optical fiber array to activate different targets in thebrain. The aim is to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear.
Molecules called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsin respond to green and yellow light. They come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules. They project and connect to different brain regions. They also change in different ways in different disease states.
"There are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors -- light sensors in the back of our eye -- are gone. It's not clear that a drug could cause this to be restored, since there's nothing for the drug to bind to. On the other hand, light can still get into the eye."
"Researchers are trying to convert spared cells in the eye into high-resolution cameras. The work is being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company, Eos Neuroscience, which is funded by the NIH. Researchers will take blue light photo sensors and install them onto a layer of cells in middle of the retina in the back of the eye."
Scientists are developing new ways to study and treat brain disorders. They are also developing new tools to help people live their lives better. One example is a device that allows people to use their eyes without leaving their bed. The technology could also be used to help the sick and elderly.
A new bridge is being built in London to replace an old one. The new bridge will have an open platform for passengers to get on and off the bus. The project is the brainchild of London-based architects and engineers. It is the first of its kind in the world and will cost about $100 million.
Paddington's new bridge is made of steel and timber. The bridge was designed to look like a kiss between the two sides. Paddington is working on a new power station that uses organic waste material. The project will be completed by the end of the year.
The project is meant to be more than just a power station. It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top. And it's a power park that's silent as well. Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference.
"In Shanghai, we were invited to build -- well we weren't invited; what am I talking about. We won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion. And an expo is a totally bonkers thing. It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened."
"""Jurassic Park"" is a new series on CNN.com's iReport. The series is based on the popular children's book of the same name. This is the first episode of the series, which premieres on Monday, July 16."
"The cathedral is made up of 66,000 seeds that are trapped in a box. The box is made of optical hair that can move in the wind. Inside the cathedral, there are no televisions, no projections, no color changing, just silence."
"The British government is ""the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have,"" says the artist. The project that we're building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer. The mayor of Kuala Lumpur said that, if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city, they would give them more gross floor area."
"The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this. The key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape, rather than engulf it. By linking these together, we could have 90 percent of the site as a rainforest, instead of only 10 percent."
"Chandler was 16 years old when she sprained her wrist during a dance rehearsal. Her arm was discolored, purplish in color, and was cold to the touch. Chandler was treated with an ACE bandage and ibuprofen for a week."
"The touch of a hand, the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on, caused excruciating, burning pain. The muscles were frozen, paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that. How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the flame?"
"The nervous system has plasticity. It changes, and it morphs in response to stimuli. We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time. We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet, and we put them to sleep."
"Pain is often a symptom of a disease, but it can also be its own disease, says pediatrician. ""My philosophy: No pain, no pain,"" George Carlin said. ""The future is actually even brighter,"" he says. ""I have hope that in the future, the prophetic words will be realized"""
"With the sub's lights switched off, it is possible to see their bioluminescence -- the light produced when they collide with the mesh. This is the first time it has ever been recorded. So why would a single-celled alga need to produce light? Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators."
"It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm, and just like the alarm on your car or your house, it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder. There's a lot of animals that use this trick, for example this black dragonfish."
"Most of the animals in our ocean make light. They use it for finding food, for attracting mates, for defending against predators. Some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in ""Avatar,"" but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them."
"Bioluminescence is a phenomenon where light is produced by living organisms. Scientists have spent most of their career studying this phenomenon. The light propagates from stem to plume, changing color as it goes, from green to blue. Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure."
The electronic jellyfish is a bait box with a bunch of isopods all over it. It's just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays. We view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea that uses far red light.
"The world's first deep-sea webcam was installed in Monterey Canyon last year. The camera captured images of a giant sixgill shark, a shrimp and a bioluminescent bacteria. ""We basically have a chat room going on here, because once it gets started, everybody's talking"""
"A 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark tries to eat an electronic jellyfish. A burglar alarm tries to attack what's attacking the jellyfish in Monterey Canyon. A juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long, is also trying to eat a jellyfish on the webcam."
"More than 90 percent, 99 percent, of the living space on our planet is ocean. The first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across. That's the weak form of the knot. If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow, we get the strong form."
"TED Talk: ""Sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else"" ""I lived the same sad life until about three years ago. ... And what happened to me was I bought, what was for me, a very expensive pair of shoes"""
"CNN's John Sutter explains how to tie your shoes. Sutter: There's a strong form and a weak form of this knot, and we were taught the weak form. He shows you how to pull the strands at the base of the knot, so that the bow will orient itself."
The map shows the U.S. from the East coast to the West coast. You can zoom in and out to see different airports and the different patterns that they have. The map was created by the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT. It also shows how airports communicate with each other.
This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab and CurrentCity.org. And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam. So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city.
"Amazon's Mechanical Turk is based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people, but difficult for computers. ""What does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on, and we're just doing these little labors?"""
"There were 662 rejected sheep that didn't meet ""sheep-like"" criteria and were thrown out. The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes. There were 7,599 people that contributed to the project, or were unique IP addresses."
"CNN's John Sutter shows off some of the work he's been working on over the last couple years. Sutter: I'm going to show you a few of the projects that reflect on our lives and our systems. He shows a clip from Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" that he divided into 16 pieces and fed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool. The project was inspired by a project he worked on with a friend."
You can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred- dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project. This is again showing all the different contributions. You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings. And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces.
BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com is a crowdsourcing music-making site. The site allows people to create music without knowing what they're working on. The project was inspired by a Radiohead music video that was shot without using any video.

"The video is a tribute to Johnny Cash's music. It is a time-lapse of the U.S. air traffic system. The video was created by a group of friends and fans of the late singer. The project has raised more than $10,000 for charity."
"The Johnny Cash Project is an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate. ""The Wilderness Downtown"" is an online music video for the Arcade Fire. ""We wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web beyond the four-by-three"""
"Two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible. The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had. The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan, because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit from technologies like this."
"Umar: For the first time in history, not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. In Umar's home country of Nigeria, a 95 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year. Umar: Finishing polio is a smart thing to do, and it's the right things to do."
"Gates: ""We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history"" Gates: ""The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped -- northern Nigeria, northern India, the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan -- they're going to be the toughest"""
"BA: ""We spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year"" ""We're cutting corners, and every time we cut corners, more places get infected that shouldn't have"" ""Hopefully we'll get the word out, and the governments will keep their generosity up"""
CNN.com's John Sutter and Bruce Aylward share an idea that could change the world. Sutter: I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea. Bruce: We made a map to show you exactly where polio still exists.
"Polio is still a devastating, explosive disease. The scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis. This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary."
"Disease eradication, it's still the venture capital of public health. The risks are massive, but the pay-off is absolutely huge. The poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone."
"With polio it's almost completely different. The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease. So you can't see the enemy most of the time, and as a result, we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio."
"Rotary International has been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years. It took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication. By 1999, one of the three polio viruses had been completely eradicated worldwide. Today, there's been a 99 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by the disease."
"Virus started to spread out of northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe. The vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children. The brutal truth is, if we don't have the will or the skill, or even the money, more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year."
"CNN's Jim Boulden reports on the plight of children with polio in Nigeria. He says the disease has left many families unable to work or go to school. The government is trying to find a way to help the children, he says, using satellite images."
"""We are there to take pride and insist on respect,"" she says. ""We are in a position of danger. We pose a threat to the order of the world"" ""We're trying to make a difference in the lives of children,"" she adds."
Iranian artist says he returned to his country after the 1979 Islamic Revolution to find a country that was totally ideological. He says he became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution and the lives of Iranian women. He also says he worries about the West because culture risks being a form of entertainment in the West.
"Iranian filmmaker says he is a ""nomadic artist"" who works in Morocco, Turkey, Mexico. He made a film called ""Women Without Men,"" based on a novel written by an Iranian woman. The book addresses the question of being a female, traditionally, historically in Iran, he says."
"The film is about the Iranian revolution and the aftermath. The director says he wanted to tell a story that transcends politics and religion. The film was shot in Casablanca, Morocco, where the revolution took place. It was released in cinemas across the world on Friday."
"""I take so much inspiration from Iranian women. They have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way,"" she says. ""It's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist, even if I have to operate in the West"""
CNN's Fareed Zakaria: The Kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of Islam. He says the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in Islam. Zakariya: Islam has the potential to create its own way to democracy.
CNN's Fareed Zakaria: Maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed. Zakariya: Westerners who look at Islamic culture should not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains. He says what might look like a problem within Islamic faith might turn out to be a tradition that Muslims have subscribed to. Zakarian: Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culture that became confused with Islam.
"In the Middle East, there is a strong tradition of authoritarianism. The problem is that it is not limited to Islam, but to the whole region. In Turkey, for example, women are forced to wear a headscarf. This is an example of an authoritarian culture."
"Islamic law developed into later interpretations of the Koran, says author. Islam as a monotheistic religion defined man as a responsible agent by itself, he says. The Koran, for example, doesn't condone stoning, and there is no punishment for apostasy."
"Islamic modernism was the dominant trend in the early 20th century among Islamic thinkers and statesmen and theologians. But there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the 20th. century, because we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modernist line. The extreme forms of Islamism led to terrorism in the name of Islam."
"In the early 20th century, the whole Middle East was colonized. This led to a decline in liberal ideas in the Muslim world. The West, particularly the U.S., made the mistake of supporting secular dictators. This made the Islamists in the Middle East more powerful."
"Turkey has never been colonized, so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. In 1950, Turkey had the first free and fair elections, which ended the more autocratic secular regime. The pro-EU process in Turkey in the past decade has become almost an Islamic cause."
"The Arab Spring has been an inspiring example right now for some of the Islamic movements. Democracy is not an overnight achievement; it's a process. And I believe that the Islamic modernism which began in the 19th century, is having a rebirth."
"A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now. The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car. It uses a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot."
"Dennis Hong: ""We're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired"" Hong: The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop. ""We call this the ""backseat-driver problem"""
The AirPix is a multi-dimensional user interface. The simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers. The car was unveiled to the public at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex 24 racing event. The project was part of the DARPA Urban Challenge.
"Dr. Hong: ""You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously"" The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain, Hong says. ""I truly believe that this can happen,"" he says."
"The National Federation of the Blind challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently. The NFB developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility. In the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country."
"If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S., any salary increase will have only a tiny, tiny influence on your well-being. Black people are just as happy as white people are. If you're ugly or if you're really, really good-looking it makes no difference whatsoever."

"Ilyse Hogue has been working on projects that have visible impacts, like a book for a deceased German artist's widow. Hogue: ""Being close to the content -- that's the content really is close to my heart"" Hogue's mother died in January, and pursuing a film like that just seemed the last thing that was interesting."
"The series is based on the artist's own diary. The first part was designed by pigs, the second by a duck, and the third by a monkey. ""I'm not actually here to talk about what we can do,"" says the artist. ""What's the right thing to do?"""
We want the people building the technology to think about what we should be doing with the technology. Let's start with an easy question -- something I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about: iPhone versus Android. How should we figure it out? Let's crowdsource.
"CNN's John Sutter asks whether we should use a Kantian deontological moral framework or a Millian consequentialist one. Sutter: We know more about mobile operating systems, but what we really need is a moral operating system. ""Terrifying, because we have stronger opinions about our hand-held devices than about the moral framework,"" Sutter says."
"How do we figure out what's right and wrong? Maybe we just follow our gut. Maybe we take a vote -- we crowdsource. Or maybe we punt -- ask the legal department, see what they say. We're numbers people, living by numbers. How can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework?"
"Philippine philosopher Plato had the same concerns about right and wrong as we do. ""I don't want opinions; I want knowledge. I want to know the truth about justice,"" he says. ""If you've got two of something, you add two more, you get four,"" he adds."
Plato: What if there were a pure form of justice? What if you could just look around in this world and see which things participated? Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't. It wouldn't be a matter of opinion or just appearances.
"Aristotle thought ethics wasn't a lot like math. John Stuart Mill was a great advocate of this -- nice guy besides -- and only been dead 200 years. What if morals, what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain?"
"It's not like its relation to some abstract form. It's just a matter of the consequences. You just look at the consequences and see if, overall, it's for the good or for the worse. That's the kind of power we have because of all of the data we have."
"phthalmologist: ""It doesn't matter what the calculations are. There are things that are intrinsically wrong"" ""What can we do with just one person's data?"" he asks. ""What's the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do?"""
"Ethics requires thinking. There's not a simple answer. I spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence, trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us. But they can't. We're the ones who have to do it."
"Every person in this room do this: think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing. Go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision. Find an artist or a writer -- or, heaven forbid, find a philosopher and talk to them."
"Humanists think about problems differently than technologists. Humanists become more sensitive to the human considerations, which are crucial to making ethical decisions. The BiblioTech Conference brought together technologists and humanists from around the world. The conference was held in New York City."
"""Apocalypse Now"" is a movie about the end of the world. ""We have so much power today, it is up to us to figure out what to do, and that's the good news,"" he says. ""I can tell with data analysis what you're going to do before you even do it,"" he adds."
"Michael Crichton was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life. The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of ""Jurassic Park"" ""They just keep doing it; they just keep making these things,"" says Spielberg."
"In 1993, scientists attempted to extract DNA from a Tyrannosaurus rex. They found red circular-looking objects, and they looked, for all the world, like red blood cells. They're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone."
"The Hell Creek Project was a massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find, and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them. We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex. It wasn't a very complete T. rex, but it was a very special B-Rex."
"B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone. Mary Schweitzer dumped the bone into acid and found blood vessels left. Schweitzer also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones. She could not find DNA, but did find evidence of proteins."
"                 Found the protein collagen.                 But instead, I go out and I find things.                 Birds are living dinosaurs.                 We don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them.                 Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds."
"The chicken is a dinosaur. The chicken is not. The sixth-graders demand it. So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken. Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools. We'll call them biological modification tools."
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese. We have selection. And we know selection works. We also have transgenesis. That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one. And that's pretty cool.
An atavism is an ancestral characteristic. Snakes are occasionally born with legs. A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth. He was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens.
"In embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand. But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together. We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand."
"When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design. It's a cooler-looking chicken. But it's just the very basics."
"Manual Sola-Morales built a 50,000-square-foot lace net in Porto, Portugal. The net was designed to withstand winds of up to 50 mph. The project took two years to complete and cost more than $100,000."
"Sculpture is being used to create billowing, voluptuous forms on the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world. The material is made from tiny atomized water particles that are shaped by the wind and can be shaped by people who can interact with it."

"Every cell in your body has the same DNA you had when you were an embryo. We can now reprogram your skin cells to act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell. We're entering an era of miniaturization, decentralization and personalization."
"The iPhone 8 will be able to do a lot more than the iPhone 4, says Dr. Andrew Weil. Weil is a professor of medicine at Singularity University in Silicon Valley. The university is looking at how exponential technologies can be used in medicine."
"The ability to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible. We can look inside with real-time fMRI in the brain. And by understanding these sorts of processes and these connections, we're going to understand the effects of medication."
"In the Netherlands, more than 80 percent of medical records are electronic. The handheld ultrasound is surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope. The first FDA-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices."
"We're now in the era of virtual visits, says Dr. Andrew Keen. We can actually now visit our patients robotically, he says. We actually share the same genealogy with Ötzi the Iceman, Keen adds. We already have wireless scales."
"In the future, we'll have wearable devices in our clothes, monitoring us 24/7. There's even mirrors that can pick up your pulse rate. And just like the OnStar system in cars, your red light might go on, and you'll go get it taken care of."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the future of medicine. Sutter: We're now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon. He says we're entering an era of truly scarless surgery, mediated by robotic surgery. The surgeon can see inside the patient, through their lens, where the tumor is."
"Harriet's story is an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary, exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness. ""We're really entering the era of wearable robotics, actually,"" she says. ""By leveraging these sorts of technologies, we're going to change the definition of disability to, in some cases, be superability,"" she adds."
"The future of medicine is going to be much smaller, says Dr. Andrew Weisman. Weisman says we'll be able to send images back and forth from the heart to the brain. He says we're also going to see smaller and smaller pacemakers and blood pressure monitors."
"The genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago, when the first one came out. We're now approaching essentially a $1,000 genome, probably next year. Soon we'll have millions of these tests available. Then it gets interesting, when we start to crowd-source that information."
"We're now entering the era of systems medicine, systems biology. We can capture that information. By looking at the patterns, for example, in our blood, of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test. We'll be predictive and know what you're likely to have."
"Geron: ""We're entering the era of personalized oncology"" Geron started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries. He invented a device called the MarrowMiner, a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow."
"I love contemporary art, but I'm often frustrated with the contemporary art world. I was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public. I'm going to organize it and get it going in the world. It needs to worked on until it can speak fluently."
"""I'm going to make this a real biennial. It's going to be two years of studio work,"" he says. ""It would have ""heart"" in that it would be greatly crafted,"" he adds. ""I grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural Arkansas,"" the artist says."
"I grew up around quirky, colorful characters who were great at making with their hands. I loved this project, getting to play with all the techniques. So for example, in realist paintings, it ranges from this, which is kind of old masters style, to this type of painting."
"""Frost"" is the work of a group of Japanese artists. The piece is called ""Frost,"" which means ""frost"" in Japanese. It's a series of images that show the effects of the sun on the surface of the Earth."
"Gus Weinmueller spends a week at a time with a family. He digs through everything they have, and he finds materials to make work. He spends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is. He shows up on their porch, their doorstep, with a toothbrush and pajamas."
"Sylvia Slater creates pocket-sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them. Her work is called ""Lovemaking Nest"" and ""Mixtape Love Song's Nest"" Her father uses rain to make his art by using birds to make nests."
"""Dig jig"" is where you gather all your friends and family together and you dance on where you're going to be buried. This is in Eastern Tennessee. ""Dig jigs"" are made up of leaves that can be used to make payments."
"Jason Birdsong is interested in how we see as an animal, how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage. He pairs these up with paintings. ""You in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for,"" Birdsong says."
"The U.S. has a long history of using the umlaut as a symbol of power. The U.N. has also used the ulamas as a way to show the power of the umpires. Ulamas are also known as the ""U.S."" version of the U.K. national anthem."
This week's episode of CNN iReport looks at the world of art and culture. CNN's Jarrett Bellini takes a look at the work of some of the world's top artists. He also looks at some of their comments on how over-coddled we've become.
"phthalmologist and optometrist Vera Sokolova is one of the artists featured in the show. The show features works by more than 100 artists from all over the world. The exhibit is part of the Whitney Biennial, which runs through September 28."
"We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave, but we don't need a workers' revolution. What we need is a players' uprising. Today is the start of the uprising. But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution."
"Bulgaria is last in Europe GDP per capita. 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future. Bulgarian President: We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better, for ourselves, for our friends and for our future."
"Communism is about valuing the society and the state over the individual. It squashes creativity, individual self-expression and innovation, he says. The way we apply, generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context, he adds."
"The ""baba factor"" is a social gene running through the U.S. It's 45 years of it that's created what I call the ""Baba factor,"" he says. It takes a long time -- as the redwood trees -- for that serious meme to get out of our operating system."
"The problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution. We need adaptability, the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative. We create robotic workers that we treat like assets, to lever and just throw away. We don't need mechanized workers."
"Bulgarian leader: ""We need a revolution because things aren't working"" ""Play is the catalyst, it is the revolution, that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better,"" he says. ""Our brains are hardwired for play,"" he adds."
"The more you play, the bigger the brains there are. Bears that play more survive longer. Kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially. Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot. But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players?"
"Play has been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala, in the area where it controls emotions. We're designed to do that continuously -- to play and play a lot and not stop playing. We develop better decision-making ability if we play more."
"Play is a genetic birthright that we have, like walking or speaking or seeing. We have this concept that the opposite of play is work. We're last place in Europe in innovation. We hold ourselves back by not playing, he says."
"The opposite of play is not work. It's depression. Play stimulates creativity. It improves our ability to learn. It provides a sense of purpose and mastery. Play doesn't mean frivolous. A doctor might be serious, but laughter's still a great medicine."
"Bulgaria is last in Europe, at the very bottom. Play increases productivity, not decreases. There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play, besides the serious meme that we have to kick out. We shouldn't be feeling guilty."
"Sciant is a Bulgarian company that has been in business for more than a decade. CEO: ""We were able to transform Sciant and, in just three short years, make above average profits for the industry"" ""There's nothing holding us back, except our own mentality about play,"" he says."
"If you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play, he says. ""We're the saddest place on Earth, relative to GDP per capita,"" he adds. ""You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it, your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it"""
"Lunch is like the recess for work. Let them be on the Internet. Give them some freedom, and in general, let them play. We spend so much of our lives at the workplace, and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind?"
"""I want to create endless possibilities with this cello. I become the medium through which the music is being channeled"" ""My first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang. And even though the color was pretty hideous, I did love the car"""
"As a young boy, Ford Motor Company was ""everything that was wrong with our country,"" says Bob Greene. Greene joined the company after college to try to change the way the company was run. He says the company's environmental leanings weren't embraced by those in his own company."
"I was considered a radical. I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists. But today I worry about, what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks? I can see the day where my two great passions -- cars and the environment -- actually come into harmony."
"With more people and greater prosperity around the world, that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century. The average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams. 75 percent of the world's population will live in cities, and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million or more."
"Global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care. We don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots. We need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his childhood love of driving. Sutter: ""I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway, and it was a blast"" ""Very soon we're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other"""
"The potential of a connected car network is almost limitless. The technology will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system. The solution is not going to be more cars, more roads or a new rail system. It can only be found, I believe, in a global network of interconnected solutions."
"CNN's John Defterios: ""I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue"" ""This isn't going to be solved by any one person or one group,"" he says. ""We must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future"" ""We don't want to regress and lose that freedom,"" he adds."
Writer Juan Carlos Cuadrado is a high-functioning autistic savant. His books explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kind of knowing and understanding. He asks readers to consider for a moment the intuitions and gut instincts that are going through their head and heart as they look at them.
"Paintings are in black and white here, but in my mind they have colors. Three is green. Four is blue. Five is yellow. Six is a tiny and very sad black hole. It's not only numbers that I see in colors. Words too have colors and emotions and textures."
"Nabokov was himself synesthetic. And you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out. And this effect is very pleasant on the mind, and it helps the sentence to feel right."
"Icelandic word for ""sad"" is Hnugginn. Some people say it's happy. Most people, a majority of people, say sad. In his theory, language evolves in such a way that sounds match with the subjective experience of the listener."
"John Keats' poem ""Hare"" is about a hare, an ambiguous sound in English. The hare's overlong ears, the overlarge feet, helps us to picture, to feel intuitively, what it means to limp and to tremble."
"Radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers. And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth, we can convert these transmissions into sound. So today, I'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening."
"Alexander Graham Bell was working with Thomas Watson on the invention of the telephone. A half-mile long wire was thrown across the rooftops of several houses in Boston. The line carried the telephone signals that would later make Bell a household name. But like any long length of charged wire, it also inadvertently became an antenna."
"50 years after Watson's encounter with the Sun, Bell and Watson's technology has completely transformed global communications. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space, we have no sense of what space sounds like. Bell employed an engineer to study those noises, to try and find out where they came from."
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were using the horn antenna at Bell's Holmdel laboratory to study the Milky Way. They were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity. A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research. It was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe.
"Joshua Walters: I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness. Walters: There's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive -- at least the hypomanic edge part of it. He says hypomania is like an engine that's out of control, with no breaks."
"There's no such thing as crazy, and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn't mean you're crazy. Maybe it just means you're more sensitive to what most people can't see or feel. Everyone is just a little bit mad. How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum."
"When he was 16 in San Francisco, I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ. I reframe that as a positive because the crazier I get onstage, the more entertaining I become. There's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time. I can't wait to find out."
The Indus people left behind artifacts with writing on them. The Indus script is undeciphered. We don't know what any of these symbols mean. The symbols are most commonly found on seals. But one large sign board was found buried near the gate of a city.
Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle; it's become a question that's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia. The script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people. Some people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient Indo-European language.
The Indus script is the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world. Most of the text that we have is extremely short. All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost. But deciphering the script is a very challenging task.
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a project to decipher the Indus Valley Civilisation. He says the process is complicated, but the results are worth the effort. Defterio: ""It's a very exciting project. It's a really exciting time for me"""
"The Indus script shows a pattern of letters and symbols. If you were to predict the next letter, you would say it would be A. This is because the letters start with the same symbol. It could also be that the letters are connected by a series of letters."
The computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together. The computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases in predicting the correct symbol. There's also practical use for this particular procedure. It could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data.
"The Indus script falls within the range of the linguistic scripts. Language has an intermediate level of entropy; it's neither too rigid, nor is it too random. The DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music occupy the middle range."
The Indus script shares an important property of language. The same sentence written in English and Dutch uses the same letters of the alphabet. The computer found several texts that have very unusual patterns. They were found in present day Iraq and Iran.
"The Indus Valley people used the same script to write their language. They used it to communicate with other people in the region. The question is, how did they do it? And how do we use it to write our own language? That's the challenge."
"In the case of the Indus script, the problem is the reverse. You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense. The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations. In Dravidian languages, the word for fish is ""meen"" which happens to sound just like theword for star."
"The Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century, but the Indus civilization remains silent. The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly. If we decipher the script, we would enable them to speak again."
"In 1969, the Whole Earth Catalog came out. It was a hippie journal of self-sufficiency. In the 1980s, this young doctor, Tom Ferguson, was the medical editor of the Catalog. He saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine is taking care of ourselves."
"When health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease, the key thing that holds us back is access to information. When the Web came along, that changed everything, because not only could we find information, we could find other people like ourselves who could gather, who could bring us information."
"The cancer was in both lungs and had spread to the bowel. The cancer had metastasized from somewhere. The doctor said, ""Just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife"" The cancer is now in remission, but the doctors don't know where it originated."
"Four years ago, CNN's John Sutter found out he was already almost dead. Sutter then found out about what's called the e-Patient movement. ""There's so much about trust -- what sources of information can we trust?"" Sutter says."
"""I didn't feel sick at all. I'd been getting tired in the evening, but I was 56 years old,"" he says. ""I thought, ""What's my mother's face going to look like on the day of my funeral?"""
"CNN's ""This is Life with Kelly Wallace"" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. ET. Wallace's book, ""The Power of Patient Networks,"" is published by Simon & Schuster. The book is about the power of patient networks to help cancer patients."
"CNN's John Sutter is a cancer survivor. Sutter: ""I wish I could have done more to help people with cancer"" Sutter's wife, a cancer patient, painted a mural of her husband's final weeks in the hospital. ""It's a beautiful thing to see,"" she says."
"""Patient"" is not a third-person word. Patients are such an underutilized resource. There's a guy on Twitter that I know, a health IT guy outside Boston, and he wrote the e-Patient rap. ""Gimme my damn data,"" he raps."
"Kelly Young is a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida. She found that a nuclear bone scan that's usually used for cancer can also reveal inflammation. Young: ""If we can get that data out from behind the dam, who knows what we'll be able to come up with"""
"A woman with no medical training had a scan that showed no cancer. She wanted to have it read again, and her doctor fired her. She pulled up the CD of the scan images, and look at all those hot spots. She's now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care."
"The Highline is an old, elevated rail that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan. Mayor Bloomberg wanted to tear it down after 9/11. The project has cost about 150 million dollars so far. The Highline will be open to the public through the end of 2014."
"The High Line opened in 2009. It's been successful beyond our dreams. It has inspired a lot of great architecture. There's a point, you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry, Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban, Neil Denari."
The High Line is a public art project in New York City. The first section of the project is set to break ground in May. The project will include a flyover where people can see the city from the air. The High Line will also be used for public events and events.
"Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch, in 30 days. It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. The goal at first was just saving it from demolition, but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it."
"Hodgman: 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit. Hodgman: There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. In fact, they're a ton of fun. But they're less likely to stick."
"The author took a photo every day for 30 days to document his life. He says he learned a lot about himself through the experience. He also learned that if you want to do something badly enough, you can do it. ""I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work"""
"There are more than 20,000 species of orchids in the world. They have evolved to get their nectar from other plants. The orchid has a long proboscis that it uses to get the nectar. The nectar is then transferred to the next plant."
Insects can mimic plants to get nectar and pollen from the same plant. Insects can see different textures to what an insect might perceive to be different textures. The flowers are a real bugger. They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
The orchid is designed to look like carrion. The flowers don't really have to be that gaudy. They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it. The plant mimics another plant that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
"The philodendron selloum metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals. The plant heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature. The bristles wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen, to pollinate."
"Plants need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches. Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet. Insect beetles love to make love at 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 Centigrade."
"Ilyse Hogue: We don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red. We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind. But we can see what an insect is seeing."
"Bjorn Rorslett sent a picture of evening primrose with an ultraviolet filter. The main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus. Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story."
"""I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness, that the Human Show can stay on the air for millennia to come"" ""I don't know what I had in my mind. I didn't expect that person that I was going to meet to be him. And then we met and we talked, and then I was amazed at what role technology played in your recovery"""
"Simon Lewis has written a book about his experiences in hospital. He has also developed a device that records every step he has taken for six years. The device, called the heel lift, detects when his foot leaves the ground. Lewis says he charges the device every night and it works."
"The Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now. The first generation is exoskeletal, it's wrapped around the leg, around the affected limb. The other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind."
"V.C. Rowling: ""I define simply as the functioning of the brain that is remaining inside my head"" ""There was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect. Everywhere I went, I felt at home,"" she says. "" consciousness is so interesting. It's so unpredictable and so fragile"""
The most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness. consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it's never been under threat before. India has the sad distinction of being the head injury capital of the world. There is no more drastic and sudden gap between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury.
"The third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide. Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents are for concussions. The average teenager sends 3,300 texts every [month]. We're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation."
"The brain is the world's first fully functional quantum computer, he says. ""I felt empty and full, hot and cold, euphoric and depressed because the brain can occupy multiple states at the same time,"" he writes. ""The system has moved me on because, as my family started to discover, there is no long-term concept in the health care system"""
"The author lost a third of the right side of his brain to a stroke. He says the recovery was miraculous, but he didn't think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers. He shares four aspects of his recovery that he believes helped him grow his potential mind."
"The Journal of the National Medical Association published a full review of the book. The book is called ""Cognitive Processing: The Power of the Mind"" The book was published in May 2013 and is available in English, Spanish and French. It is available on Amazon."
"The author's memoir was simply how he found solutions that worked for him. Up to 30 percent of the population have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body. 90 percent of head and neck pain is through muscular-skeletal imbalance."
"""This affected my entire body,"" he says. ""If I ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk, how far would you last?"" ""Behind the glass, they find me"""
"Alfred Mann is the founder of the Alfred Mann Foundation. He uses technology to help the deaf, blind and paralyzed. He says the technology can be used to restore movement in the body. The technology can also be used in the brain to help with memory."
"The concept that they're working towards -- and they have working prototypes -- is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they're needed. The main unit will then go inside the brain. An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex, will send signals in real time."
"Tissue engineers are building enabling technologies for the cells themselves. The flora in our gut may not even be human. Behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his work in the lab. Sutter: ""I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment"" ""What we're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them,"" he says."
Private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies. Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
The U.S. government has been accused of over-spending on surveillance programs. The Obama administration says the program is necessary to protect national security. The government has also been criticized for not doing enough to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
"In China, you have the ""great firewall,"" that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google+ and many of the other overseas websites. The other part of the story are requirements that the Chinese government places on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet. This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable."
"The only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives, not to manipulate or enslave us. The question is, we know how to hold government accountable. We don't necessarily always do it very well, but we have a sense of what the models are."
"The Arab world is moving into a new era of political and social innovation. The Internet is a tool for social change, not just for political change. It's a tool to build a better world for all people, not only for a few."
"The author was born and raised in Essex in the U.K. He says he witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism as distinct from Islam the faith. The author is now working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine democratic culture. ""I believe that hatred has gone global just as much as love"""
"At the age of 17, I was recruiting people from Cambridge University to this organization. I learned how to use email from the extremist organization that I used to be in. Eventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt. But the way in which I learned to use technology to my advantage was because I was within an extremist organization."
"Anti-Islam rhetoric is also on the rise and it's transnational, he says. In certain countries, mosque minarets are being banned. Islamist extremists are also doing the same thing across their own societies. The Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world."
"The Old mentality with a capital O, as represented by the nation-state, not yet fully into the age of behavior, not recognizing the power of transnational social movements, got left behind. I want to share some of that story with you, but also some of my ideas around change."
"There is no equivalent of Al-Qaeda, without the terrorism, for democracy across Muslim-majority societies. There are no ideas and narratives and leaders advocating the democratic culture on the ground. Those who aspire to democratic culture are in power, or have societies that are leading globalized, powerful countries."
"Democracy has become a political choice in Muslim-majority societies, says Peter Bergen. Bergen: ""It would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy as a form of resistance against colonialism"" ""The majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated,"" Bergen says."
Neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply-led approach to impose democratic values from the top down. Islamists and far-right organizations have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots. And what's needed is a genuine transnational youth-led movement that works to actively advocate for democratic culture.
"What's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself. Democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric, but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship. To get to that stage, we genuinely need to start building demand in those societies."
"Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British. It's a rich source of vitamin B12. Archie Cochrane gives half of the men under his care vitamin C. He gives the other half vitamin B 12. After just a few days, it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness, marmite is the cure."
"CNN's John Sutter tells the story of a British doctor who became a prisoner of war in Germany. He says the doctor, Archie Cochrane, suffered from the God complex. Sutter: ""No matter how complicated the problem, you have an absolutely overwhelming belief you are infallibly right"""
"The world is simply far too complex to understand in that way. I see it in our business leaders and the politicians we vote for. The problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that Archie doesn't really understand. I mean, have a look at this graph. It's the Second World War."
"Cesar Hidalgo has used network analysis to analyse 5,000 different products. He says his work will be useful in understanding how economies grow. Hidalgos: If you wanted to count every product and service on offer in New York -- there are 10 billion of them -- would take you 317 years."
"The complexity of the world is unbelievable, he says. We tend to retreat and say, ""We can draw a picture, we can post some graphs, we get it, we understand how this works,"" he adds. But we don't. And we have a problem-solving technique that works."
" evolutionary theory is based on trial and error, he says. It's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trials and errors, he adds. ""People do terrible things in wars,"" he says, ""because they don't know what they're doing"""
Professor Steve Jones explains how Unilever solved the problem of how to design a nozzle. Jones: You take a nozzle and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle. You try out all 10; you keep the one that works best.
"The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy, says David Frum. Frum: Trial and error is far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize. He says the process of trial and error explains the incredible performance of Western economies."
"Timothy Stanley: Trial and error is a good thing. Stanley: It's so hard to admit our own fallibility. He says Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody. Stanley says we need to abandon the God complex, but it's so uncomfortable."
"Archie Cochrane wanted to test out the question of where patients should recover from heart attacks.

"The PC virus problem is 25 years old now. We have to find the people with the skills, but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good. That's much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls."
"Virus writer Basit and his brother Amjad wrote the first PC virus in the 1980s and 1990s. The brothers have had their computers infected dozens of times by unrelated other viruses over the years. ""Think about everything it has brought us. Think about all the services we use, all the connectivity"""
"Virus infections are a global problem, according to researchers at the University of California, San Diego. The number of new examples of malware we find every single day is growing, they say. Today, viruses are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers, but by professionals."
Virus writers are making money by infecting computers. They use keyloggers to record everything you do on your computer. They then sell the data to criminal gangs. The number of viruses on the internet is growing. There are tens of thousands of them on the web.
"We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime. Once you gain access to other people's credit card information, you can just go online and buy whatever you want. We know that online criminals are hiring programmers, hiring testing people, testing their code."
"Criminals use the global nature of the Internet to their advantage. They will switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another. So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world."
"The code has been encrypted with XOR function 97. The code also contains a mysterious string, which says O600KO78RUS. That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature. It's not used for anything."
A Russian man in his early 20s drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower. The license plate of the car he crashed into is O600KO78RUS. Brain.A. is a five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain A.
"In most online crime cases, we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from. Even if we are able to find online criminals, quite often there is no outcome. The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence."
"Brain: Everything is reliant on computers working. We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail. I see beauty in the future of the Internet, but I'm worried that we might not see that. Online crime is one thing that might take these things away from us."
"""We are running a risk of losing it all"" if we don't fight online crime, he says. ""The self that I attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again"" ""How many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place?"""
"From about the age of five, I was aware that I didn't fit. I was the black atheist kid in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns. The journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one. It's given me an insight into the whole notion of self, which I think is worth sharing."
"At 16, Thandie Newton earned her first acting role in a film. At 19, she was a fully-fledged movie actor, but still searching for definition. At university, she applied to read anthropology, and was asked, ""How would you define race?"" She said, ""Skin color"""
"The self is a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death. We all stem from Africa -- in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve who lived 160,000 years ago. And race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance."
"The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator -- to you and to me. When I'm acting a role, I inhabit another self, and I give it life for awhile, because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment. The thing that was a source of shame was actually a Source of enlightenment."
"""I'm not ashamed of my self. In fact, I respect my self and its function,"" he says. ""If we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life, then we're devaluing and desensitizing life"""

"The SmartBird has a wingspan of about two meters. The length is one meter and six, and the weight is only 450 grams. Birds are very agile. They fly, not with rotating components, so they fly only by flapping their wings."
"Markus Fischer: We have a split wing. We get the lift at the upper wing, and we get the propulsion at the lower wing. The overall consumption of energy is about 25 watts at takeoff and 16 to 18 watts in flight. We have to turn it, go up and go down."
"Rory Stewart: What we look for in firemen, in climbers, in policemen, is intelligent risk takers. The worst thing we have done in Afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option. Rory Stewart: If we can often do much less than we pretend, we can do much more than we fear."
"We should have stuck to the U.N. resolution, he says. We could have done a no-fly zone within 48 hours, he adds. We've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council, and we're setting ourselves up for failure."
"It is extremely unlikely the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country. Even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong, it's extremely unlikely they would invite back Al-Qaeda. This isn't the 1990s anymore. It's simply not true that what went wrong in Afghanistan is the light footprint."
"When we began to bring more money into Afghanistan, things got worse, not better, he says. It's not simply corruption and waste that you create; you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government with the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours, he adds."
"The putting-in of troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it, he says. Rather than preceding the insurgency, the Taliban followed the troop deployment. The last 20 years has been the age of intervention, and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy."
"In 2004, U.S. President George W. Bush said he would deliver the ""decisive year"" in Afghanistan. In 2009, Bush's successor Barack Obama said he'd deliver ""the year of the president"" In 2011, Obama said the U.K. would deliver ""a year of national unity"""
"The first thing we need to change is the structures of our government. The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months. In the British embassy in 2008, an embassy of 350 people, there were only three people who could speak Dari, the main language of Afghanistan."
Bosnia-Herzegovina is one of the most troubled countries in the world. The war in the region began in 1992 and ended in 2003. The conflict has been largely won by the international community and the Bosnian people.
"In Bosnia and Kosovo, a lot of the secret of our success was the humility of our engagement. We criticized people a lot in Bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals. But that slowness turned out to be a strength, and it helped us to put our priorities right."
"Cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people, creating ideas, innovation, wealth and so on. You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue. The amount of preparation you can do is limited -- you can take some water, you can have a map."
"Cities are expanding at an exponential rate, says David Frum. He asks: Is this what the world will look like in 2050? Frum: There is a need for a theory of cities that can be applied to the 21st century."
"Aims to explain why life is so resilient and robust -- scalability is one of the main reasons it's so resilient, he says. ""You could drop an atom bomb on a city, and 30 years later it's surviving,"" he adds. ""We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles"""
"Cities are the origins of global warming, impact on the environment, health, pollution, disease, finance, economies, energy -- they're all problems that are confronted by having cities. You grow very quickly and then you stop. This is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us."
"The bigger you are systematically, according to very well-defined rules, less energy per capita. Despite all of that Darwinian evolution and natural selection, they've been constrained to lie on a line. Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe, there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this."
"All of life is controlled by networks -- from the intracellular through the multicellular to the ecosystem level. Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions, our interactions, and the clustering and grouping of individuals. The tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization."
"There is an economy of scale. Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are. It scales in the same way everywhere. Two hundred years ago, the United States was less than a few percent urbanized. It's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on."
"The bigger you are, the more you have per capita, unlike biology. The exponent, the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate, is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2. This 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet."
"Every week for the foreseeable future, until 2050, every week more than a million people are being added to our cities. The bigger you are, life gets faster. This is what we had in biology, just to repeat. Economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior."
"Innovations are necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse, he says. The catch, however, to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and fast, he adds. The question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings, avoid a heart attack?"
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the pleasures of everyday life in the United States. Sutter: Companies are dominated by economies of scale, not by super-linear innovation and ideas. He also looks at Goering, who was a terrible man, but was also an amicable psychopath."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at why we are so obsessed with the origin of our art. Sutter: ""It's always better to own an original than a forgery"" He says that in this case, the original was a painting by Dutch artist Frida Ghitis. The original was later found to be a fake."
"Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II, his designated successor. Goering fancied himself a collector of art, like Hitler, and liked to collect artworks. He says our response to things is conditioned on our beliefs, about what they really are, what they came from."
"Studies show that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff, it tastes better to you. They get people into a fMRI scanner and while they're lying there, through a tube, they get to sip wine. Parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree."
"Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido. Capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion. People have murdered those that they loved, believing that they were murdering an imposter. Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any of them."
"Golf clubs owned by John F. Kennedy sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction. Britney Spears' bubble gum was chewed up by pop star and sold for several hundreds of dollars. According to an unconfirmed report, a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes."
"""I love the work of Chagall. But I don't want a duplicate, even if I can't tell the difference,"" he says. ""I want something that has a specific history. In the case of artwork, the history is special indeed"" ""You've washed away the Clooney cooties"""
"The value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation. The original is typically the product of a creative act, the forgery isn't. I think this approach can explain differences in people's taste in art."
"Violinist Joshua Bell was asked to stand in a D.C. subway station and make money. Bell made 32 dollars in three-quarters of an hour. He actually made 20 dollars more than that, but he didn't count it. He was charged with the crime of treason."
"The first example from music is from John Cage's modernist composition, ""4'33"" ""How you think about what you're experiencing, your beliefs about the essence of it, affect how it hurts,"" says van Meegeren. ""For a dollar 99, you can listen to that silence,"" he says."
"The World Bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars to address malnutrition in those countries. When a leader says, ""Not under my watch,"" everything begins to change. The world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this."
"Inevitably, food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person, nation by nation. We have to stand together. We want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted, but that exists no more."
"""This is not a negotiable thing, hunger. People have to eat. This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain,"" he says. ""This isn't one of those rare diseases that we don't have the solution for,"" he adds."
"Every 10 seconds we lose a child to hunger. This is more than HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. If a child in its first thousand days does not have adequate nutrition, the damage is irreversible. There was enough food on Earth for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories."
"In the first six months of life, less than three percent of children in the world are breastfed. This is a huge gap that needs to be bridged. We need to teach children how to feed themselves and their families. We also need to educate them about the importance of breastfeeding."
One billion people on Earth don't even know how to fill this cup. The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding. Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net. I am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods.
"The World Bank is providing food to children in war-torn countries. The food is often provided by small farmers. Girls are more likely to go to school if there is food in the house. The money is spent on education, not on war."
"Cameroon, northern Cameroon, has had cycles of hunger every year for decades. Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons. Instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks. For the past two years, 500 villages have not needed any food aid."
"""What if we view them as the solution, as the value chain to fight hunger?"" he asks. ""We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up 240 percent"" ""It is a win-win situation that starts the food economy moving,"" he says."
"Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries. 80 percent of food aid is bought in the developing world. In Brazil, President Lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day. The zero hunger program costs .5 percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people."
"We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening, but we're not very good at it. The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared. The cost of malnutrition and hunger is on average six percent, and in some countries up to 11 percent, of GDP a year."
"We're becoming desensitized to the subtlety of human conversation. We retain just 25 percent of what we hear, so we need to learn how to listen better. The first step is to learn to listen with your ears, not with your mouth."
"Listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear? How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to? You can do it in a beautiful place as well, like in a lake. It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening."
"This is playing with those filters. This is listening positions -- the idea that you can move your listening position to what you're listening to. And finally, an acronym. The acronym is RASA, which is the Sanskrit word for ""juice"" or ""essence"""
"Every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart. We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal, and especially our name. Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters. Let's get listening taught in schools, and transform the world in one generation."
"By the end of this year, there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites. Some services are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die. ""I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists,"" Ostrow says."
"As machines' ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve, it's going to become possible to analyze an entire life's worth of content. One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter. MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans."
"Derek K. Miller was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer. Miller's family and friends wrote a post that went out shortly after he died. ""All of us today are creating an archive that's something completely different than anything that's been created by any previous generation"""
"You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights. In hospitals, they are security issues. These radio waves penetrate through walls. They can be intercepted, and somebody can make use of your network. But on the other hand, we have 14 billion of these: light bulbs, light."
"The U.S. has 10,000 times more of the radio waves spectrum than the visible light spectrum. The spectrum has created us, has created life and created all the stuff of life, he says. It's inherently safe to use, he adds."
"LED light bulbs can be modulated at very high speeds. Technology can also be used to replace the remote control of a light bulb. The technology creates a simple, low-speed data stream in 10,000 bits per second. With these mobile phones, we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data."
Scientists have developed a visible light demonstrator. The light goes through a hole in an LED light bulb. It is then converted back to a high-speed data stream. The researchers hope to integrate the light into smart phones in the future.
" wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water. The light beam transmits a video, a high-definition video that is transmitted through that light beam. Even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver. It can ignore that constant light, because all the receiver's interested in are subtle changes."
"Lights in the hospital, aircraft and smart phones are potential sources for high-speed data transmission. If the whole world would deploy them, you would save hundreds of power plants, he says. ""We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now,"" he adds."
"Light can be used to transmit wireless data. The applications of it, to me, are beyond imagination at the moment. In hospitals, for new medical instruments; in streets for traffic control. In a petrochemical plant, you can't use RF, but you can use light."
"Every street lamp could be a free access point for wireless data. Cars have LED-based headlights, and cars can communicate with each other. There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin, and each of these lights could become a potential transmitter."
"Mark Ridley: If language really is the conduit of our cooperation, in our modern world, we confront a question. Ridley: The question is whether in this modern, globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages. He says nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist."
"Mark Pagel: Do we have any idea how we could have defeated Neanderthals if they also had language? Pagel says genes alone don't, all by themselves, determine the outcome of very complicated things like language. He says our languages exist to prevent us from communicating."
Chimpanzees don't learn by copying others. They use the same tools over and over again. This is because they don't have the social skills to learn from others' mistakes. It's the same with humans. We don't know why we use different tools.
"Homo erectus showed very little change over the 300,000 years or so that those species, the Neanderthals, lived in Eurasia. We can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do. And as a result, our ideas do accumulate, and our technology progresses."
"When you speak, you're actually using a form of telemetry not so different from the remote control device for your television. And the reason that dilemma arose is, it turns out, that social learning is visual theft. If I can learn by watching you, I can steal your best ideas, and I can benefit from your efforts."
"Language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation. ""We take this utterly for granted, because we're a species that is so at home with language,"" he says. ""Just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit, language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit"""
"Homo erectus evolved 200,000 years ago and spread around the world, occupying nearly every habitat on Earth. Homo erectus is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised."
"Currently, there are about seven or 8,000 different languages spoken on Earth. The greatest density of different languages on Earth is found where people are most tightly packed together. If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea, we can find about 800 to 1,000 distinct human languages."
"The European Union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their 23 official languages. The EU employs a permanent staff of about 2,500 translators. In 2007 alone, 1.3 million pages were translated into English alone. The Tower of Babel story in the Bible is a fable and warning about the power of language."
"Researchers looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated and outdoor air. They found that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans. It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth, our spit. The health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States."
"Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings. Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems. The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans, and with the human-built environment. The aim is to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside."
"""I began to see my body like a thing, a thing that could accomplish other things, many things, all at once"" ""I didn't have patience for my body; I snapped it into shape. If I was tired, I drank more espressos"" ""If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places"""
"The more I talked about my body, the more objectified and fragmented my body became. My stomach was proof that I had not measured up, that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect. My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting away from it."
"The author went to the Democratic Republic of Congo to hear stories of rape. She says the stories ""saturated her cells and nerves, and to be honest, I stopped sleeping for three years"" The rape of the Earth, the pillaging of minerals, the destruction of vaginas ""none of these were separate anymore"""
"Cancer ""exploded the wall of my disconnection"" from the world, says writer Philip Shepherd. Shepherd: ""If you are divided from your body, you are also divided from the body of the world"" ""The fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests"""
"In the name of connectedness, the only thing my mother wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico. And gratefully, it didn't. A few weeks later, I was in New Orleans and this beautiful, spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me."
"Eve Ensler: ""The honey in the water made it sweet, it was the oil that made it sick"" ""It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world,"" she says. ""I learned it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves"""
"The author says she lived in the city for years because she was afraid of trees. ""I never had babies because heads cannot give birth. Babies actually don't come out of your mouth,"" she says. ""It was all these things in the water, in the world, in my body. It was energy, love and joy,"" she writes."
"Men prefer the company of other men to women. The problem is that men don't know the difference between making love and doing porn. Men also like to play video games, which lead to more sexual activity. Men don't like to be left out of the action."
"The porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America -- 15 billion annually. The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week. For every 400 movies made in Hollywood, there are 11,000 now made porn videos. The effect, very quickly, is it's a new kind of arousal."
"Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys. In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls. The old fear of rejection is being replaced by a fear of intimacy. The new fear is that people are afraid to be alone with others."
"Every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants. Denseer places tend to have lower emissions. Increasingly, we don't even need to densify an entire city. What we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don’t drive as much and so on."
"When you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn't use any of them really, you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as 90 percent. And people are embracing this. People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood."
"The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes in its entire lifetime. Buildings are becoming bundles of services. We're finding that people can share the same spaces, do stuff with vacant space. And in fact, even space itself is turning into a service."
"Vancouver is trying to become a ""sustainable city"" with green infrastructure, says Mayor Gregor Robertson. Robertson: ""If we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities, we need to think a little differently"" ""It's not about the leaves above, it's about the systems below,"" he says."
"""We're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve"" climate change, he says. ""By mid-century, we're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people living in cities"" ""We will be an overwhelmingly urban species,"" he adds."
"11 years ago yesterday, the phone rang in the penguin office at the New England Aquarium. Estelle van Der Merwe called from SANCCOB, saying, ""Please come help"" More than 12-and-a-half thousand volunteers came from all over the world."
"""I was truly distressed to know that every day, animals were being wiped off the face of this Earth forever"" ""We were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least I was"" ""The amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there"""
"The Apollo Sea rescue in '94 was a huge success, but the Treasure rescue was less successful. In the six years between these two oil spills, they've built thousands of well-ventilated boxes. The first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the Apollo Sea spill."
Penguin oil is used to clean the bodies of dead birds. The oil is then used to create new penguin oil. The new oil can be used to make new penguins. It is also used to keep the penguins alive.
The African penguin was declared endangered one year ago. They could be extinct in less than 10 years if we don't do something now. The two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming. The Penguin Lady's mission is to raise awareness and funding to protect penguins.
"Penguins have been threatened by oil drilling in South Africa. The oil has polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population of African penguins. Humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins, but we are now their only hope."
"""There was no starting point for peace. There was no day of intercultural cooperation,"" he says. ""If we united and we interculturally cooperated, that might be the key to humanity's survival"" ""I wanted it to be the 21st of September because it was my granddad's favorite number"""

"In 1999, the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence was held in Geneva. The event was attended by thousands of people, but no press were present. ""For me, it was really about the process. And that's the beautiful thing about the camera,"" he says."
"Kofi Annan, Dr. Oscar Arias and Salim Ahmed Salim were among those who supported the idea of creating a global peacekeeping force. In the last 12 years, Kofi has visited 76 countries and recorded 44,000 young people. Kofi: ""I'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them"""
The film was inspired by the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day. The Costa Rican government and the British government put forward the idea to the United Nations General Assembly. The idea was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world.
"Kofi Annan was invited to do a press conference on September the 11th. The statement was never made. The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence. ""We have to continue this journey, and we have to tell people,"" he says."
"Jude Law is a British actor and director. He is best known for his role in the film ""Jungle Book"" He is now working on a new film, ""Afghanistan,"" based on his experiences in the country. The film is based on a true story of the conflict in Afghanistan."
"""I could never raise awareness by myself, no matter what I'd achieved,"" says Jude Law. Law: ""You've got to get everybody involved here. You can't just expect it to work"" ""I've been messing around with a camera most of my life,"" Law says. ""There was an interest in what was going on"""
The film was made in the wake of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. The film was shot in Dari and Pashto. It was released in time to coincide with the start of the World Health Organization's polio vaccine campaign.
"In 2008, ISAF announced it would not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of September. The U.N. Department of Security and Safety said violence was down by 70 percent. ""I kept thinking about this 70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do"""
"On the 21st of September this year, we're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena to go for that process, to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities. And we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition."
"CNN's John Defterios sat down with Brahimi to talk about the possibility of a global truce. Brahimi said it was ""absolutely possible"" Defterio: ""It's all about the individuals. It's not about you and me"""
"The face of the Sun has freckles. These are called sunspots, and they are just one of the manifestations of our Sun's magnetic field. They also cause the light from the star to vary. We can measure this very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects."
"Kepler searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars, all at once, every half hour. In just over two years of operations, we've found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems. In the previous two decades of searching, we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler."
"The Chinese general Sun Tzu said that all war was based on deception. Now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women. We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses, says the author of the book, The Art of Deceit."
"Imitation is a form of self-deception, he says. ""Art is a deception that creates real emotions -- a lie that creates a truth,"" Debussy said. ""When you give yourself over to that deception, it becomes magic,"" he adds."
"Marco Tempest: ""I like to think of myself as an honest magician"" ""I use a lot of tricks, which means that sometimes I have to lie to you,"" he says. ""A magician promises to deceive you -- and he does,"" he adds."
"When running experiments, scientists hope that one group will behave differently than another. One person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance was actually performing terribly. The experimenter was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample. He pulled the whole mean down, destroying my statistical significance of the test."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about how to deal with conflicts of interest. Sutter: ""We don't see that we are doing things in a way that is not in our best interests"" Sutter says we need to be more aware of the ways in which we are contributing to problems."
"DNA expert: ""What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white? What would happen then?"" ""We have lasers; we can whiten it out,"" he says. ""This is coming from a Jewish guy, all right, so that means a lot to me"""
"The two human DNA sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently. If you look outside Africa, you actually find less genetic variation. This is surprising, because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in Africa than outside Africa. Modern humans evolved in Africa, quite recently, between 100 and 200,000 years ago."
"From a genomic perspective, we are all Africans, says evolutionary biologist. Genetic variants are generally distributed widely in the world, in many places, and they tend to vary as gradients. A project is underway to sequence a thousand individuals -- their genomes -- from different parts of the world."
"Human traits are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world. Genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters A, T, C and G. The information is there twice -- one on each strand -- which is important, because when new cells are formed."
"The Neanderthals are thought to have lived in southern Africa. The Neanderthal population is believed to have been around 2,000 years old. They are believed to be the ancestors of the modern-day humans. They lived in the region of what is now southern Africa, which is part of Europe."
"Researchers have found evidence of a link between Neanderthals and modern humans. They found a piece of bone in a cave in the Altai region of Siberia. The bone was from a Neanderthal who lived around 640,000 years ago. The DNA was found to be similar to that of modern-day humans."
"Modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa, came out of Africa, presumably in the Middle East. They meet Neanderthals, mix with them, continue to spread over the world. Somewhere in Southeast Asia, they meet Denisovans and mix withthem. And then these earlier forms of humans disappear, but they live on a little bit today in some of us."
"The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot. They're large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long. They are embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors. The next one looks at passive nature, or programmability."
"A NAND gate gives you an output in 3D space. So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down. On the right-handside, [0,0] input is a 1 output,. which goes up. The structure contains the exact blueprints."
"In the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years of assembly time, 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass. So what does this tell us about the future? I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair."
"Yudhisthira: We have exciting machines that can take us into space. But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds. DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour."
"Avalokiteshvara: ""I want to address the issue of compassion"" ""I know those hands and eyes; they touched me as well,"" he says. ""Some of them are fierce, some are wrathful; some are tender,"" he adds. ""And that woman did not have sentimental compassion"""
"The Dalai Lama once said, ""Love and compassion are necessities. Without them, humanity cannot survive"" compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering. compassion activates the motor cortex, means that we aspire, we actually aspire to transform suffering."
"CNN's John Sutter talks with Eve Ensler about the power of compassion. Sutter: ""We have a society, a world, that is paralyzed by fear. And in that paralysis, of course, our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed"" ""Many of us think that compassion drains us, but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us"""
"The generation of compassion mobilizes our immunity. Why don't we vote for people in our government based on compassion? In Buddhism, we say, ""it takes a strong back and a soft front"" The archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin."
"Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered, unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is. They have infused societies with kindness, and we have felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half."
"Women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men, she says. The women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire, she adds. ""May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere,"" she says at the end of the speech."
"In the ancient world, doctors were conscious of what they could and couldn't do. Even now, our choices are having unintended consequences, says Dr. David Perry. ""I've learned that they're really the essence of what makes for progress,"" he says."
"TED Talk: Unintended consequences play a part in how technology is developed. The first hackers were the telegraphers of the mid-19th century. Mark Twain was a big investor in the Paige typesetter, which had 18,000 parts. The most brilliant idea could fall apart, even when judged by experts."
"Titanic was an example of how safety technology could be a source of danger. The Eastland, a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915, killed 841 people. The 20th century saw how much more complex reality was, but it also saw a positive side."
"In 1976, it was discovered that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters. In the early 1980s, there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the United States. IBM, which made them, just didn't know what to do. So they reformulated the bactericide."
"The Great Depression was the greatest decade for fundamental innovations. Chester Carlson, the inventor of the Xerox copier, was not intending to work in patent research. He was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions. Benjamin Graham developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in 1929."
"We need to learn from Dr. Cushing, who killed patients in the course of his early operations. He had to have some errors. And he learned meticulously from his mistakes. The message, then, for me, is chaos happens; let's make better use of it."
"The smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is, in fact, a single cell -- a bacteria. ""What is life? Is biology special? Is matter evolvable? ... If we answer those questions in reverse order, then we're going to know how special biology is,"" he says."
"""It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden,"" he says. ""When I saw this, I was really fascinated, because it seemed lifelike"" ""I was positive that, if somehow we can make things mimic life, let's go one step further,"" he adds. ""Let's see if we can actually make life"""
The quest to make life started four billion years ago on planet Earth. The cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing. Synthetic biologists are manipulating it. Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease. We're awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards.
"Darwin: ""We have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life, we need to power it somehow"" ""There's been four billion years of organic, biological life. And we went through a variety of worlds. And from this stuff we came"""
"We don't know how we got to the last ancestor. Evolution kicked in -- and that's the cool bit. But there's a roadblock that you can't get past. So there are two options: intelligent design, direct and indirect -- so God or my friend."
"Inorganic, dead matter into living matter, into inorganic biology. The key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away. And the answer, of course, lies with mice. ""I imagine you have a similar thing in cellular biology with the emergence of life"""
"The idea is to make a set of molecules that are the same size as a cell. The cells are made up of three or four different types of molecules. They are then put together to form a single cell. This is a very simple way of making a cell, but it could be used for other purposes."
"""I love things that are alive. And that is the key to this project,"" he says. ""If we can get these molecules to talk to each other, they will start to replicate themselves. And we can then use that to create new forms of life"""
"Scientists are working on ways to fuse artificial cells with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with. If this works, the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level, and we really start talking about selfish matter. ""We should take our inspiration from biology"""
"Cronin: ""If we can make inorganic biology, that will in fact define life"" ""We're proposing to do it in just a few hours, once we've set up the right chemistry"" ""It's a very exciting time for us,"" Cronin says. ""I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds"""
"Cronin: ""If we were able to create life that's not based on carbon, maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for"" ""I celebrated every religious function,"" Cronin says. ""I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani"""

"India has the right institutional conditions for economic growth, whereas China is still struggling with political reforms. I believe that the political reforms are a must for China to maintain its growth. I don't know whether that's going to happen or not, but I'm an optimist. Hopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report that political reforms will happen in China."
"Oxford-trained economist discusses economic growth in China and India. He argues that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth, rather than a facilitator of economic growth. The key question is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered growth, he says."
"Country 1 has a systematic advantage over Country 2 in infrastructures. Country 1 has more telephones, and Country 2 has a longer system of railways. Since 1989, the country has performed at a double-digit rate every year for the last 20 years. If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union, you would have made a poor prediction."
"Until the late 1990s, China had an infrastructure disadvantage vis-a-vis India. The evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth. The economy grows, government accumulates more resources, and the government can invest in infrastructure."
"Economic expert: East Asian economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the 60s and 70s and 1980s. One reason is the East Asian Model, he says. For each successful authoritarian government in East Asia, there's a matched failure, he adds."
"In the last 30 years, in terms of the GDP growth rates, China has grown at twice the rate of India. The advantage the country had was human capital -- nothing else but human capital. The adult literacy rate in China is 77 percent as compared with 48 percent in India."
"As early as 1965, China had a huge advantage in life expectancy. The contrast in literacy rates is especially sharp between Chinese women and Indian women. In the last five years, the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth. But over the last 30 years, China undoubtedly has done much better than India."
"By 2006, India has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy. 60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women in the coastal part of the country, whereas in India, it's all men. India still has a long way to go to catch up with China."
"China's political system has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic. The pace of political changes in China is too slow, too gradual. India's political reforms have not moved further and faster on political reforms. The country is going to face some substantial challenges, because they haven't moved further."
"The Chinese government is recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities, says Chris Anderson. Anderson: ""We need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people"" ""If we rely, as we do at the moment, solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences, we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame,"" he says."
Chris Anderson talks to Misha Glenny about the hacker group Anonymous. Glenny says the group is ideologically driven and claims to be fighting a dastardly conspiracy. He says Anonymous is providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting data.
"The hacker is central to many of the political, social and economic issues affecting the Net. Despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions, hundreds of billions of dollars, into cybersecurity, no one wants to talk to the hackers. The Hackers Profiling Project is doing some fantastic research into the characteristics of hackers."
Hackers Anonymous are a politically motivated hacking group. The criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals. Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details. This is the first time so-called off-the-shelf malware is being used.
"Misha Glenny: CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals. Glenny spoke to one of these Carders who we'll call RedBrigade. He explained how he would go on sprees in New York, taking out $10,000 from an ATM."
"RedBrigade is a group of cyber criminals based in Ukraine, Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka. The group's founder, Dimitry Golubov, was born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982. He developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the 1990s."
"Renu Rajan was an eight-year-old Sri Lankan refugee seeking political asylum in Britain. He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud and will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London in 2012. Max Vision, aka ICEMAN -- mastermind of CardersMarket.com, was one of the best penetration testers working out of Santa Clara, California in the late 90s."
"Hackers like Cagatay Evyapan, aka Cha0, have characteristics consistent with Asperger's syndrome. Adewale Taiwo, aka FreddyBB, ran a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in 2008. Gary McKinnon -- who is wanted by the United States for hacking into the Pentagon -- suffers from Aspergers."
"The ""Talk to Yourself"" hat is a way for people to talk to each other without speaking. It is made of a variety of materials, including wire, plastic and metal. It was created to help people who are struggling to communicate with others."
The Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves. The Discommunicator is a tool for arguments. The Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say.

"Artist, technologist and educator June Schubert is working on a project to improve human-glacier relations. She created a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit. The suit is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice."
The Human Genome Project aims to sequence the entire human genome. The project is funded by the National Institutes of Health. The goal is to sequence all of the human genome by the end of the year. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed by the summer of 2015.
"The world has the capacity to sequence 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year. Beijing Genomics Institute represents 20 percent of that capacity. The Chinese are ""absolutely winning this race to the new Moon,"" says CNN's John Sutter."
"The Beery twins were diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two. Their mom didn't believe it; the symptoms weren't matching up. Joe Beery, who was the CIO of a company called Life Technologies, got his kids sequenced."
"Nick, a young boy with a distended belly, had his genome sequenced. He had a single-point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death. The gene that regulates that down is broken. Nick underwent a bone marrow transplant and now eats steak with A1 sauce."
"Technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought, of flood, of pests and pesticides. As long as we continue to increase the population, we'll have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods."
"CNN.com's John Sutter asks readers if they've ever had a DNA test. Sutter: ""I have never had one, and I'm not going to have one"" He says there's already an app that can test for the so-called ""cheating gene"""
"Experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child. ""These genomes, these 23 chromosomes, they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society -- at least not yet,"" he says."

"""We have the capacity to laugh and cry. That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom,"" says author. ""I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders,"" he adds. ""It's a very strange thing to be able to do that"""
"In 1960, most people watch TV for inspiration. In 2010, moral ambiguity is on the wane. Over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows are exported around the world. ""We like it. We like some parts of it,"" says one TED speaker."
"Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years. The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day. In 1970, inspiration plummets. But in this case, we have comfort in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green."
"""Gunsmoke"" and ""Gomer Pyle"" in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows. ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In"" was the first show that allowed viewers to say, ""My God, I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War"""
"""All in the Family,"" ""Sanford and Son"" were top-rated shows in the 70s. ""Six Million-Dollar Man"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" were also in the top 10. ""The Bionic Woman"" was the top-ranked show in the 1970s."
"In 2001, the September 2001 television season, humor succumbs to judgment once and for all. The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor -- we're watching ""Friends,"" ""Frasier,"" ""Cheers"" and ""Seinfeld"""
"There has not been a decade of television without a definitive, dominant TV mom. Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s. Maude Findlay, the epitome of the irreverent 1970s, tackled abortion, divorce, even menopause on TV."
"TEDWomen: ""I don't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience, sitting on television's shoulders"" ""I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral, political, social and emotional need states of our nation"" ""The West may collapse very suddenly.

"In 1500, the average Chinese was richer than the average North American. By the 1970s the average Briton was more than 10 times richer. The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon, Bruno says. It has just accelerated this huge shift, he says."
"Empire was the least original thing that the West did after 1500. Most of that went to the motherland, not to colonial possessions. The Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s, some considerable time after decolonization."
"""We conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions,"" he says. ""We took all the Germans, we divided them roughly in two, and we gave the ones in the East communism, and you see the result"""
"TED Talk: Six killer apps that set the West apart from the rest of the world. There are six which I think explain the Great Divergence. One, competition. Two, the scientific revolution. Three, property rights. Four, the role of religion in society."
"In 1500, there were a hundred different political units in Europe. The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation, existed in the 12th century. Property rights: It's not the democracy, folks; it's having the rule of law based on private property rights."
Most people in rural North America owned some land by 1900. That's not possible in Latin America where land is held onto by a tiny elite. Modern medicine in the late 19th century began to make major breakthroughs against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.
"The work ethic is no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon. The average Korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average German. 19 percent of the world's population today, Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth. The gap between Shanghai and the United Kingdom is as big as the gap between the U.S. and the UK."
"The average American used to be more than 20 times richer than the average Chinese. Now it's just five times, and soon it will be 2.5 times. Economic historians call this ""The Great Divergence"" It's our generation that is witnessing the end of Western predominance."
Ai Weiwei is a Chinese dissident who has been detained in China for months. He is accused of violating the country's human rights laws. He has been released on bail and is expected to return to China in the coming days. He says he wants to help his country develop its democracy.
"Researchers have digitized five million books, including 500 billion words. Authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions, publishing books. When written out, the text would stretch from here to the Moon and back 10 times over. The books contain a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome."
"LA: We're going to tell you how many times a particular four-gram appeared in books in 1801, 1802, 1803, all the way up to 2008. That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used. We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books."
"The ELA has assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard, MIT, The American Heritage Dictionary, The Encyclopedia Britannica and even our proud sponsors, the Google. What you're seeing is year by year frequency of ""thrived"" and ""throve"" over time. The entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide."
"Erez Lieberman Aiden: Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. JM: You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram, and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead, although you might agree that he might need a better publicist.

"Jean-Baptiste Michel: A reasonable expectation is that somebody's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after. Michel: We found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words. But guess what, nobody will really care."
Culturomics is the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture. It's kind of like genomics. Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome. Culturomics uses digitized pieces of the historical record.
Google's Ngram Viewer allows users to search for words by their n-gram. Users can also browse examples of all the various books in which their word appears. The site was used over a million times on its first day. The Ngram is a tool that can be used by anyone to learn about words.
"Google has started to digitize 15 million books. That's 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published. It's a sizable chunk of human culture. There's much more in culture: there's manuscripts, there newspapers, there's things that are not text."
"Donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost, but their customers don't buy the branded versions. The private companies that sell condoms in these places understand this. Their marketing is slightly different, but the imagery sure is. Some brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative."
"In the past 10 years, five million people have died due to a war in the east. The HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults in the DRC. Only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need."
Tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline. Concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within 20 to 30 years. The disease was first sighted in the northeast of Tasmania in 1996 and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.
"In the area where she comes from, more than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease. Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer. But they now know that this cancer is not spread by a virus. In fact, the infectious agent of disease is something altogether more sinister."
"Cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes. Once established, natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer. Cancer could be thought of as a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end."
Jonas is a Tasmanian devil with a large tumor on his face. Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you. Jonas' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body. The tumor in Jonas probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devils.
"The Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer. It spreads through the population, has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system. It's the only cancer that we know of that's threatening an entire species with extinction. But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils, why hasn't it happened in humans?"
"Cancer cells that are affecting Kimbo are also found affecting dogs in New York City, in mountain villages in the Himalayas and in Outback Australia. Genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old. It may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the Neanderthals."
Cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments. But that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer. Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer.
"Doodling is an incredibly powerful tool, and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn. People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information. Doodling has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing."
"The doodle is considered to be anti-intellectual and counter to serious learning. Doodling engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience. Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form, it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy."
"In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool. To do nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work. We're losing a ritual that is transformative, transcendent, and is at the heart of the patient-physician relationship."
"Sir Joseph Bell was a teacher in Edinburgh. He was inspired by the story of Sherlock Holmes. He asked a woman about her child. She said she had left him with her sister. He said, ""Would you still be working at the linoleum factory?"" She said yes."
"In the late 1800s, a doctor in Paris started using a stethoscope to listen to his patients. The device was originally used to test the strength of a patient's blood. It was later used to monitor the health of the patient's organs."
"Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate, who then established the Tate Gallery. The arrival of auscultation and percussion represented a sea change, he says. The barber pole, the red and white stripes, represents the blood bandages of the barber."
"Patient's perception of the best medical care is often at odds with his or her own. ""The real patient often wonders, where is everyone? When are they going to come by and explain things to me? Who's in charge?"" he asks. ""And the one critical piece missing is that of the patient"""
"A patient who had been treated at a cancer center in Texas said she was disappointed that they didn't touch her breasts. The patient went to a private oncologist, who examined both breasts and the axillary tail. The doctor said that to the patient, it spoke of attentiveness that she needed."
"""I have never been examined like this before,"" the patient said. ""I remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and I had slipped back into a primitive ritual,"" the doctor says. ""If I ever get to heaven, it will be because I held my piece for 45 minutes,"" he says."
"Rituals are terribly important. They're all about transformation. We signal the passage of a life with rituals. We marry to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery to one of eternal bliss. I'm not sure why you're laughing. That was the original intent, was it not?"
"The new school will have 300, 400 pupils aged 14 to 19. It will be independent of the public system, funded by public money. The school will focus on work and learning, rather than sitting in a classroom. The students will be able to work on commission with NGO's."
"Pupils learn best by doing things, they learn best in teams, he says. It's an idea for a new kind of school, which turns on its head. And all at no extra cost, no selection, and allowing the pupils the route into university."
"Studio School aims to transform the way teenagers learn by putting practical skills at the heart of learning. The idea came from an organization called the Young Foundation, which has come up with many innovations in education. It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it, and spread through word of mouth."
"""I was playing the violent African, the African terrorist. And I was thinking, how many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself?"" he says. ""I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana. And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality, though a fragile reality"""
"In 1957, Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence. In the late 50s, Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP. Today, Singapore is a First World country and Ghana is not. But maybe it was time to prove to myself, it's important to look at it in a different light."
"The early 70s marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana. But by the end of the decade, the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement. ""Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself,"" he says."
"Ghana found itself in the same place in which the U.S. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections -- Bush versus Gore. Instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide, Ghana honored democracy and its people."
"""I wanted to blend in. I think it was a tactic of survival. And it worked,"" he says. ""I'm still here. I'm still in the country. And I'm not going to leave. I am still here"""
"Gillian McKeith is our TV diet guru, giving out very lavish and exotic health advice. She boasts that she's a certified professional member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants. She also says things like eat lots of dark green leaves, they contain chlorophyll."
" Epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you. An Australian study in 2001 found that olive oil, in combination with fruits, vegetables and pulses, offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings."
"People who eat fruit and veg and olive oil are freaks -- they're not normal, they're like you. For a host of fascinating, interlocking social, political and cultural reasons they're less likely to have wrinkles. Trials are old; the first one was in the Bible, Daniel 1:12."
"The placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine. It has this bizarre, ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer. We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment."
"Trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo. But in a lot of situations that's wrong; often, we already have a good treatment. You can get licensed to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it's better than nothing."
"Risperidone, the first of the new-generation antipsychotic drugs, came off copyright. Industry-funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials. The negative data goes missing in action; it's withheld from doctors and patients."
"There are two different ways you can spot whether some data has gone missing. You can use statistics or you can use stories. I prefer statistics, so that's what I'll do first. A funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared, have gone missing in action."
76 percent of all trials that were done on reboxetine were withheld from doctors and patients. The Nordic Cochrane Group were trying to get ahold of the data on that to bring it all together. Around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld.
"Picking the evidence behind dodgy claims isn't a kind of nasty, carping activity; it's socially useful. This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today. The infectious diseases Cochrane Group has been trying to get the full data in a usable form from drug companies."

"CNN's Jim Boulden talks to a 20-year-old Chinese woman about social media. He asks her what she thinks of the world and what she wants to do with it. She says she is proud to be a member of the Red Cross, but she's not sure why."
"Microblog boomed in the year of 2010, with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled. About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people, under 30 years old. Most of them were born in the 80s and 90s, under the one-child policy."
"In urban areas, college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month. Young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old. Among the 200 million migrant workers, 60 percent of them are young people."
"Last year, 13 young workers in a southern manufacturing compound in China committed suicide. The incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation of these migrant workers. Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand, says Liu. Liu: The bitterness and resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread."
"China is soon to pass the U.S. as the number one market for luxury brands. Half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.K. dollars. Young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making. But sometimes they're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life."
"Happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years. People are thinking about the following questions: Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP? How are we Going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth, to keep sustainability and stability?"
"""We can make life in the computer. Granted, it's limited, but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it"" ""Life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be"" ""If we remove the mystery of life, then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live"""

""It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase,"" Sutter adds."
"""What on Earth is artificial life?"" is a question many people ask. ""Well, of course, you'd go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.A.,"" says Hawking. ""And then you might come up with something like this,"" he says, ""and it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts"""
"Steen Rasmussen created the first truly artificial living system. The Tierra system is a tree of life that looks very much like the type of life we're used to. Rasmussen: ""These things don't evolve by themselves. In fact, they have hackers writing them"""
"There's about 10,000 programs sitting here. And as you see here, there are groups that are growing on top of each other. Any time there is a program that's better at surviving in this world, it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction."
"Scientists are trying to create a biosignature based on life as a universal process. ""I would like to find out how I can distinguish text that was written by a million monkeys, as opposed to text that is in our books"" ""I'm telling you, this is very robust across English texts"""
"Scientists have been able to detect meaning in the biomolecules that make up life. The theory is based on a set of building blocks, like the alphabet. Scientists have found that amino acids and other carboxylic acids are the building blocks of life."
"The Avidians are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity. They have about 28 of these instructions. And if you have a system where they're being replaced one by the other, it's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter. Some instructions that are extremely valuable to these organisms are going to be high."
"""I'm going to show you a little experiment that we did. And I'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high that even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world, if you drop it in, it gets mutated to death immediately. So there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate"""
"Life is not something that is so special to Earth, but that, in fact, could exist anywhere. Less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint, he says. He started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions."
"We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives. We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time. By all means, we should buy and own some great stuff. But we want stuff that we're going to love for years."
"Life Edited is a new series on CNN.com and CNN iReport.com. This week, Jarrett ponders the benefits of an edited life. In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render, we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space."
"Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago. With all this extra space, we'd think we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff. But there's a new industry in town, a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry: personal storage."
"TED Talk: What goes into making toys and tools that we use every single day? It's mostly many types of plastics and many type of metals. Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff, if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals."
There's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel. metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another. Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range. They have different electrical and magnetic properties.
"CNN's John Sutter takes a look at some of the methods used to recover plastics. Sutter: Plastics are ""far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke"" He says people in slums try to separate the plastics by color, shape, by feel, by any technique they can."
"The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals. This is the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth. Because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules, we're using a mining approach to extract the materials."
"The process starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits. We take out the things that aren't plastics, such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber, wood, glass, paper, you name it. We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail."
"""We're producing it from your old stuff, and it's going right back into your new stuff"" ""Mother nature wastes very little, reuses practically everything"" ""If it's broken, it's my stuff."" ""I hope I've changed the way you look at some of the stuff in your life"""
"The United Nations estimates that there's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year. That number well more than doubles when you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth. The more developed the country, the bigger these mountains."
"Berkley: If we want open-mindedness, open learning, creativity, innovation, we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children. Half the time, a baby would act as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli -- just like a baby."
"18-month-old babies have already discovered that we don't always want the same thing. This suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep, profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old. The question you might ask is: Why do children learn so much?"
"New Caledonian crow babies are fledglings. They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years. So they're very, very good at pecking for grain, and they're not much good at doing anything else."
Babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species. The baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet. We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use.
Reverend Thomas Bayes was a mathematician in the 18th century. Bayes used probability theory to describe the way that scientists find out about the world. And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now.
"Researchers have found that four-year-olds are better at learning about the world than adults. They used a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others. If you wave a block over the top of the detector, the detector will actually activate two out of three times."
"Studies show that four-year-olds are better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are. Children do experiments we call it ""getting into everything"" or else ""playing"" AG: We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this profound thing about other people."
"A three-year-old boy can test five hypotheses in two minutes, says psychologist Cristine Cristine. ""Babies, after all, can't talk, and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what you'll get a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays"""
"I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults. We have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention. Babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing. But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources."
"Forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it. Because if I can get that right, I can make them wonderful. And you know what those products and services are, because you own some of them."
"When he was little, the designer discovered that there was something that did exactly that -- light to dark in six seconds -- exactly that. ""I don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it. I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation,"" he says."
"CNN's John Defterios writes about the power of the human mind. He says it can be used to make the world a better place. But it can also be used as a tool to make us feel better about our lives, he says. Defterio: ""It can be a tool for us to make a difference in the world"""
"This is the last act on this Earth of a little girl called Heidi, five years old, before she died of cancer to the spine. It's the last thing she did, the last physical act. And I'm watching your faces, because your faces are telling me something."
"The designer says beauty is not just about nice, it's about how people react to it. He says the OMG face is not an expression of joy, but of something else. The OMG is a big emotional response, often quite a sad emotional response."
"Pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing. And as we assemble these tools, from a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it, because these are things, as we've already said, they're arriving at the brain, it would seem, before cognition, before we can manipulate them."
"""I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if I look at that eye. And the earhole isn't doing it to me at all,"" he says. ""This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension,"" he adds. ""I'm not in the least bit religious, but at that point, I noticed something happening"""

"""I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics,"" he says. ""There's so little compromise on this, you can't see it,"" he adds. ""I've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter"""
"It's that easy to lose beauty, because beauty's incredibly difficult to do. It takes a central cortex, if you like, to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time. This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty, as long as you know what water is like."
"Do we actually think beauty, or do we feel it? Is it possible to pick up beauty through feeling, rather than thinking? Is there a difference between a ballet dancer's toes and the toes of a human being? What do you think? Share your thoughts in the comments below."

"Ian Ritchie developed the first hypertext markup language in the late 80s. The system was capable of doing very, very large documentation systems over computer networks. In 1990, Ritchie was approached by Tim Berners-Lee about writing a browser for the World Wide Web."
"In 1992, Tim Berners-Lee's paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference. The very next year, in 1994, he was the keynote speaker at the conference in Edinburgh. He says he's in company with people who turned down The Beatles and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter. But on the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen who wrote the world's first browser."

"Lying can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Lying can compromise our security, undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths of those that defend us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the United States."
"Lying is an attempt to connect our wishes and our fantasies with what we're really like. On a given day, studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers."
Lying is woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do others. Women lie more to protect other people. Lying is as old as breathing.
"Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species. The more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. One-year-olds learn concealment. Two-year's bluff. Five-year’s lie outright. Nine- year-olds, masters of the cover-up."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the ways in which people lie about themselves. Sutter: ""There are good liars and bad liars. We all make the same mistakes"" Sutter says the best way to avoid lying is to be honest with yourself and others."
"Pamela Meyer: What were the telltale signs of a liespotter? Meyer: People who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language. We know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool."
Lying is hard. You have to look people in the eyes to tell if they're lying. Don't overdo the Botox; nobody will think you're honest. You've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door. The real smile is in your eyes.
"An honest person is going to tell you the truth. They're going to be willing to give details. They'll be infuriated if they don't. An honest person will tell the truth, even if it's hard to hear. They won't lie, but they won't sugarcoat."
"John Edwards shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock. He said he'd be happy to participate in a paternity test. ""I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine, because of the timing of events,"" he said."
"When anger turns to contempt, you've been dismissed. The expression of contempt is marked by one lip corner pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt, whether or not deception follows, look the other way, go the other direction."
"CNN's John Sutter shows you how to spot a lie. Don't try to be like those folks on ""Law &amp; Order"" and pummel their subjects into submission. Look, listen, probe, ask some hard questions, Sutter says."

"The Infinity Burial Project uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies. ""We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food,"" says the project's founder. ""It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife"""
"Mushrooms are a type of organophosphorus plant. They can be used to create new organs. They are also used to make new organs, such as lungs, hearts, kidneys and lungs. The idea is to use them to create a new kind of organ, a new body."
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift from death denial and body preservation to a radical acceptance of death and decomposition. Accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment. The survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet.

"Barefoot College will be a college only for the poor. The college will teach skills that are never brought into the mainstream. ""What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college,"" says the college's founder. ""I'd like to share a 45-year-old love story with the poor,"" he says."
"Barefoot College is the only college in India where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's, you are disqualified to come. You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out to come to our college. You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floors, you work with your hands."
"Barefoot College is the only college in the world that doesn't give a certificate. There are no contracts, no written contracts, and no one can get more than $100 a month. ""You come for the work and the challenge, you'll come to the Barefoot College"""
Barefoot architects of Tilonia got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002. The women at the college refused to share the technology with the men. The college is fully solar-electrified and powered by 45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.
"Barefoot College in India uses solar power to power 60 meals a day. The college is connected to a 400,000 liter tank, so no water is wasted. The women who make the solar cooker are almost half German, they're so precise."
"60 percent of children in Tilonia don't go to school, because they have to look after animals. Over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools. The prime minister is 12 years old. She looks after 20 goats in the morning, but she's prime minister in the evening."
"In India, where the percentage of illiteracy is very high, we use puppetry. Puppets are the way we communicate. If there's tension in the village, if attendance at the schools goes down, the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says, ""Shake hands"""
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to India, Afghanistan and Ladakh. He says he learned that men are untrainable, restless and want a certificate. The best way of communicating in the world today? Television, he says. Defterio: Tell a woman."
"The first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan was set up by three women. The women have trained 27 more women and solar- Electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan. ""I came back home, told my mother, ""I'd like to live and work in a village"""
CNN's Jim Boulden visits Sierra Leone to learn more about the country's solar power system. He says the country is the first in the world to use solar power to generate electricity. The country is also one of the first to use radio frequency technology to power the grid.
"The code that's in every single one of our 50 trillion cells that makes us who we are and what we are. If we just take one cell's worth of this code and unwind it, it's a meter long, two nanometers thick. Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness."
"Carbon at the nanoscale is transparent and flexible. It's a thousand times more conductive than copper. To change its state, by the way, takes two volts from a millisecond pulse. The total width of it is 600 times smaller than the width of a decimal place."
"The power plant of tomorrow is no power plant. We want to talk about storing energy, and unfortunately the best thing we've got going is something that was developed in France a hundred and fifty years ago, the lead acid battery. We went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas, and we gave them this diagram."
"EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside, hold it until you need it, and then be able to release it and pass it off. The grid of tomorrow is no grid, and energy, clean efficient energy, will one day be free."

Body-powered prostheses were invented just after the Civil War. They were refined in World War I and World War II. We want to develop tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out EMG signals.
"The state of the art is what we call myoelectric prostheses. These are motorized devices that are controlled by little electrical signals from your muscle. They work pretty well for people who have just lost their hand, because your hand muscles are still there."
Scientists have developed a robotic arm that can open and close its own hand. The arm has six degrees of freedom and can be controlled by a remote control. The technology could be used to help people who have lost the use of their own limbs.
"When you lose your arm, that nervous system still works. Those nerves can put out command signals. We're using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals. Muscles will amplify the nerve signals about a thousand-fold, so we can record them from on top of the skin."
A man had both his arms amputated after he touched the wrong wire. He now has a prosthetic arm that he can use to move his arm around. The prosthesis can also be used to control the arm's movements. It's the first time the prosthesis has been used on an adult.
"Jesse has been fitted with a prosthesis to replace his missing arm. He is learning to use the prosthesis, but still needs to learn how to use his hand. Scientists are working to get motor commands to drive robotic arms in the future."
"Researchers have developed a way to give a missing hand sensation back. The skin on the missing hand is deinnervated to give the hand sensation. The hand sensation can be felt in both the hand and the chest. Amanda Kitts, the lead researcher on the project, explains how the device works."
"Amanda Kitts lost her arm in a car accident in 2006. She had targeted reinnervation surgery, took six more months to have all the reinnervations. Then she was fitted with a prosthesis. The prosthesis was a little slow, and it was just hard to work."
Over 50 patients around the world have had this surgery. The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high. It's like 96 percent. The most important thing is our patients have appreciated it. We greet with our hands. It provides intuitive control.
Researchers have developed an algorithm to help people move their hands more easily. The technology is called pattern recognition. It can be used to teach people how to use their hands in new ways. The research is being carried out at the University of New Brunswick.
"It took about three to four hours to get it to train. It's about seven pounds, which is probably about what my arm would weigh if I lost it right here. If it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it. We've also had Amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms."
"Amanda is using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation. The arm has a hand that can do different grasps. There are also some children who are born without arms, called congenital limb deficiency. It's all about pattern recognition, says Dean Kamen."
"phthalmologist uses weather data to create new types of prosthetic limbs. He also uses natural reed to help him translate the data into different shapes and sizes. He says it's a lot of work, but the results are worth it in the end."
"Ilyse Hogue's work challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science. Hogue: Every single color, dot, every single line, is a weather element. Together, these variables construct a score. I use these scores to collaborate with musicians."
"Hurricane Noel's barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007. The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data. Every single bead, every single colored band, represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note."
"Income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them. I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in rich developed market democracies. The measure we've used is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country."
"The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems. The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth. That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world."
"In the U.S., trust in the government is higher than in the rest of the world. The World Values Survey looked at the relationship between trust and income. The survey also looked at trust in health care, education, and the economy."
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year. It goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others. This is violence. The relationship is not mainly driven by more crime. But most of it is about more punitive sentencing.
"In the U.K., fathers' income is much more important than in Scandinavian countries. The countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones. The Nordic countries and Japan seem to have the best social mobility. The U.S. has the worst."
"Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on. Japan is rather different though. It starts off with much smaller Differences in earnings before tax. It has a smaller welfare state. And in our analysis of the American states, we find the same contrast."
"Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy. The biggest differences are at the bottom of society. But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society. The study looked at educational outcomes and health in the U.S. and internationally."
"Stress hormones, responses to doing stressful tasks, measured. Researchers looked at tasks that included social-evaluative threat. Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress. The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another."
"Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top. I think the take-home message is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes. I should say that to deal with this, we've got to. deal with the post-tax things and the pre- tax things."
Bombers used to have to drop bombs from a height of thousands of feet. Now they can do it from a distance of just a few hundred feet. The technology is called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight. It has all kinds of levers and ball-bearings.
"Norden's bombsight allowed the U.S. military to hit targets at 20,000 feet. The project cost $1.5 billion, half the amount spent on the Manhattan Project. ""It was like manna from heaven,"" Norden says of his invention."
"The U.S. military buys 90,000 of these Norden bombsights at a cost of $14,000 each. They trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them. The bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft."
"The Norden bombsight was used in the Second World War. It was designed to fly at low altitude. But in real life, it can't do that. The Norden bomb was used to make bombs for the war effort. It can't fly at high altitudes."
"The Norden bombsight was designed by Carl Norden, a Swiss engineer. The Nazis used the bombsight during the Second World War. The bombsight didn't work very well; only 10 percent of the bombs landed. The Pentagon says it can now put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft."
"Carl Norden was born in 1880. His mission was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers. After the war was over, he asked: How many Scuds did we actually destroy? And the answer was not a single one. The issue was they didn't know where the Scuds were."
"The CIA has used drones to kill 2,000 suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants. ""We think we're now at 95 percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes. That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare"""
"On August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay flew over Japan and, using a Norden bombsight, dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of Hiroshima. Meanwhile, back in New York, no one told Carl Norden that his bombsight was used over Hiroshima."
"Cancer is like a ""post-it"" note: it remembers that it's cancer. Scientists are trying to make a molecule that prevents the Post-it note from sticking. The molecule, called JQ1, was developed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute."
"Cancer cells were changing shape when treated with JQ1. The next step would be to put this molecule into mice. The molecule is so potent for this protein target, it's a perfect fit of shape complementarity, or hand in glove. The cancer cells -- small, round and rapidly dividing, grew these arms and extensions."
"There's no mouse model of this rare cancer. The mice with this cancer that get the drug live, and the ones that don't rapidly perish. As we treat it with our compound, this addiction to sugar, this rapid growth, faded."
"The drug is used to treat multiple myeloma, an incurable form of cancer. The drug is made from a type of fat that can be removed from the body. It's being tested in the U.S. and Europe, but is still in development."
"Harvard Medical School professor: ""We know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever before"" ""We have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet. It's not orally bioavailable. We need to fix it so we can deliver it to our patients,"" he says."

"Paul Saffo: ""I thought I could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral"" ""I tried it on some colleagues. One of them told me, that is the world's stupidist idea,"" he says. ""I countered, ""Well men's brains make this too"""
"In the early 2000s, a study found that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous. In his lab, he tempts people with virtue and vice by using money. ""If you're so virtuous, show me the money,"" he says."
"In a test of trust, two people give money to each other. The money is then transferred to the second person. The second person receives the money. The first person is left with the money, and the money is returned to the first person."
"Researchers found that the more money the second person received, the more their brain produced oxytocin. Researchers used an inhaler to measure the level of oxytocins in the brain. Researchers found that those on the drug showed more trust than those on a placebo."
"Oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent. We showed it increases donations to charity by 50 percent. Non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin include massage, dancing and praying. People willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers. But why do they do this?"
"Adam Smith was a moral philosopher, and he was right on why we're moral. He said we're social creatures, so we share the emotions of others. Knowing that molecule is valuable, because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off."

Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel. It's so easy to cause people's brains to release oxytocin. We have found that people who release more Oxytocin are happier. And they're happier because they have better relationships of all types.
The Transition is a light sport aircraft that can carry 110 lbs. It is the first of its kind to be approved by the FAA. The aircraft can be flown by a pilot with as little as 20 hours of flight time. The FAA has given the company an exemption for the aircraft to be certified.
"CNN's John Defterios takes a behind-the-scenes look at the U.S. Air Force's new high-tech plane. He says the plane is designed to be used for off-road driving, not just flying. The plane has a continuously-variable transmission and a liquid-based cooling system."
"The Terrafugia Transition has an automated wing-folding mechanism. The wings are fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight. The first deliveries to the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane should begin at the end of next year."
"The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes. There are thousands of local airstrips that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could. Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger, park it in your garage."
"The Terrafugia Transition is a two-seat, single-engine airplane that works just like any other small airplane. So why is it that we move the particular ways we do? Maybe we don't all quite move the same way. Maybe there's variation in the population. And maybe those who move better than others have more chance of getting their children into the next generation."
"The brain is there and evolved to control movement. The fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise. There are many diseases which effect movement. And hopefully if we understand how we control movement, we can apply that to robotic technology."
"The brain is a very complex organ, says the evolutionary psychologist. He says it's important to understand how movement plays a key role in the development of the brain. ""You have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision,"" he says."
"I believe movement is the most important function of the brain -- don't let anyone tell you that it's not true. How well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement? And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly; it's a very hard problem. I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room, it would win every time."
"Robot can pour water into a glass, but it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human. Robot can also stack 12 cups against the clock in real time, but that's another three-year program. There is no generalization at all from one task to another in robotics."
"In my group, what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement. And it sounds like an easy problem. You send a command down, it causes muscles to contract. Your arm or body moves, and you get sensory feedback from vision, from skin, from muscles and so on."
"CNN's Richard Quest explains how the brain works. He says the brain has to deal with a lot of noise and uncertainty. Quest: ""You want to generate beliefs about the world. So we're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one"""
"Bayesian decision theory gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs. ""I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful. And it has real beauty and real explanatory power,"" he says."
The brain is designed to produce adaptable and complex movements. We learn about the world but also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is. The brain makes predictions of the sensory feedback it's going to get in the future. It profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do.
"You might have a little predictor, a neural simulator, of the physics of your body and your senses. As you send a movement command down, you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions. If I've got a good predictor, it predicts the same thing."
"The human body is made up of a series of muscles. These muscles are used to move objects in a certain way. In this video, we see how these muscles work together to create the sensation of a tickle. We also see how they react to different types of light and sound."
" Neuroscientist says the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations. He says the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes, and you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant. He hypothesizes that when one child hits another, they generate the movement command."
"The game is very simple. We use a motor to apply force down to player one's fingers for three seconds and then it stops. And that player's been told, remember the experience of that force and use your other finger to apply the same force to the other person's finger."
"There is a 70 percent escalation in force on each go. So it really suggests that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it's producing. We all move the same way pretty much, so there's a big gap between the task and the movement system."
We store our information as DNA in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring. Life also has a kind of inheritable information. If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism -- we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate.
"We use this idea called self-assembly. I can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab, and these chemicals will start to self-associate to form larger and larger structures. We can use these, as they say, to form the body of our protocell."
"Scientists have blurred the line between non-living and living systems. But a living system must be able to use energy to maintain itself, like living systems do. Scientists have developed a new model of a protocell that can use energy in a dynamic way."
"The system has a body, it has a metabolism, it can use energy, it moves around. It can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself. This is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior."
Scientists have been mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures in the lab. They hope the new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems. The new structures could have something to tell us about the origin of life on the Earth.
"The origin of life would have looked like this: junk that is present on the early Earth, 4.5 billion years ago. So the challenge then is to make some protocells with lifelike properties from this primordial ooze. These are also, these tar-fueled protocells, are also able to locate resources in their environment. They become very energetic, and able to find the resource in the environment."
"Life has to be in non-equilibrium, in liquid form, in a form that can exploit energy from the Sun to maintain itself. Life also has to convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself. The next work is a sound-sensitive installation called ""The Pygmies"""
"Phenomenon is a series of short videos created in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors. Each video features a different type of pygmy creature, each with its own personality and personality. The creatures hide behind panels on the wall, and when it's silent, they creep out from behind the panels. They react to background sounds, but react to foreground sounds."
"Pors and Rao were intrigued by the notion of invisibility. They developed a camera that could look at people in the room, track them and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible. They found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them."

"CyArk is a foundation dedicated to digital heritage preservation of world sites. To date, with the help of a global network of partners, we've completed close to fifty projects. The data can be used to develop 3D models that are very accurate and very detailed."
"""We're losing our sites and the stories, and basically we're losing a piece of our collective memory,"" he says. ""In order to continue our work, we need to develop new technology,"" he adds. ""We need to be able to use the new technology to preserve our history and culture"""
"CyArk is a 3D scanning company based in the San Francisco Bay Area. The company has been working on a project to digitally preserve a Ugandan heritage site. The site was destroyed by a fire in March, but the data is now available to the public."
"The brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making -- it's the last to mature in late adulthood. With two mirrors, the scanner calculates the beam's horizontal and vertical angles. The point is then recorded into a 3D visualization."
"Human brain is one continuous processing unit, if you will. It's cells and it's wires all wired together. There's about 86 billion neurons in our brain. How they're distributed really contributes to their underlying function. And of course, since we can now start to map brain function, we can start to tie these into the individual cells."
"Each neuron is connected via synapses to up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain. Each neuron itself is largely unique. The unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry."
"The project is seeking to look at this readout, understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on. The first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what's called an MR. imaging. We're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue."
"The brain is removed from the skull, and then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices. These are frozen solid, and they're shipped to Seattle. The next thing we do is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging. This maps the large cabling in the brain."
Scientists use old-fashioned technology to create detailed maps of a brain. They melt a microscope slide and then melt it onto a robot that applies stains to it. Scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what's called laser scanning microdissection.
"We take tissue, we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology, and then we put a florescent tag on it. We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray. Each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome."
The MR tool provides a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on and off. The red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree. Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on. Each gene gives us a fingerprint.
"Scientists can now see where genes are turned on by drugs. Proteins are targets for drugs, so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off. Scientists can scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint. It's as interesting a side effect as it could be."
"The human brain is very similar to the rest of the body, says Dr. David Wheeler. Wheeler: ""It's important to show that we are not so different that we can't communicate with each other"" He says the human brain has a lot of similarities with other parts of the world."
"phthalmologist: ""This is truly an unexplored, undiscovered continent"" ""These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type,"" he says.

The Swiss airline pilot says he has to adapt to something new every time he takes to the skies. He has to improvise when it comes to landing on his wings. He also has a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons: so he can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that on his head.

"It takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day. One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it. It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home; it's going skiing."
"Scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible. The daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor. Part of it's on the outside, and it's catching the hormone as it comes by. The other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell."
"Daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and IGF-1. Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal. IGF- 1 promotes growth. These functions were known for these hormones for a long time, but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about."
"Hormone pathway in flies, mice and humans is an ancient one. People who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations. These changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted."
"In the daf-2 mutants, a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues, and repair damage. The way that they're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO. FOXO turns on a number of genes, including antioxidant genes that help other proteins to function well."
"The daf-2 mutant has genes that prevent FOXO from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is. This prevents the genes from being turned on, which is why the worm lives longer. Many of these genes, we've shown, actually contribute to the long lifespan of the mutant."
"Scientists have found that certain forms of the FOXO gene have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100. FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people. If they exist and you can find them, then maybe one could eventually do something about it."
Researchers are trying to develop drugs that will activate a protein that affects lifespan in people. mutations that damage the TOR gene -- just like the daf-2 mutations -- extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice. There's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein.
"The drug would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity. If you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal. There are other ways of activating FOXO that don't even involve insulin or IGF-1 that might even be safer."
"There are some creatures on this planet that don't really do aging. Nobody knows if they really can live forever, or what keeps them from aging. mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2 doubled the lifespan of the little worm."

"Asteroid was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth. Video cameras were just starting to become popular, and parents would bring them to their kids' football games to film their kids playing football."
"In 1908, a huge rock blew up over Siberia. The explosion caused a huge shock wave that wiped out hundreds of square miles of forest. The rock was about the size of the Macky Auditorium in New York City. It's not clear what caused the explosion, but it was huge."
"20 megatons are very rare, but they are still a potential threat. If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere, it would cause a panic. The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock, and that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air. A chunk of rock six miles across, moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet, slammed into the Earth."
"The asteroid Apophis blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago. NASA has devoted money to this; the National Science Foundation and other countries are interested in doing this. We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat. If we see one heading toward us, we have to stop it."
"Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004. It's going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029. The odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million, roughly -- very, very low odds."
"In 2005, NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact, which slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet. The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way; the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet."
"The B612 Foundation is a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts. B612 is a six-mile-wide rock that lived on an asteroid called B612. ""The Little Prince"" was based on the asteroid, which is located in the asteroid belt between Earth and Mars."
"If we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth and we have enough time, we can hit it to move it into a better orbit. The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe, and the probe has a couple of tons of mass. You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it, although that's a whole other thing."
"We invented something called an ion drive, which is a low-thrust engine. It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand. It can run for months and years, providing that very gentle push. Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push."
The robot can be controlled by a computer or a person. It can also be moved by the user with almost no force. The robot is named Rezero after the dinosaur that hit the Yucatan Peninsula. It is not yet clear whether the robot will be used in the future.
Rezero was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at ETH-Zurich. It works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of Rezero. With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way.
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor. He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately. The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis.

"Researchers: 33 percent of all of our regrets pertain to decisions we made about education. Others very high on our list of regrets include career, romance, parenting, various decisions and choices about our sense of self. Financial decisions account for less than three percent of our total regrets."
The author says regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways. The first consistent component of regret is basically denial. The second characteristic is a sense of bewilderment. The third is an intense desire to punish ourselves. The fourth is a real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret.

"Newborn babies can't do much, but one thing they're really good at is sucking. Researchers rigging up two rubber nipples so that if a baby sucks on one, it hears a recording of its mother's voice on a pair of headphones. Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one."
"The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid, which is continuously swallowed by the fetus.

"Most people that lose their hearing lose it at what's called the cochlea, the inner ear. Music is just one of the strangest things that there is.

"Cochlear implant is a huge success story in modern medicine, says Dr Michael Schumacher. But most implant users struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad, he says. Music is a different capacity because it's abstract, and language is very precise."
"Music is the pinnacle of hearing, but it's hard to hear if you can't hear it properly. We would be better off if we had a better way to hear music. We want to hear it better, not just hear it, so we can hear it."
"Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument. The auditory cortex is the most active during speech. The sound quality, or the sound of the sound is how I like to describe timbre, tone color -- they cannot tell these things whatsoever."
"There's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls. The implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception. Patients cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips. We are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to."

"All spiders make silk at some point in their life. Spiders use silk for many purposes, including the trailing safety dragline and wrapping eggs for reproduction. Even fossil spiders can make silk, as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on a fossil spider."
"The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk, while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks. Inside each spider, there are hundreds of silk glands, sometimes thousands. They differ by size, shape, and sometimes even color."
"Spider silk is almost entirely protein. It's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web, and also the safety trailing dragline. There's also aciniform silk, which is used to wrap prey, and major ampullate silk, used in web construction."
" silk biologists try to relate sequences, these amino acid sequences, to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers. Dragline, or major ampullate silk, is the strongest of these fibers. The flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length."
"There are more than 40,000 species of spider. Some of them are orb-weaving, others are not. Spiders are able to make silk that is tough enough to catch and kill prey. The spider is able to do this by using a variety of different types of silk."
"The strength, extensibility and toughness of spider silks have attracted a lot of interest. Silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today. The next time you see a spider web, please, pause and look a little closer."
"You'll be seeing one of the most high-performance materials known to man. (Applause) So what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years.

"Focus ultrasound can be used to treat movement disorders, like Parkinson's or essential tremor. In the '50s, Lars Leksell tried to perform lobotomies in the brain, noninvasively, with focused ultrasound. The idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat brain lesions is not new, says InSightec CEO."
An experimental procedure is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. It uses focused ultrasound to ablate a point in the patient's thalamus. This is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the MR scan. It's a safety boundary around the target.
"The only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse. The only device he needs in this treatment is a transducer that measures temperature noninvasively. The first sonication is at lower energy. It doesn't do any damage, but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees."
"The temperature was raised to 43 degrees C temporarily. This doesn't cause any damage. But the point is we are right on target. So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen, then we move to perform a full-energy ablation."
"PJ: Pain is something that can make your life miserable. Pj: I would like to tell you about a 78 year-old man who suffered from pain in the buttock. PJ: He had metastases in his right buttock, and he couldn't sit even with medication. Pjj: He's back to his normal life."

"In 2004, the FDA approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. The challenge there with a breathing and awake patient -- and in all our treatments, the patient is awake and conscious -- is you have to teach the MR some tricks how to do it in real time."

"Ten years after he lost his sight, the world has moved on for him, he says. The biggest change for him was looking down at his hands and seeing that he'd lost 10 years of his life. ""We didn't have words like ""crowdsourcing"" and ""radical collaboration"" when I had my accident. But the concept held true"""
"""I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration,"" he says. ""The autobiographical self has prompted extended memory, reasoning, imagination, creativity and language"" ""I'm here to talk about the wonder and the mystery of conscious minds,"" he adds."
"Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made? Three reasons. First, curiosity. Second, understanding society and culture. Third, medicine. It would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains."
"What is consciousness? What is a conscious mind? We could take a very simple view and say, well, it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams, or when we go under anesthesia. But there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room. We are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images. We have selves."
"In order to have a conscious mind, you have a self within the conscious mind. A conscious mind is a mind with a self in it. We are only fully conscious when self comes to mind. We have a sense that it's everyone of us that is experiencing this -- not the person next to you."
"If I scan my retina through the horizontal plane, what I get is the following. On the right side, my retina is perfectly symmetrical. But on my left retina there is a bump, which is marked there by the red arrow. And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below. And that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image."
"The self is really the elusive problem. We generate brain maps of the body's interior and use them as the reference for all other maps. We have one body, not two, not three. There is just one reference point, which is the body."
"The body has many parts, and things grow at different rates, and they have different sizes and different people; however, not so with the interior. The things that have to do with what is known as our internal milieu are, in fact, extremely maintained day after day. If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range, you go into disease or death."
"If you damage the brain stem, you get complete paralysis, but your conscious mind is maintained. The brain stem provides the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body. The cerebral cortex provides the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images."
"The brain stem is the main source of consciousness in humans. It's the same in other species, but they have different types of brain stem. The brain stem and the brain stem are the source of our self-consciousness. The self is the part of the brain that is connected to the body."
"When a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration, he or she is blind. The prosthetic mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry and sends signals to the retina's output cells. A completely blind retina can now send out normal signals, signals that the brain can understand."
"The encoder is replacing the retinal circuitry with a set of equations. An image comes in, and out comes streams of electrical pulses, just like a normal retina would produce. The equations are serving as sort of a codebook for the retina."
"Researchers used a combination of an encoder and a transducer to reconstruct what a blind person's retina was seeing. With the standard method, patients can see high-contrast edges, they can see light, but it doesn't easily go further than that. With our approach, adding the code, it's much better. Not only can you tell that it's a baby's face, but you can also tell it is a baby."
"There are many people worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina, diseases like macular degeneration, and there's little that can be done for them. For the vast majority of patients, their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices. The problem is that current prosthetics don't work very well."
"A commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself. Tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device. ""To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power, are among the most painful exertions of the human will"""
"It's physically possible to exercise more. But resisting temptation is hard. It's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self. Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about using commitment devices to discipline himself. Sutter: ""When you try to execute these commitment devices, you realize the devil is really in the details"" ""I don't like the way that they take the power away from you,"" Sutter says."
"I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle. The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets. The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them. I've been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people's relationship to the future self."
"For every three baby boomers, the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they're in retirement. The first is called the distribution builder. It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes."
"The tool simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out. At the end, there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement. This is a simulation that uses graphics, but other people find motivating what money can buy, not just numbers."
"Researchers use software to age people and show them what they'll look like when they're 60, 70, 80 years old. Other conditions show people the future self. The future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income. If the present self saves a lot, the futureSelf is delighted."
"Virtual reality is not just good for making people look older. There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun. It's not telling you which way to put the slider, it's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self."

"The center provides the patients, the Afghan disabled, first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration. ""I was ready to tell him, ""Listen, if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow, please tell him that it was a mistake. Give him some money."" But Mahmoud and his son were already there."
"I was doing something that I was not supposed to do. Najmuddin was staying there, doing everything and reporting on the patients. He was telling me, ""Patients are coming."" For many years, we were just providing them with artificial limbs."
"Mahmoud's legs were improving week after week. The stump or cast prosthesis was made, and he was starting the real physical rehabilitation. He was coming every day, crossing the front line. It took quite many years for the program to become what it is now."

"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at what's happening in the world today. He says a shift in power has never happened in the way it's happening now. Defterio: ""We live at one of those times. It's part of the equation for our survival"""
"Power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation. It's also moving vertically. What's happening today is that the power that was encased within the institution of the nation state has now migrated onto the global stage. The lesson of history is that, sooner or later, where power goes governance must follow."
"U.N. needs to create a treaty-based institution to govern the world, says Peter Bergen. Bergen: ""The world needs an institution that can hold the powerful to account"" He says the U.S. should be the first to create such an institution, not the last."
"U.S. will remain the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi-polar world. But the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered. You're beginning to see the emergence of a multi-Polar world, says David Frum."
"The world now looks more like Europe in the 19th century, he says. A multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances. Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times when the West has tried to do it themselves, he adds."
"I suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when Western power was enough, he says. Increasingly, we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values, but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests."
"We are now interlocked, as nations, as individuals, in a way which has never been the case before. You get swine flu in Mexico, it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport 24 hours later.

"If you did this for all thousand TED Talks, you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000. The challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this, I would probably end up with a lot of summaries, but not with many friends in the end."
"If you summarized 1,000 TED Talks into 600 words, it would cost you hundreds of dollars. If you summarized 10 talks at the same time, you can cut costs by 90 percent. Some people on the Internet, some didn't do so well when asked to summarize 10 TED Talks."
"CNN's John Sutter started out with a thousand TED Talks and 600 six-word summaries. Sutter asked people to do summaries of those talks. For example, for the TED Talks about food, someone summed this up into: ""Food shaping body, brains and environment"" Sutter: ""Striving toward happiness = moving toward unhappiness"""
"CNN's John Sutter wanted to have a thousand TED Talks summarized into just six words. Sutter: The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000. ""Why the worry? I'd rather wonder,"" is a crowd-sourced summary."
"The first stage was completed at home, which consisted of marinating the chicken, amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab. The second stage was at the Penn State University main campus lab, which is where I extracted the chemicals."
"Marinating chicken in lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater inhibited carcinogen formation. Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation, but it was nearly negligible. soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens. The best way to marinate chicken, based on this, is to not under-cook and char the chicken."

"10 years after military intervention in Afghanistan, the country is far from secure. The situation, to be honest, is very serious. The military is necessary, but the military is no problem-solver. Afghans need a different political process than the one they were given in 2001, 2002."

"This is a picture of DNA in its classic double helix form. The two strands run in opposite directions, creating complications for living cells. This is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication occurring inside your body, at least in the early stages."
"DNA is about two nanometers across, which is really quite tiny. In each one of your cells, each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long. To keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code, it's wrapped around these purple proteins."
"This is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope. It's been filmed under time-lapse, which is why you can see it moving. These sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes. They go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots."
"The kinetochore is the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes. It is made up of about 200 different types of proteins, thousands of proteins in total. It broadcasts through chemical signals, telling the rest of the cell when it's ready, when it feels that everything is aligned."
Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process. The problem is we can't show it to you any other way. The idea is actually nothing new. Exploring at the frontier of science is mind-blowing. Discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science.

"In the secular world we think, ""If an idea is important, I'll bump into it. I'll just come across it."" Nonsense, says the religious world view. Religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time. This comes across in the way in which religions set up rituals."
"In the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career. But the religious world doesn't think that way. The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains, we are also bodies. And when they teach us a lesson, they do it via the body."
"Atheism 2.0 is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like, a new version of atheism we could call Atheism 1.0, he says. The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art are that art should be for art's sake and art should live in a hermetic bubble."
"Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith. It's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate. The word ""propaganda"" is a manner of being didactic in honor of something."
"Museums should make a room for love and generosity, he says. Art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society, he adds. The people in the modern world who are interested in matters of the spirit tend to be isolated individuals."
The Catholic Church is the most powerful institution in the world. The church has more power than any other religion. It has the power to change the course of history. It can also make a difference in the lives of the people it represents. It is a powerful force for good.
"Abrahamic religions are not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone, he says. They're for all of us, even if you don't believe any of it, he adds. If you're involved in anything that's communal, that involves lots of people getting together, there are things for you in religion."

"In the early 20th century, the only way to make a TV show was to make it better than the other shows on the air at the same time. In the 21st century, digital technology has made it easier for people to make shows that are better than others. This has led to the creation of the Internet."
"Congress passed the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. The media industry wanted it to outlaw copying full-stop. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed in 1998. It was a complicated piece of legislation, with a lot of moving parts. The law was intended to clarify the distinction between legal and illegal copying."
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed in 1998. The law made it illegal to sell digital content that was not copyable. It also made it legal to force people to use systems that broke the copying function of their devices. The main reason it hasn't worked is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular than expected.
"PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content. Because the biggest producers of content on the Internet are not Google and Yahoo, they're us, we're the people getting policed. The threat, in fact, is this inversion of the burden of proof."
"SOPA is a reversion of COICA, which was purposed last year, but did not pass. The content industries don't want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing. The DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act, which horrified those industries. The hard thing is this: get ready, because more is coming."
"SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act. PIPA is short for PROTECTIP, which is itself short for Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property. Time Warner has called and they want us all back on the couch, just consuming."

"Psychologist Paul Broks says we have a deep intuition that there is a core, an essence there. But neuroscience shows there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together, he says. This is because of the way that they relate that we get this sense of self, he adds."
"There is something about what it means to be you which defines you, and it's kind of permanent and unchanging. It's not that we don't exist, it's just that the trick is to make us feel that inside of us is something more unified than is really there."

"A new type of 3D printer has been developed that can build complex structures without the use of traditional methods. The new technology can be used to make everything from shoes to spinal implants. The technology was developed by a company based in the UK, but is now available worldwide."
"3D printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production. The technology was developed by a company called Within Technologies and 3T RPD. It's been used by product designers, or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and quickly create or reiterate a design."
3D printing is becoming more and more popular as a way to make implants. The technology is being used by aerospace and automotive companies. It's a lighter part and it uses less material waste than mass produced products. The price of the machines is also falling and they're becoming quicker.
"3D printing can be also used to download spare parts from the Web. You can use software like Google SketchUp to create products from scratch very easily. This technology is really going to disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and, I believe, cause a revolution in manufacturing."
"You can now download a product with software like this, view the product in 3D. You can direct what color that product will be, perhaps what material. And also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product, but within boundaries."
"Data is sent to a 3D printer, perhaps on someone's desktop. You can use it for functional customization, scanning parts of the body and creating things that are made to fit. We can run this through to something like prosthetics, which is highly specialized."
"Scientists are using MRI to create 3D models of the human body. The technology could lead to the creation of prosthetic limbs and organs. The process is still in its early stages, but it could be used to create prosthetics in the future."

"The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under microfinance. The biases, whether intentional or otherwise, are pervasive, and so are the misleading mental images. In the U.S., women-owned businesses will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018."
Small business owners are often left out of the economic recovery. The World Bank is trying to help by providing loans to small businesses. But the loans are often too small to cover the cost of running a business. The problem is that women often don't have the money to pay for their own businesses.

"My father had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country, his country, our country. He fired. Nothing happened. No German soldier fell to the ground. My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank."
Netherlands' Chief of Defence: Gun is an instrument of peace and stability. Violence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years. Murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages. occurrences of civil war and repression have declined since the end of Cold War.
"A state monopoly on violence, first of all, serves as a reassurance. The presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further. War is simply no longer the best option, and that is why violence has decreased."
"It is this participation in peacekeeping missions that has led to the resolution of many civil wars. The Dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law. Every day I hope that politicians, diplomats, development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope."
"""I stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world,"" she says. ""I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out and when they come home and need our care"" ""We cannot let them down. They put their lives on the line for us,"" she adds."
"The best way to visualize an electric field is to think of gravity. Gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses. We can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it's a mini space station. In cancer, cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth."
"Tumor Treating Fields use externally placed transducers attached to a field generator to create an artificial electric field. The field acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them. It prevents them from forming those chains, those mitotic spindles, that are necessary to pull genetic material into the daughter cells."
"Tumor Treating Fields have no effect on normal undividing cells, Dr. Palti says. The first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer, GBM. GBM affects about 10,000 people in the U.S. each year."
"In April of this year, the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM. It was the first time ever that the FDA included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim. Robert Dill-Bundi is a famous Swiss cycling champion."
"A year after treatment, Robert's tumor grew back with a vengeance. He was told by his doctors that he had about 3 months to live. He entered our trial. The therapy is delivered continuously at home, without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually."
"Tumor Treating Fields were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti, professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel. They use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer. Novocure's also working on lung cancer as the second target."
Tumor Treating Fields could be used to treat cancer patients in the next 10 years. The field could also be used with radiation to interrupt the body's self-repair mechanisms. New research is underway at the Karolinska in Sweden to prove that hypothesis.

"Harvard professor says 90 percent of long-term happiness is predicted by the way your brain processes the world. Only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ, 75% by optimism, social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of a threat."
"The absence of disease is not health. We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success. The problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons. If happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there."
"If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage. Your brain at positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed. Doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive."
Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it. Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters. meditation allows yourbrain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once.

"The World Bank estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country can expect up to 18 power outages per month. compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury, and can often be out of stock for months or even a year."
"The power went out during a routine surgery in Malawi. The nurse was able to anesthetize her patient quickly. The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in with a headlamp to finish his case. 35 million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia, says CNN's John Sutter."
The Universal Anesthesia Machine is a machine that would work and anesthetize his patients no matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer. The machine has a built-in oxygen concentrator that takes in room air and sends 95 percent pure oxygen up and across to the patient.
"The machine is designed to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in these rural districts. It comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier. You do not need to be a highly trained, specialized anesthesiologist to use it."
"Since 2010, we've done well over 2,000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events. This really seems like a cost-effective, scalable solution to a problem that's really pervasive. But we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the challenges of delivering anesthesia in low-income countries. Sutter: ""If we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world, rather than the one that we wished existed, we might just save a lot of lives"""

"The presenter is not the hero, the audience is the hero of our idea. A story can be told, but once a presentation is told, it completely flatlines. The presenter is the star of the show, but the audience are the heroes of the idea."
"A story has an arc -- well, an arc is a shape. A single idea, from the human mind, could start a groundswell, it could be a flash point for a movement. The role of the presenter is to be the mentor. You're not Luke Skywalker, you're Yoda."
"After years of study, Michael Wolraich drew a shape for a presentation. He then overlaid two different speeches over it, and it worked. ""I actually cried a little, because I was like, ""I've been given this gift,"" and here it is,"" he says."
"If you never pull that idea out for others to contend with, it will die with you. It's similar to sailing. When you're sailing against the wind and there is wind resistance, you have to move your boat back and forth. That's so you can capture the wind."
"Every presentation should have a call to action at the very end. You need to describe the world as a new bliss. This is the way the world is going to look, when we join together and we solve this big problem. So by planting in there the way they're going to resist between what is and what can be, is actually going to draw them towards your idea quicker than should you not do that."
"The audience is physically reacting to what the speaker is saying. He is modeling for the audience what he wants them to feel. He marvels at his own product more than the audience laughs or claps. Because if you communicate an idea in a way that resonates, change will happen, and you can change the world."

CNN's John Sutter talks about the role of place cells in the human brain. Place cells are the cells that tell the brain where to look. Sutter: Place cells help people remember where they are in the world. He says place cells can also be used to help people find their way out of trouble.
The hippocampus is the organ of memory in the human brain. It is particularly important for the ability to remember distances and directions of boundaries around you. The hippocampus fires when it detects boundaries or edges at particular distances. This is one way in which place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
"Grid cells are found, again, on the inputs to the hippocampus, and they're a bit like place cells. Each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid. The electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is."
The human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it. The neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other. So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery.
"Scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice. ""It's got to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon"" ""Nonlethal weapons will be great in these situations, but there's also a whole heap of problems"""
"CNN's John Defterios looks at some of the problems the Western military faces. He says military personnel often don't know if a person is hostile or not. They may end up shooting them, and then find out afterwards, yes, we shot the right person, or, no, this was just an innocent person."
"The heat ray is essentially a big microwave transmitter. It goes out to a really long distance, compared to any of these other sorts of things. Anybody who is hit with this feels a sudden burst of heat, and just wants to get out of the way."
CNN's John Defterios looked at the use of non-lethal weapons by Australian police. He found that they were using them in a very different way to the way they were used by the military. He also found that the police were using the weapons in a different way than the military was.
"Police in Queensland have used OC spray on 2,226 people in two years. OC spray was introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force. It was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent, who were potentially violent, and also quite frequently used toDeal with people simply passively noncompliant."
Nonlethal weapons are being routinely used to deal with a whole range of problems. One of the problems suggested with nonlethal weapons is that they might be used indiscriminately. The Dubrovka Theater siege in Moscow in 2002 was an example of a nonlethal weapon being used in this way.
"There were, in fact, only a couple of people who got shot in this episode. The final toll of hostages is a little unclear, but it's certainly a few more than that. The hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody; they were simply shot in the head."
"A police officer in Florida tasered a 6-year-old boy with a stun gun. A disabled woman in the U.S. was also tased by a police officer. ""Is this really an appropriate way to use nonlethal weapons?"" asks John Sutter."
"""We don't want to be all the same, but we want to respect each other and understand each other,"" he says. ""The more the world is flat, the more people are wanting to be different"" ""We believe in the security of having a local identity,"" he adds."

"Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone. At the Museum of the Rockies where we work, I have four T. rexes, so I can cut a whole bunch of them. The biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13."
"In the early 1900s, everyone wanted a bigger and better Tyrannosaur. By the 1970s, scientists were asking, ""Where are all the little dinosaurs?"" People assumed if they had little dinosaurs, they'd be easy to identify. But all they had were big dinosaurs."
"In 1975, Dr. Peter Dodson at the University of Pennsylvania realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do, which is different than the way reptiles grow. And it's kind of cool -- if you look at the cassowary, or any of the birds that have crests on their heads, they grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow."
"Researchers found that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like, if it grew in sort of a linear fashion, it would have a crest about half the size of the adult. But the actual subadult had no crest at all."
Dinosaurs are very hard to cut open. They're very spongy. So they don't normally let you do that. So I have to cut them open. And that's sort of what I've been doing. And we want to look at these three.
"Pachycephalosaurus has a big, thick dome on its head, and it's got some little bumps on the back of its head. And then Stygoloch, another dinosaur from the same time, has a little, tiny dome, and It's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose."
"Dracorex is the littlest one, Stygimoloch is the middle-size one, Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one. Scientists like to name things. The dome, that little dome, is growing really fast. It's inflating very fast."
"The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing, which means they're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger. Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on theback of its head were also resorbed."
"Triceratops' horns curve backwards as they grow up, then grow forward as they get older. The adult Triceratops was also spongy, but the adult Torosaurus had mature bone. Torosaurus is a dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a Tricer atops, except it's bigger and it's called Torosaurus."
"Triceratops and Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger than the other one. But one of my graduate students, John Scannella, looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops is open in Torosaurus."

"Atrazine is the number one contaminant of groundwater, drinking water, rain water. In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union, but in that same year, the United States EPA re-registered the compound."
"Atrazine is causing a hormone imbalance in the human body, he says. Exposure to atrazine turns on an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen. The enzyme is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole."
"Bisphenol A, BPA, was once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy. European Union passed a law banning the use of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups. Two weeks before that, the U.S. Senate refused to even debate banning BPA."
"80 percent of all amphibians are threatened and in come decline. Scientists believe that pesticides are an important part of that decline. The placenta cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals, he says."
"Tyrone's film shows how chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn child. DDT and DES and atrazine can also pass over into milk, again, affecting our babies even after their born. Many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we're seeing across industrialized nations."
"Tyrone: ""We collect these compounds our entire life and then we end up dumping it and dumping them into our unborn children"" ""We are in effect polluting our children,"" she says. ""It's not just women and children that are at risk"""
"Researchers have found that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine. Agricultural runoff from this crop is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village. Many of these workers have life expectancies of only 50."

"In the happiest marriages, the wife is thinner and better-looking than the husband. The more willing a husband is to do housework, the more attractive his wife will find him. Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives."
"Researchers found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce. The more attractive she finds him, the more sex they have. The nicer he is to her, the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed."
"Do not win an Oscar for best actress. It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided. It turns out, merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet. And when you have a close couple friend split, it increases your chances of getting a divorce."
"The US federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone's spouse. Beyond the profound federal perks, married people make more money. We produce happier, more stable and more successful kids. We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends, believe it or not."

"Sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them, says Michael O'Leary. The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language. In Kerry they were often known as ""ainmhide Na seolta,"" ""the monster with the sails"""
"Basking sharks are listed as vulnerable under the IUCN. They're the second-largest fish in the world. There's a ban on catching and even landing them, even landing ones caught accidentally. Some say it's not population decline, it might be a change in the distribution of plankton."
Basking sharks are harmless plankton-feeding animals. They are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour. They can feed on 30 kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive. Scientists use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark.
"The tags are attached to the shark and sent to a satellite. The satellite sends a signal to the tag, which is then sent to the ground. The tags can be used to track the shark's movements in the Irish Sea and the Atlantic Ocean."
"Basking sharks were important to coastal communities, going back hundreds of years, especially around the Claddaghduff, Connemara region. subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats, sometimes way offshore to a place called the Sunfish Bank to kill the basking sharks."
"Basking sharks have incredibly low diversity, according to a new study. The study found no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks. The whale shark's diversity is much greater, the study found. It's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck, thought to have been 12,000 years ago, that caused the low diversity."
"There are only 8,000 basking sharks left in the world. The population is so small that it is at risk of extinction. The only source of sharks in Ireland is dead sharks washed up on the coast. Some are caught in nets, in trawls, which are banned."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a new series on the Irish Sea. The series, which airs on CNN.com, will be called ""Shark Chronicles"" It will focus on the role of sharks in the environment and the environment in general."
"""I was desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks. So I wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle"" ""I then thought I'd invest 7.95 -- the price is still on it -- in my local hardware store in Kilrush"""
"Sharks have been around a long time, very important to coastal communities. The best-documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from Achill Island. Five individual sharks were sampled using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System."
"It is illegal to trade in basking sharks in Achill Island, Ireland. The males have claspers, which dangle out behind the back of the shark. If we can tell the gender of a shark before we sample it, we can. tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or female."
Traditional aid agencies had never before encountered. 80 percent of the people in Haiti had mobile devices in their hands. Tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers were scouring the Internet. They were converting tweets that had already been converted from texts into open-source maps.
Terra -- the Trilogy Emergency Response Application -- has been used to support the aid effort ever since the Haiti earthquake in 2010. Some 74 percent of people received the data. It's used to signal early warning in advance of weather-related disasters. It is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence.
"Citizens and communities are using technology to bring about change, positive change, in their own communities. The grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing. Young people living in Kibera in their community, with simple handheld devices, GPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones, have put themselves on the map."
"SMS information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns. In Mongolia, SMS is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation. By 2015, there will be three billion smartphones in the world. The U.N. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in 50 percent of the Developing World."
"Haiti needs to embrace big data, says UNICEF chief. ""We need technology as a core organizational principle,"" he says. ""It has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people in the humanitarian effort"" ""We now have the tools. There are no more reasons not to do it,"" he adds."
"CNN's John Defterios gives a look at the impact of climate change on North America. He says it could destroy the Great Bear Rainforest, the largest temperate rainforest in the world. It could also have huge impacts on the future of the agricultural heartland of North America, he says. Defterio: Join with the growing international community to get Canada to step up to its responsibilities."
The Alberta tar sands are the largest oil reserves on the planet outside of Saudi Arabia. They are home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world. The mining and the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before.
"The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of Canada's boreal forest. No tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval, so it is essentially a rubber stamp. Oil produced from either method produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil."
"The tailings ponds range in size up to 9,000 acres. That's two-thirds the size of the entire island of Manhattan. The Athabasca River drains downstream to a range of aboriginal communities. In Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there, are finding toxins in the food chain."
The boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem. The boreal is home to almost 50 percent of the 800 bird species found in North America. It is also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison in the world.
The Great Bear Rainforest is considered to be the largest coastal temperate rainforest in the world. It is threatened by the massive amount of water being drawn from the Athabasca River. The pipeline would take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea through the heart of the rainforest.
The world does not need any more fossil fuels. We need to ensure that our best and greatest defense against global warming is protected. And we can do that by working together to protect our environment and the lives of the people who live in it.
"The first time I saw the dark night sky, I was just flabbergasted at how many stars there were, and I felt tiny. Unlike stars, which are hot and glow invisible light so we can see them, our planet is, astronomically speaking,  pretty cold, so it doesn't really glow. You can't see the stars if you drown them out with light."
Technology is allowing us to access the sky in ways that are impossible otherwise. 60-70% of the energy we use to light the outdoors is wasted by blotting out the stars. The Hubble space telescope allows us to see things that we are incapable of seeing with our naked eye.
"Citizen science is when large research projects put their data online, teach ordinary people like you to go and interact with that data. One such example of this is what I'm showing here, called Galaxy Zoo. The idea behind this is an easy sell, but the actual process of planet hunting involves a lot of looking at graphs."
"Mile Živković: The experience of looking up and knowing that the sky that you're looking at surrounds every known living thing in the universe, is very profound. Our night sky is like a natural resource, as though it's a park that you can visit without ever having to travel there. The sky is inherently democratic. We are the only planet we know of that has life on it."
Darksky.org offers tips on how you can protect the dark night sky. Darksky says he never saw a truly dark sky until he was 15. He says the Cyrus cylinder is a great emblem of what Iran is at home and abroad.
"CNN's John Defterios looks at the parallels between the 539 BC battle of Babylon and the current Middle East crisis. Defterio: ""The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us"" He asks: ""What story of the world, do you want to see reflecting what is said in this cylinder?"""
"The story of the fall of Belshazzar and the birth of the Persian empire is told in a new novel. The novel, ""Cyrus,"" is based on the life of the Babylonian king, who declared himself king of the universe. The book is written by a team of highly skilled consultants."
"In the Book of Chronicles, the king of the four quarters of the world tells the story of the return of the Jews from Babylon. The Jews were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple. This is the central element, still, of the notion of return in Judaism."
"Cyrus was the first great world empire. He set up a model of how you run a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society. He left a dream of the Middle East as a unit, and a unit where people of different faiths could live together."
Cyrus was a central figure in Greek and European culture. He was the inspiration for the Founding Fathers of the U.S. The remains of his clay cylinder were discovered in Babylon in 1879. The discovery brought hope to those who believed in the scriptures.
CNN's John Sutter looks at the difference between the two accounts of the birth of God in the Bible. Sutter says the account of Marduk is more likely to be true than the one given by the Bible's writers. He says it's a remarkable example of two different ways of seeing the same thing.
The Cyrus cylinder was created in 1879 by the Shah of Iran. The cylinder is part of the Pahlavi dynasty's celebrations in Persepolis. The Shah invents an Iranian history that puts him in the center of a great tradition. It's an object with fascinating stories that are by no means over yet.
The Cyrus cylinder is a symbol of Iran's history and culture. The British Museum has loaned it to the National Museum of Tehran. The cylinder is seen by between one and two million people in the space of a few months. It's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means.
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the power of comedy in the face of adversity. Sutter: ""Comedy is a way of seeing the world in a new way"" Sutter's book, ""The Power of Comedy,"" is published by Simon & Schuster."
Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live of Sarah Palin were devastating. Limbaugh's description of John Edwards as the Breck girl was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career. The best comedy and satire comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity.
"The Daily Show is by far the most well-documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy. Survey after survey, from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy, has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows."
"The three things gay Americans seem to want most are to join the military, get married and start a family. The joke short circuits the emotional wiring behind the debate and it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter, to question its validity."
"Comedy has been crossing country with remarkable speed way before the Internet, social media, even cable TV. First there were drums and then knock-knock jokes. When you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline, it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation."

Richard Thaler: I want to address the issue of savings. I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow. We have on the screen a representative sample of 100 Americans. It's a program that Richard Thaler and I devised maybe 15 years ago.
One in 10 Americans say they don't save enough. That's a problem. We need to find a way to save more. Let's talk about it. We're going to have a chat about it on CNN.com/soulmatestories next week.
"We think about saving, but end up spending it, says the author of a new book. The author of the book argues that we should be saving for the future, not the present. The book is called The Power of Inertia, published by Biteback."
"When you get your driving license, you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ. In Austria, a neighboring country, slightly similar, slightly different. Not many people like checking boxes. It takes effort. You need to think."
"Inertia, lack of action. What is the default setting if people do nothing, if they keep procrastinating. In Germany, 12 percent check the box. In Austria, again, nobody checks the box, therefore, 99 percent of people are organ donors."
"We hate losing stuff, even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk. People frame savings as a loss because I have to cut my spending. It's a lot more fun to spend now. We talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box."
"Richard Thaler: ""We think we're going to save more next year"" Thaler and co-creator of ""Behavioral Finance 2.0"" ""Save More Tomorrow"" is an ""autopilot"" plan to help people save more in the future. Thaler says it's an easy way for people to save when they make more money."
"In 1998, Richard Thaler and I started a program to encourage workers to save more. Today, about 60 percent of the large companies have programs like this in place. The program is ""embarrassingly simple, but as we're going to see, extremely powerful"""
"Behavioral finance is extremely powerful. Overpopulation of relationships makes fights unavoidable. Property fights are the biggest trigger for all sibling fights. Over 95 percent of the fights among small children concern somebody touching, playing with, looking at the other person's stuff."
Children are born with a sense of right and wrong. They learn this through their siblings. They also learn to stand up for each other. This is how they learn to deal with conflict. It is also how they deal with the loss of their parents and siblings.
"Siblings are among the richest harvests of the time we have here. Our parents leave us too early, our spouse and our children come along too late. Our siblings are the only ones who are with us for the entire ride."
"When I was a boy, my brother and I would go to the park and play with our friends. We would often get into trouble because we were too young to know how to play with the other kids. One day, we decided to make a game out of it, but it turned out to be a nightmare for us."
"Siblings can claim none of that uniqueness. They're interchangeable, fungible, a kind of household commodity. The only limitation would be in sperm, egg and economics. Animals wrestle with these same issues, too. But they have a more straight-forward way of dealing with things."
"Piglets are born with a strange set of pointing teeth that they use to jab at one another as they compete for the nursing spots. Scientists call this ""De-identification"" The problem for scientists was that this whole idea of siblings as second class citizens never really seemed to hold up."
70 percent of fathers and 65 percent of mothers exhibit a preference for at least one child. Joe Kennedy was famous for this making it clear to his nine children that they were expected to compete with one another in athletics. Parents exacerbate this problem further when they exhibit favoritism which they do overwhelmingly.
"The most common favorite for a father is the last born daughter, the most common for a mother is the first born son. First borns across history have tended to be bigger and healthier than later borns, in part because of the head start they got on food in an area which it could be scarce. Second borns have a three point IQ advantage over second borns."
Last borns are often the ones who have to fight for their place in the family. They have to be able to charm their way to the top of the food chain. Last borns also tend to be the ones with the lowest self-esteem.
"Every person in your house has a discreet one-on-one relationship with every other person. In a five-person-family there are ten discreet dyads. The original Kennedy family with nine kids had 55 different relationships. The eight-person Brady Bunch, never mind the sweetness here, there were 28 dyads in that family."
"2,700 scientists from more than 80 countries around the world engaged in 540 ocean expeditions at a combined cost of 650 million dollars to study the distribution, diversity and abundance of life in the global ocean. The oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet. They, in fact, are an endangered species themselves."
"Human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last 50 to 100 years or so. The Romans developed salting, it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances. The oceans are hugely productive, as you can see by the satellite image of photosynthesis."
The oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe. The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we're responsible for it. The technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago.
"The ocean harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth, and much of it we don't know about. We can send out sound waves, they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back. Satellite tags can also track animals as they move through the oceans."
The Ocean Biogeographic Information System is the database for all the census data. It's open access; you can all go in and download data as you wish. It contains all the data from the census plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute.
CNN's John Defterios has compiled a list of all the species in the Gulf of Mexico. He says the list shows that there are still areas of the Gulf that are unexplored. The list also shows that the most diverse areas are in the middle of the ocean.
"The world's largest man-made lake, the Adirondacks, is the largest in the world. It is home to more than 1.5 billion people. It's also the largest reservoir of water in the entire world. The lake is also the biggest reservoir of carbon dioxide in the globe."
Scientists have discovered that some animals can survive without oxygen. They have also found a new species of yeti that lives in the South Pacific. This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface than all other habitats combined. It is not known why these animals live in such inhospitable conditions.
"We know about 16,500 marine species and there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go. We've got about 75 percent of the fish, maybe as much as 90 percent. We know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars than we do about this habitat."
"A single drop of seawater could contain 160 different types of microbes. The oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types. The most exciting thing about this census is the role of global science, says Dr. Michael Boulden."
"CNN's John Defterios has been documenting the effects of climate change on the world's oceans. He says the world needs to do more to protect the environment. Defterio: ""We need to make sure that we don't lose sight of the beauty of our oceans"""
"In the '70s, Europe did lots of development projects. Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000 fishers to impose on them industrial fishing. And I went sailing on it, and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea. What we caught, I know now, is the bottom of the sea."
"The bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down. Within a year, you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. The bottom is transformed from a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess. This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished."
Darwin was one of the world's greatest naturalists. He was killed by predators in his native Australia in the early 1800s. The species he hunted are now rarer than they were at the time of his death. He says people don't see his death as a loss because they don't lose abundant animals.
"With marine protected areas, we actually recreate the past. We recreate a past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low. There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago. A big fishery was run on it until the '80s."
"""Avatar"" evokes something that in a sense has been lost. The Galapagos still think it is pristine. The brochures still say it is untouched. So what happens here? The second story, also to illustrate another concept, is called shifting waistline."
"Economic growth is so essential to our society that it is rarely questioned. Growth has delivered many benefits, but it is based on a crazy idea. The crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet. With the Earth full, it's game over."
"The Earth is full of resources. We need to use them to develop technology and keep social stability. The only problem with this plan is that it's not possible. The idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly-efficient, solar-powered, knowledge-based economy transformed by science is a delusion."
"The planet is full of us, it's full of our stuff and full of waste, says David Cameron. The idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong, he says. ""It means we're not getting ready for what's really going to happen to us,"" he adds."
"CNN's John Defterios says the world is in a state of crisis. He says we need to get ready for the end of growth. Defterio: ""It is sad, but it is what it is. I've done my grieving about the loss"""
"Scientists say we need about 1.5 Earths to sustain this economy. The issue is, how will we react to climate change, he says. ""The future is inherently uncertain. But let's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen"""
"We are in danger, all of us, and we've evolved to respond to danger with fear. We need to feel our response now while the lights are still on. Yes, things will get ugly, and it will happen soon. But we are more than capable of getting through everything that's coming."
"Scientists tell us we may need to eliminate net CO2 emissions from the economy in just a few decades. ""The One Degree War Plan"" is so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required. In financial terms, this would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn, going further into debt every year."
"We have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago. We've built a powerful foundation of science, knowledge and technology. But of course, you can't borrow natural resources, so we're burning through our capital, or stealing from the future."
"The robot has four rotors. If you spin these rotors at the same speed, the robot hovers. When you increase the speed of each of the rotors, then the robot flies up. And when that happens, there's a moment that causes this robot to roll. That's basically how this thing operates."
"The robots can perform 360-degree flips in less than half a second. They are controlled by sensors and gyros on board. The robots have many applications, including first responders and construction workers. The smaller the robot, the more quickly it can turn."
"Robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings, to assess the damage after natural disasters, or sent into reactor buildings to map radiation levels. The robots can be used for transporting cargo. They live in a 12-dimensional space, and transform it into a flat, four- dimensional space."
"The robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles. They are capable of executing any curve trajectory. These are circular trajectories, where the robot pulls about two G's. They weigh thousands of pounds, are not by any means agile. But the vehicles you see here are big enough to go through hoops."
"The robots are designed to be able to fly in formation with other robots. They are not designed to fly themselves, but to coordinate with each other. The robots are made up of a number of different robots that work together to form a formation."
"The robots monitor their neighbors' positions and calculate control commands 100 times a second, which then translates into motor commands. The robots have to base their actions only on local information -- what they sense from their neighbors. So this is what we call anonymity."
"Researchers have developed robots that can build cubic structures from truss-like elements. The robots can also be used to pick up objects cooperatively. The technology could be used in the real world, where there is no GPS to guide the robots."
"Professor Nathan Michael: ""Robots like this can really change the way we do K-12 education"" Professor Frank Shen: ""The coordinate system is defined based on the robot, where it is and what it's looking at"" ""Without GPS, these robots can fly indoors,"" Professor Michael says."
"This video was created by two students, Alex and Daniel. The robots that play in the video are completely autonomous. You will see nine robots play six different instruments. This video was made exclusively for TED 2012. It is the first of a series of videos about the conference."
"Ilyse Hogue: ""I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again"" Ilyse: ""We could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often"" ""I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly"""
"A third to a half of the population are introverts, according to the U.S. Census. ""When it comes to creativity and to leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best,"" says Dr. Aaron Carroll. ""It is also our colleagues' loss and our communities' loss,"" he says."
"Introversion is different from being shy. Shyness is about fear of social judgment. Introversion is more about, how do you respond to stimulation, including social stimulation. Extroverts crave large amounts of stimulation, whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on when they're in quieter, more low-key environments."
"The author says she loves extroverts, including her husband. She says introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions. introverts tend to be more careful, less likely to take outsize risks, she says. The author: ""Some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts"""
"Some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum. Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, dreamed up many of his creations in a lonely bell tower office. Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle in Hewlett-Packard."
"In a group of people, you can't even be in a group without instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions. Western societies, and in particular the U.S., have always favored the man of action over the ""man"" of contemplation. So why are we setting up our schools this way, and our workplaces?"
"In the 20th century, we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality. The self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" The more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves, the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions."
"My grandfather was a rabbi and lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn. His favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read. When he died at the age of 94, the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd."
"""I just published a book about introversion, and it took me about seven years to write,"" he says. ""I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get"" ""We truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change,"" he adds."
"Nemo Marlin was born premature and had to have blood transfusions. Marlin: ""I don't know if my parents really believe that, but I didn't want to prove them wrong"" ""I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given"""
"""Use what you know. Draw from it"" is the first story lesson of the TED Talk. ""We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning"" ""There isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story"" ""Make me care"""
"""The Princess of Mars"" was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. In the book, the narrator is summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion. He finds out his uncle has mysteriously passed away and been entombed in a mausoleum."
"A well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end. It's the purest form of cinematic storytelling. The audience actually wants to work for their meal, says MacGregor."
"""Finding Nemo"" co-creator: ""We can't stop ourselves from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in"" ""The elements you provide and the order you place them in is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience,"" he says."
"The author believes that you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way, and there's no changing it. Some of us are born with temperaments that are positive, some are negative. A major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it."
"Pixar co-founder John Lasseter: ""Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty"" ""If things go static, stories die, because life is never static,"" he says. ""We really wanted to prove that you could tell stories completely different in animation,"" he adds. ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Lion King"" were considered ""successful"""
"Disney's ""Toy Story"" is one of the most popular children's books of all time. The film is based on the popular 1980s children's book of the same name. The story is about a young boy and his adventures in a happy village."
"""Sleeping Beauty"" is a new series on CNN.com. The series follows the lives of a family of children. The show is based on the popular children's book of the same name. It is the first of a two-part series to air on CNN in October."
"The writer says he could tell there was a grand design under every shot, every scene, every line of Lawrence of Arabia. He says the movie was an attempt for Lawrence to figure out where his place was in the world. The writer says wonder is honest, it's completely innocent and can't be artificially evoked."
"In 1981, scientists published an article concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees Celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2. If we had started in 2005, it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance."
"In the 1980s, I warned that global warming would lead to more extreme weather. I decided to stop talking about it because I didn't want my grandchildren to know. By the time I spoke again in 2005, the evidence was clear, he says."
"CNN's John Defterios writes about the impact of climate change on the world. He says the world is in a state of imbalance, with more energy coming in than going out. The U.S. government is trying to correct the imbalance, he says, but it's difficult."
Climate change deniers argue that the Sun is the main cause of climate change. But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record. This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses.
"Climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying, ""Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change, not vice versa"" But that lag is exactly what is expected. Small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth."
"The last time CO2 was 390 ppm, sea level was higher by at least 15 meters, 50 feet. Most estimates are that, this century, we will get at least one meter. Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries. The economic consequences are almost unthinkable."
"The Midwest and Great Plains are expected to become prone to extreme droughts. ""It would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control,"" he says. ""This path, if continued, guarantees that we will pass tipping points"""
"Morton Bast: Great careers are really and truly, for most people, just a matter of luck. Bast: We're going to go through a whole long list -- your creativity in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do if you want to have a great career."
"CNN's John Sutter: People who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive. He says it's a fine line between madness and genius. Sutter says those who are trying to find their passion should work hard to succeed. ""You know what? Here's a little secret: You want to work?"" he says."
I only want to talk to those of you who want a great career. You found something you're interested in. It's not the same thing as passion. I'm interested in this. And what about the rest of humanity's activities? I'm not interested in them.
"You need 20 interests, and then one of them might grab you more than anything else. You must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny, or are you afraid of the word ""destiny""? Do you fear the word 'destiny' because you're afraid of what you want to do?"
"""There are great jobs and great careers, and then there are the high-workload, high-stress, bloodsucking, soul-destroying kinds of jobs"" ""I want to be a great parent, and I will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment"" ""You're a hero no matter what. Look at the worldview you've given yourself"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks to parents about how to talk to their children. ""I don't hate children. I don't kick them,"" Sutter says. ""But what do you mean? That's what you expect me to say?"" Sutter asks."
"""I had a dream once, too, but -- But -- So how are you going to finish the sentence with your ""but""? ""You know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships. It is because you are -- you know what you are,"" he says."
"You're not going to have a great career because you're afraid to try. The ""unless"" word is also attached to that other, most terrifying phrase, ""If only I had ..."" If you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain, it will hurt a lot."
"Underneath each one of those is a cell, and this cell's a neuron that is going to send information about wind or vibration. We need to take off the leg of a cockroach -- don't worry, they'll grow back -- then we're going to put two pins in there. One will pick up this electronic message, this electric message is going by."
"The brain is sending all this information back about what you're seeing, hearing. You have 100 billion cells making these raindrop-type noises. This is called rate coding: the harder you press on something, the more spikes there are."
"The experiment involved plugging two pins into a cockroach and an iPod into its ear. The brain is sending out electrical impulses in the same way as the earbuds. The biggest speakers have the longest waves, and the current is what's causing them to move."
"Greg Gabe: To understand how the brain works, you have to go inside a living brain. Gabe: We're going to use our good friend the cockroach because they have brains very similar to ours. He says if you learn a little bit about how their brains work, we'll learn a lot about how our brains work."
"Physicists believe there are about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. If each star was the size of a single grain of sand, it would fill a 30-foot stretch of beach three feet deep. The entire Earth doesn't have enough stars to represent the overall universe."
"Recent theories in physics are telling us there could be countless other universes built on different types of particles, with different properties. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond. But nonetheless, combined, they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes in up to 11 dimensions."
"There must be countless other planets teeming with life in the universe. If any one in 10,000 has conditions that might support a form of life, that's still 50 million possible life-harboring planets right here in the Milky Way."
"An intelligent alien civilization could easily have spread out across the galaxy, perhaps creating giant energy-harvesting artifacts or fleets of colonizing spaceships. And yet we see no convincing evidence of any of it. Maybe a single, superintelligent civilization has indeed taken over the galaxy."
Maybe we're not looking at the right place. Maybe we're looking at a new form of life. Or maybe we're just looking for a new way to communicate with the rest of the solar system. We'll have to wait and see.
"Amazing experiments are being done to try to create life from scratch, life that might be very different from the DNA forms we know. All of this will help us understand whether the universe is teeming with life or whether, indeed, it's just us. The fact that we think and dream and ask these questions might yet turn out to be one of the most important facts about the universe."
"In the deepest, darkest places on Earth, we find life, which tells us that life really wants to happen. All over the world -- in the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, the rocks actually turn to liquid. The thing that's special about this water is that it's at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico."
"The mid-ocean ridge is 50,000 miles long, and we've hardly had a peek at it. The largest waterfall on the planet is actually under the ocean, up near Iceland. To explore it, you've got to have technology and a team of people."
"Divers go into the water and once you hit the water, it's amazing. You don't hear the surface ship anymore, you hear that pinging of a sonar. We thought that nothing could live inside that world at the bottom of the ocean. When we look, we find some amazing things."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to the deepest part of the ocean to find new species of life. He says the discovery ""revolutionizes the way we think about life on Earth"" Defterio: ""You don't always have to have sunlight to get life going"" on Earth."
"Vampire squid has glowing pods on his butt that look like eyes. Microbes are actually eating the hull of the Titanic. The Titanic is an interesting place for biology, because animals are moving in to live on it. The ship was supposed to show up in New York this April."
"Seven billion people live on this planet and all of us are impacted by the sea. The oceans control the air you breathe, the water you drink, the food you eat. The average depth of the ocean is 15 of those on top of one another."
"Christopher Columbus discovered that the world is spherical. Most volcanoes on Earth are at the bottom of the sea -- more than 80 percent. And we actually have fire, fire deep inside the ocean, going on right now. But what you probably don't know is in the very deep part of the ocean,. we have volcanic eruptions."
Eratosthenes invented the word geography. Armand Fizeau was an experimental physicist in Paris. We're discovering particles that may travel faster than the speed of light. All of these discoveries are made possible by technology that's been developed in the last few decades.
"When Galileo was trying to send a beam of light, he used a piece of equipment called a clicker. The clicker was used to measure the speed of light in a certain area. The trick was to make the light beam bounce off the clicker into a different area."
"""We are all bags of meat and water. We all start with the same tools,"" he says. ""The people that made these discoveries just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,"" he adds. ""Their curiosity changed the way people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world"""
Eratosthenes was the third librarian at the great Library of Alexandria. He credits that conversation with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry you out to the edge of human knowledge. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball going to the back of the wagon.
CNN's Jim Boulden talks to a group of students at the University of Virginia. He says the students are looking for a way to make a difference in the world. The students say they want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.
"The world's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase. Some shut down the self using meditation, others use psychedelic drugs. Others use dancing, spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence. But here's the weirdest place of all: war."
"Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives. The self seems to thin out, or melt away, and it feels good, it feels really good, in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives."
"The capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human. The function of religion was to unite people into a group, into a moral community. When we climb that staircase, self-interest fades away, and we feel as though we are better, nobler."
"My Talk today is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons, why most people consider themselves to be spiritual. Is it a product of natural selection, like our hands? Charles Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves, but they're of great use to our groups."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the role of cooperators in society. Sutter: Co-operators can only win if they all pull together as a team. ""When that happens, the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down,"" he says."
"In a simulation, a group of green and blue golf balls interact. As they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow, and when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split. That's how they reproduce and the population grows. But suppose then that one of them mutates. There's a mutation in the gene and one of it mutates to follow a selfish strategy."
"Darwin's laws don't change, but now there's a new kind of player on the field. Once several wasps were all together in the same hive, they had no choice but to cooperate. These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world."
"Human groups may look like hives for brief moments, but they tend to then break apart. In fact, often, as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts, often those divisions are along religious lines. When people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement, they can move mountains."
"Human beings evolved to see sacredness all around us and to circle around sacred objects, people and ideas. Politics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest, but politics is also about sacredness. Music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since Napster came on the scene."
"Piracy costs the U.S. economy 50 billion dollars a year. The movie industry loses 370,000 jobs to content theft, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they made copyright law."
"When the law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. An iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs, which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media. The Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft."

"If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy. empathy's the antidote to shame. If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially. The two most powerful words when we're in struggle: me too."

"""I'm going to be really honest with you. When I became a ""vulnerability researcher"" and that became the focus because of the TED talk, and I'm not kidding. I sat down, and she said, ""God, you look like hell"" ""It was a fricking spiritual awakening"""
"""I'm going to walk you in to shame,"" he says. ""It's the best way to shut people down. It's the only way to get people to listen to you"" ""I'm not afraid to be vulnerable,"" he adds. ""I don't want to be ashamed of being vulnerable"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks to TED Fellows about the need to talk about race. Sutter: ""We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery"" ""You can't fix that problem without addressing shame,"" Sutter says. ""All-powerful folks don't need checklists"""
"The TED conference is like the failure conference, he says. ""Very few people here are afraid to fail. And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed"" ""I've failed miserably, many times. I don't think the world understands that, because of shame. Shame is that thing,"" he adds."
"Shame drives two big tapes -- ""never good enough"" and ""who do you think you are?"" There's a huge difference between shame and guilt. Shame is highly, highly correlated with addiction, depression, violence, aggression, bullying, suicide, eating disorders."
"Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender. For women, shame is, do it all and never let them see you sweat. For men, it's a web of conflicting expectations about who we're supposed to be."
"The largest aquifer in North America is from Midland, Texas to the South Dakota border, across eight states. There had to have been 800,000 wells fracked in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas in that aquifer. ""I don't understand why the media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania"""
"CNN's John Defterios says natural gas is the cleanest of all. He says he's trying to get energy solved for America. Defterio: If someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution, are you ready to invest in it?"
"The cost of all this to the world is 89 million barrels of oil, give or take a few barrels, every day. And the cost annually is three trillion dollars. And one trillion of that goes to OPEC. That has got to be stopped."
"There are 12 aircraft carriers in the world. One is under construction by the Chinese and the other 11 belong to us. Most of the 11 we have are tied up in the Mid-East. They're there to control, keep shipping lanes open and make oil available."
"The U.S. is using 20 million barrels of oil a day, producing eight and importing 12. 70 percent of that is used for transportation fuel, he says. ""We don't even realize the resources that we have available to us,"" he adds."
"The days of cheap oil are over, says President Obama. We're headed to natural gas, he says. It's 25 percent cleaner than oil. It does not require a refinery. It comes out of the ground at 130 octane. You're probably thinking that was my birth year."
"We have 4,000 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that's available to us. It's going to be very simple for us to use. It will replace or be able to be used for that. It was 1928. It would be three times what the Saudis claim they have."
"CNN's John Defterios says natural gas could be the ""bridge fuel"" for the U.S. He says the country has plenty of methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent. Defterio: ""I've been a realist -- I went from theorist early to realist. I'm back to theorist again"""

"TBP: ""I'm not ready to give up, but Jim and I talked there as he left"" CA: ""Well it's a bridge fuel, is what it is"" TBP: If that's it and that becomes the reason that renewables don't get invested in, then, long-term, we're screwed anyway."
"TBP: I think where we're headed, the long-term, I don't mind going back to nuclear. Do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon? TBP: Does that make sense? Do you like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program? T BP: I can tell you it will be a failure."
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks about the impact of fracking on women's health. ""We're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign,"" he says. ""It's a big wake-up call"" for women, he says, ""and it's not going to happen overnight"""
One in two women will die of heart disease. We need to do more to prevent this. We have to do better. We must do more. We can do this. It's not too late. We've got to do it. We're here.
"Women are dying of heart disease, two, three, four times more than men. Women are not recognized for their heart disease. They don't get treated, they don't getting detected, and they don'st get the benefit of modern medicines."
"CNN's Kelly Wallace sits down with the director of the Women's Health Initiative. She says the initiative has helped raise awareness of women's health issues. ""It's informed us about osteoporosis, breast cancer, colon cancer,"" Wallace says. ""Women are worth it"""
"Women have more heart attacks than men, according to a new study. Women's arteries erode, while men's arteries fill with blood. Women are often sent home from the hospital with the symptoms of a heart attack. The study shows that not enough is being done to treat the problem."
"When we watch people become obese, where do men get fat? Right here, it's just a focal -- right there. And we said, ""We're going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is probably different, and deposited differently, than men"""
"Since 1984, more women die in the U.S. than men. The syndrome, the female-pattern now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction. MRI is the only modality that can see the inner lining of the heart. The second reason we really liked MRI is that there's no radiation."
"The Yentl syndrome is explaining a lot of these gaps, says Dr. M.R. Hernández. ""Women bring new life into the world,"" he says. ""They are our life-saving treatments"" Women's stem cells are better at identifying injury, doing cellular repair or even producing new organs, Hernán says."
"Researchers have shown that female stem cells, when put even into a male body, do better than male stem cells. Women do, on average, have better longevity than men. We still have two to three more women dying for every man. Women should theoretically do better if we could just get treated."
We've been working on male-pattern heart disease for 50 years. We're 35 years behind. But we cannot stop now. Too many lives are at stake. This is what we need to do with heart disease now. And it's political.
"I implore you to join the Red Dress Campaign in this fundraising. Breast cancer, as we said, kills women, but heart disease kills a whole bunch more. So if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge, we have a lot of lives to save."

"CNN's John Sutter talks to the Poet Laureate about his love of poetry. Sutter: ""I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places -- poetry on buses, poetry on subways, on billboards, on cereal boxes"" ""Budapest"" is a little poem that reveals the secrets of the creative process, Sutter says."
"BC: Poetry just says a few things in different ways. BC: One of my students came up after class, an introductory class, and she said, ""You know, poetry is harder than writing"" BC: So I like to at least pretend it just flows out."
"The poem begins with a certain species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia. The name of the author is the first to go, followed obediently by the title, the plot, the heartbreaking conclusion. It is as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain."
"""The Country"" is based on a poem written by J.K. Rowling. The poem was written in response to a series of incidents involving a man and a woman. The woman was killed in a car accident. The man was injured in a house fire. The story is about the man's struggle to overcome his fear of death."
"""The Dead"" was written after a friend's funeral. ""The dead are always looking down on us,"" the poem says. ""It took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together,"" the poet says of his marriage."
"Cleveland.com's John Sutter reads a poem by Franz Schubert. The poem is called ""To My Favorite 17-Year-old High School Girl"" Sutter: ""Who cares if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15 or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17?"""

"All of us are, in fact, going to die in the 21st century. Sudden death has become very rare. The dying process of those with terminal illness occurs to younger people. Only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer."
"At least six out of 10 of the people in this room will die in this form. Increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now. The last few years of your life is spent with a great deal of disability. We are all, most of us, living to reach this point."
"In the next 10 minutes, a hundred million of my cells will die. I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up. Why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this?"

"""We can't just conserve our way out of this problem,"" he says. ""We have to find a way to solve this problem"" ""We're going to do it the old-fashioned way. We're not going to give up. We are not giving up."""
"The battery was invented about 200 years ago by a professor, Alessandro Volta, at the University of Padua in Italy. His invention gave birth to a new field of science, electrochemistry, and new technologies such as electroplating. The way things stand today, electricity demand must be in constant balance with electricity supply."
"The Hall-Heroult cell operates at high temperature, a temperature high enough that the aluminum metal product is liquid. The electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water, but rather salt that's melted. It's this combination of liquid metal, molten salt and high temperature that allows us to send high current through it."
"The battery is made of liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte. Today, we can produce virgin metal from ore at a cost of less than 50 cents a pound. ""I became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale"""
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on this project for more than a year. He says the project could be used to create a new form of energy. Defterio: ""It could be a way to make energy from renewable resources more abundant"""
"The battery is the key enabling device here. We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell. We've operated over 400 of these, perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries. With it, we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun doesn't shine."
"The battery has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt-hours -- two million watt-hours. That's enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of 200 American households. The battery is silent, emissions-free, no moving parts, remotely controlled."
A new form of energy storage is being developed. The technology is called a liquid metal battery. It is designed to reduce the cost of energy production. It can also be used to store energy in the event of a power outage. It has the potential to revolutionize the way energy is produced.

"In 1903, Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina. In 1947, there was no wind tunnel data beyond Mach 0.85. Chuck Yeager became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound."
"DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built. At Mach 20, we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds. At that speed, the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel."
"We've flown twice. In the first flight, no aerodynamic control of the vehicle. But we collected more hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of ground-based testing combined. And in the second flight, three minutes of fully-controlled, aerodynamic flight at Mach 20."
The first hummingbird prototype flew for 20 seconds in 2008. A gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe. A robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human could one day be a Gecko Man.
"Researchers have created structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot. A four-by-four-inch artificial nano-gecko adhesive can support a static load of 660 pounds. Experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS. Each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months. Last September, the gamers of Foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys. For 15 years, it was unsolved in the scientific community."
"In 1969, the internet was but a dream, a few sketches on a piece of paper. And then on October 29th, the first packet-switched message was sent from UCLA to SRI. The first two letters of the word ""Login,"" that's all that made it through."
"Leymah was asked to live with a village chief in Liberia. The chief had a little girl who walked around only in her underwear. The girl's mother died while giving birth to her, and no one had any idea who her father was."
"In Liberia, for example, the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls. The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child. There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls. All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally, I think, has failed."
The Young Girls Transformative Project helps girls in rural Liberia. The project has helped over 300 young women in the country. One of the women is a teen mother of four who can't afford to go to college. The group's goal is to help young women become leaders in their communities.
"Leymah: ""My wish is to be educated. And if I can't be educated, when I see some of my sisters being educated, my wish has been fulfilled"" ""I wish for a better life. I wish for food for my children,"" she says. ""And I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop"""

"Leymah: ""Even pretty girls vote"" in rural Liberia. She says girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration. ""They were able to mobilize young women,"" she says. ""And they went to those who were running for seats to ask them what they would give the girls"""
"Jean Robert-Houdin first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller. The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction. There are tales of creation and loss, death and resurrection, and obstacles that must be overcome."
"Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination. But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected, we laugh. The finale defies logic, gives new insight into the problem, and audiences express their amazement with laughter."
"Marco Tempest: We all want to share our stories, whether it is the trick we saw at the party, the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation. Today, thanks to technology, we can share those stories as never before, by email, Facebook, blogs, tweets."
"A teaspoon of seawater can contain more than a million living creatures. Trillions are born here, but only a few make it to adulthood. The real powers of this place come from phytoplankton. Single-celled life transforms sunlight and carbon dioxide into edible gold."
"The food web is so tangled and complex, even scientists don't know who eats whom. During the day, I'd return to the darkness, where I'd join my bizarre companions. Some of these snare their prey with sticky tentacles, while others just take a bite out of their cousins."

Technology is making a bid to redefine how we care for each other. We have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability. We're drawn to computer games that seem like worlds. We spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub.
"CNN's John Sutter has written a new book about the power of digital technology. Sutter: ""We're letting it take us places that we don't want to go"" ""Our little devices, those little devices in our pockets, are so psychologically powerful,"" Sutter says."
We remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones. People want to customize their lives. They want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention.
"Writer says people can't get enough of each other, if and only if they can have each other at a distance, in amounts they can control. She calls it the Goldilocks effect: not too close, not too far, just right. What might feel just right for that middle-aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about how technology is replacing real conversation. Sutter: ""People get so used to being short-changed out of real conversation, that they've become almost willing to dispense with people altogether"" He says we use conversations with each other to learn how to have conversations with ourselves."
"Technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable. We expect more from technology and less from each other. ""I felt myself at the cold, hard center of a perfect storm,"" says David Weinberger. ""That robot can't empathize. It doesn't face death. it doesn't know life."""
"From social networks to sociable robots, we're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. We turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control. But we're not so comfortable. We are not so much in control."
"Psychologist says we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings. But in the process, we set ourselves up to be isolated. Solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments."
"If we don't teach our children to be alone, they're only going to know how to be lonely. We grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up. But it's not, it's early days. There's plenty of time to reconsider how we use it."

"The book debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Seller list. The author says the book invites exploration, consideration and touch. ""It all sort of started as a benign mistake, like penicillin,"" he says. ""I am all for the iPad, but trust me -- smelling it will get you nowhere"""
"The book has spent 14 weeks on the Best Seller list, eight printings, and still going strong. We're talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling, and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl."
"If these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you, that means we did the right job. This shows a lot of internal structures. For students, it's quite an experience, but for a school, it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain."
"Anatomage Table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray. Students can isolate anybody and dissect any way they want to. The majority of anatomic classes taught, they do not have a cadaver dissection lab."
"Anatomage Table lets students experience dissection without a human cadaver. Table is touch-interactive, just like the way they do dissections in the lab. Digital body is one-to-one life size, so this is the way students will see the real anatomy."
"About 40 percent of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture. That's 60 times larger than all the areas we complain about, our suburban sprawl. Half of humanity lives in cities today, but a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food."
"This is what our planet looks like from outer space at nighttime, if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet. We're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture, but also we're using a lot of water. We've literally consumed an entire river in North America for irrigation. This is not even the worst example in the world."
"In the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water to irrigate the desert to grow cotton to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union. One of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of Soviet biological weapons testing. Today, you can walk there today."
"Gore: ""We are dominating much of our planet, and mostly through the use of energy that we see here at night"" ""We already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water that's sustainable,"" he says. ""We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture"""
Agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age. It rivals climate change in importance. We have to provide food and feed and fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people in the world today.
"The U.S. is trying to double global ag production around the world. The problem is the remaining lands are in sensitive areas. We could grow more food by expanding farmland, but we'd better not. Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint of agriculture and farm the lands better."
"""We can grow food in the background, but we don't have a lot of clean water"" ""I'm fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology"" ""If we come back to the same place in 2001, what we're going to find is that these roads spurt off"""

The chimps were able to pull the box together even though one of the chimps was not interested in the food. Scientists believe this is because chimps return favors."
"Researchers in Thailand use elephants to test how well they understand cooperation. ""It's very dangerous to work with elephants. ... You cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant,"" says researcher. ""You can probably make it, but it's going to be a pretty clumsy apparatus,"" he says."
"The elephants are trained to cooperate with each other and share their feelings. They are also taught empathy, which is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. The research was conducted on elephants in the wild. The elephants were taught new techniques that were not approved of by the researchers."
Yawn contagion is something that we share with other animals. Humans yawn when others yawn. It activates the same areas in the brain. People who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic. We study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head that yawns.
"The study is on altruism and chimpanzees, where the question is: Do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else? And for decades it had been assumed that only humans can do that. The way to study empathy in human children is to instruct a family member to act distressed, and then to see what young children do."
"Vicki Horner: Chimps are very power-hungry and wrote a book about it. The one who makes the choices -- that's the interesting part here -- for the ones who make the choices, it doesn't really matter, she says."
"Researchers found that chimpanzees do care about the well-being of somebody else. The research has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees. ""I painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom and humanity included, was that deep down we are competitors, we are aggressive, we're all out for our own profit"""
"The monkeys are given a rock, a piece of cucumber and a grape. The first monkey to eat the rock wins. The second monkey gets the grape. It's a game of ""who gets the best of the two?"" The winner gets the rock."
"The study became very famous and we got a lot of comments, especially anthropologists, economists, philosophers. They didn't like this at all. Because they had decided in their minds, I believe, that fairness is a very complex issue, and that animals cannot have it. So we're getting very close to the human sense of fairness."
"The project aim is to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up, so to speak, without necessarily god and religion involved, and to see how we can get to an evolved morality. I think morality is much more than what I've been talking about, but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates."
"This is a model of the patient's aorta, created using MRI and CT imaging. The patient has Marfan syndrome and is a process engineer by trade. The model was made using rapid prototyping technique and a bespoke porous textile mesh."
"The new treatment for heart failure takes just four and a half hours to install. The patient's heart is still beating at the same time as the new device is inserted. The new treatment is available in the U.S. and Europe, but not in Australia."
"How does a process engineer end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life? Well, the answer to that is, a multidisciplinary team. This is a list of the core team, and you can see there aren't only two principal technical disciplines there, medicine and engineering. There are various specialists from within those two disciplines."
"The first CAD model we made was a mirror image of the real aorta. In the real world, we always look down on plans, plans of houses, or streets, or maps. The Brompton Hospital was taken over by the Imperial College School of Medicine. There are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations."
"Professional jealousies were a problem for Pepper. The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome. Funding barriers were another big area to be concerned with. Pepper: 'I went after private investors, just gave up on it. It was a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives'"
"""We all understand CAD and RP. Not in the medical world. They don't want to change. They simply want to do whatever they've done before"" ""We've actually got 30 patients. At seven and a half years, we've got 90 post-op patient years between us. And still, there are people in the UK saying, ""That external aortic root, it will never work"""
"The benefits of working in a multidisciplinary team are 'stonkingly huge', says Professor Tom Treasure, professor of cardiothoracic surgery. 'You can find really novel solutions that have never been looked at before, very quickly and easily,' he says."
"""I'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted,"" he says. ""There are absolutely standard surgical treatments, probably in the USA, which cost more for a one-off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream"""
"The singer-songwriter was born in China and moved to the U.S. at the age of five. She is now based in Nashville and has performed all over the world. ""I see the power of music to connect cultures,"" she says."
"""I see, even more importantly, the power of music to connect hearts and minds,"" he says. ""And in that moment, we weren't our American selves, we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here"""
"The banjo was the inspiration for ""Shady Grove,"" a song by Doc Watson. The song is about a man's love for his wife, Harlan, and his love for the banjo. ""It was like this total relief to hear something so truly American and so truly awesome,"" he says."
"In every field, knowledge has exploded, but it has brought complexity, he says. ""We've come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize, as individualistic as we want to be, complexity requires group success,"" he adds. ""It seemed like time that we become that way ourselves"""
"Medical doctors used to be able to do everything a patient needed. They could give you an antiserum, an injection of antibodies to the bacterium streptococcus, if they sub-typed it correctly. A medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do. This was when the core structure of medicine was created."
"In the year 1970, it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians to care for a patient. By the end of the 20th century, it had become more than 15 clinicians for the same typical hospital patient. We have trained, hired and rewarded people to be cowboys. But it's pit crews that we need, pit crews for patients."
"The most expensive care is not necessarily the best care. 60 percent of our asthma, stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care. Two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn't have. The best care often turns out to be the least expensive."
"Having great components is not enough, and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components. We want the best drugs, the best technologies and the best specialists, but we don't think too much about how it all comes together. It's a terrible design strategy actually."
"The World Health Organization is trying to reduce deaths in surgery. The volume of surgery has spread around the world, but the safety of surgery had not. There's not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do."
"Boeing safety engineer designed a 19-item two-minute checklist for surgical teams. The checklist was implemented in eight hospitals around the world, deliberately in places from rural Tanzania to the University of Washington in Seattle. We found that after they adopted it the complication rates fell 35 percent."
"The average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win. Fark.com was sued along with Yahoo, MSN, Reddit, AOL, TechCrunch and others by a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources. The reason they settled out is because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit."
"The company's attorney: ""Ah, yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end."" Never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A. with no employees. ""If you can, don't fight the patent, fight the infringement,"" he says."
Patents are very difficult to overturn. Infringement is a lot easier to disprove. Make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money.
"The health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors, he says. The hi-tech industry would also like better protections for producers. And as a result, patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between. ""My solution: award me this patent and I will troll them out of existence,"" he adds."
"This is the first of 18 chapters in a new body of work titled ""A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters"" For this work, I traveled around the world over a four-year period researching and recording bloodlines. The subjects I documented ranged from feuding families in Brazil to victims of genocide in Bosnia."
The project centers on the collision of order and disorder -- the order of blood butting up against the disorder represented in the often chaotic and violent stories that are the subjects of my chapters. On the left are one or more portrait panels in which I systematically order the members of a given bloodline. And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.
"Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo treated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya for AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility, mental illness, evil spirits. He's most often paid for his services in cash, cows or goats. But sometimes when his female patients can't afford his services, their families give the women to Jura in exchange for medical treatment."
"The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia, and it competes with native wildlife and degrades the land. Since the 1950s, Australia has been introducing lethal diseases into the wild rabbit population to control growth. Haigh's Chocolate has stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby."
"During the Srebrenica massacre, 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were systematically executed. During the time I was in Bosnia, the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave. According to the Yadav family, the local court has been scheduling a case review since 2001."
"The State Council Information Office is responsible for all of China's external media operations. It also monitors the Internet and instructs local media on how to handle controversial issues. These are the descendants of Hans Frank, who was Hitler's personal legal advisor."
Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco is one of the nation's most violent regions. The Ferraz family and the Novaes family are in an active blood feud. The feud has been going on since 1991 in Northeast Brazil.
"In Ukraine, children are often forced to leave the orphanage at age 16. Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival, and high rates of suicide are recorded. The orphanage's most urgent needs are an industrial size washing machine and dryer."
LZ Granderson: It's not surprising that older people are happier. He says it's because they have less to worry about. LZ: But it's also because they are less likely to experience stress and anger. Lz: We need to make sure we don't repeat the mistakes of the past.
"Researchers have found that older people are happier than younger people. The study followed a group of people aged 18 to 94 over a 10-year period. They were asked to rate their happiness on a scale of one to seven. The older people were, the more positive they felt about life."
"Older people are more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions. Older people direct their attention and memory to positive information more than negative. In day-to-day life, this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction. The most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect the most."
"As we age, our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change. We take less notice of trivial matters. We savor life. We're more appreciative, more open to reconciliation. We might spend time with people we don't like because it's somehow interesting."
"By 2015, there will be more people in the U.S. over the age of 60 than under 15. ""Let's stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking to how to get them to save us all,"" says Bob Greene."
"Dental calculus is a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called dental calculus. It fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton, it's abundant in quantity before the present day and it's ubiquitous worldwide. We find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years. It's also found in neanderthals and animals."
"An archeological geneticist at the University of Zurich is studying the origins and evolution of human health and disease. Using ancient DNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies, he can generate immense quantities of data. He hopes to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies, so that we can improve and better manage our health."
"Inflationary theory already has strong observational support. If there are other universes, the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide. And if our universe got hit by another, that collision would generate an additional pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect."
"Brian Greene: We are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration. Greene: In part two, I'll offer a solution to that mystery. In part three, I'm going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation, which will pull the pieces of the story together."
"Brian Greene: Maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them. Greene: We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago -- and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look."
"In Einstein's theory of gravity, gravity can also push things apart. The repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space would cause each galaxy to push against every other, driving expansion to speed up, not slow down. Astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to explain cosmic speed up."
The only approach that's so far made headway to explain dark energy invokes the possibility of other universes. Part two of Jenny Zurawell's series on string theory. She explains how string theory is an approach to realizing Einstein's dream of a unified theory.
"The shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate. If we knew the shape, we could calculate the amount of dark energy. All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math. The list has grown from five to about 10 to the 500."
"Physicists believe there are many universes, each with a different shape for the extra dimensions. This means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured would take on a wholly different character. In this context, the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn't just one number."
"Physicists are used to giving definitive explanations for the features we observe. But if the feature you're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values, thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided. Kepler was asking the wrong question. Why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance?"
Cosmologists have found a mechanism that can generate other universes. The fuel is based on something called a quantum field. This fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up. This means the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event.
We asked people what they would do with their money if they could spend it on something else. One person said he would buy a house and live in it. The rest of the people said they would spend the money on themselves. We asked people to send us pictures of what they did with the money they received.
"Some people got a slip of paper that said, ""By 5pm today, spend this money on somebody else"" Some people bought coffee for themselves, the way they usually would. Others bought the same purchase, just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else."
"Human universal: you spend money on others, you're being nice. What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself. We see this again and again when we give people money to spend on others instead of on themselves. We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries."
"We wanted to look at every country in the world if we could, to see what the relationship is between money and happiness. What we see again is that the specific way you spend on other people isn't nearly as important as the fact that you spending on others makes you happy."
"Gallup Organization asked people to rate how happy they were with their lives. People who give money to charity are happier people than people who don't, researchers say. In almost every country, giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself."
"We give people on some teams some money ""Spend it however you want on yourself,"" just like we did with the undergrads in Canada. The teams we give the money to spend on each other become different teams; they dominate the league by the time they're done. So if you think money can't buy happiness, you're not spending it right."
Don't be afraid to ask for help. Don't give up on your dreams. Be the change you want to see in the world. Be a change you can see in your own life. Be your own best friend. Do what you want with your life.
"If you popped open the blueberry and were searching for the nucleus ... You know what? It would be invisible. The protons and neutrons live inside of the nucleus, and contain almost all of the mass of the atom. So if an atom is like a ball the size of a football stadium, with the nucleus in the center, what is in between the nucleus and the electrons? Surprisingly, the answer is empty space."
"The density of a typical nucleus is four times 10 to the 17th kilograms per meter cubed. Between the nucleus and the electrons, there are vast regions of empty space. ""I bet you haven't ever thought about how small atoms really are"""
The number of atoms in the Earth is 6.2 billion. That is almost equal to the number of people on the Earth. The atom is made up of vast regions of empty space. The nucleus has a crazy-high density. Think of putting all those cars in your one-foot box.
"CNN.com's iReporter: How many atoms are in a grapefruit? CNN.com reporter: How big would the grapefruit have to be to be the same size of the Earth?

"Mayor of Rio de Janeiro: A city of the future has to be environmentally friendly. Mayor: By 2050, there will be 6 billion people living in cities. Mayor of Curitiba: High-capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money."
"Rio de Janeiro is set to launch a new high-capacity transport network. The BRT will be the cheapest and fastest way to get around the city, says the mayor. The new system will see 63 percent of the city's population carried by high capacity transport."
"Rio de Janeiro has 6.3 million inhabitants -- more than 20 percent, 1.4 million, live in the favelas. ""You don't always have to be rich or powerful to get things done,"" says Rio Mayor Eduardo Campos."
"Rio de Janeiro has the aim, by 2020, to have all its favelas completely urbanized. ""A city of the future has to be socially integrated,"" says Rio Mayor Eduardo Campos. ""You've got to open spaces in the favela,"" Campos says."
"Between November and May, Rio's completely packed. We fight floods, tropical rains at this time of the year. Almost every year we have these landslides, which are terrible. You cannot deal with a city if it's not socially integrated."
"EP: How's the weather in Rio now? Osorio: The weather is fine. We have fair weather today. EP: Okay, how's the traffic? Osario: Well traffic tonight is fine, the streets are clear. Ep: How about the incidents of the day? Osio: Nothing of concern in terms of traffic."
The city's new waste collection system is in its third year of operation. The system is designed to reduce waste and improve the quality of life in the city. The city's first waste collection truck was delivered to the city in January. The second truck arrived in April. The third and fourth trucks were delivered in May.
"EP: A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party, which are cities. EP: We had to beat the most powerful man in the world defending his own city. Ep: And actually this last guy here said a phrase that I think fits perfectly to the situation of Rio winning the Olympic bid."

"Maezza's dad is black, and I knew this day was coming. I wasn't expecting it at seven, I don't know why, but I was not. The ships start in England, they come down from England. They go to Africa, they go across the ocean. They come to America, where the slaves are sold."
"Maezza, 7, wanted to play a game about the Middle Passage. Her father, a game designer, gave her a set of pieces to play with. She wanted to paint her family in different colors. The game turned into a nightmare for Maezza."
"The game is called ""The New World,"" because it's about the people who were brought over on slave ships. ""It was just an incredibly powerful experience. I'd been making games for 20-some years, and then I decided to do it again,"" says the game's creator."
"""I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics,"" Bast says. ""I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games,"" he says. Bast: ""For all of us, food is a basic need, and it is obviously with Mexicans"""

The Mall is a place where citizens can voice their opinions. It's also a place for the arts to have a voice. It could be used as a platform for political and social change. It is a unique place for art to have its voice.
"The Hirshhorn is a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early '70s by Gordon Bunshaft. The building will become a public forum, a place of discourse for issues around arts, culture, politics and policy."
"It's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures. Where would it go? It can't go in the Mall. In our imagination, it has to be light. And what language would it take? I don't know. It's a big question."
It's a giant airbag. It takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can. It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber and it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time. It had to be approved by actually two agencies.
"The Congressional Buildings Act of 1910 limits the height of buildings in D.C. except for spires, towers, domes and minarets. This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state. The bubble is 153 ft. high."
"It comes to the site twice a year. It glows from within, it's translucent. But it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments. So it's down the hierarchy on lighting. It's taken off the delivery truck and inflated with low-pressure air."
"Lincoln Center's new bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of 2013. The bubble is an anti-monument. The ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity. Art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls, but inside the museum's core."
"Every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution and what Hunter Lovins calls ""global weirding"" back at the power plant. Half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable, mainly lately in developing countries. Germany now has more solar workers than America has steel workers."
"Three-fourths of U.S. electricity comes from solar power. The rest comes from coal-fired power plants, which often break down. Wind and solar power can be used to replace the coal-powered plants, says John Defterios. Defterio: ""We need a new generation of power stations"""
"In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050. Whatever we replace it with is going to cost about six trillion dollars at present value. By 2050, it could become efficient, connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos."
"With today's much better technologies, more mature delivery channels and integrative design, we can do far more and even cheaper. We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply."
"""Reinventing Fire"" is a new book by David Frum. Frum: ""We can make the world richer, fairer, cooler and safer by together creating a new energy system"" He says the U.S. can save $5 trillion by switching from oil and coal to natural gas."
Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight. Carbon fiber composites can make cars simpler and cheaper to build. The resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers.
"Carbon fiber can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel. It can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos. If we made all of our autos this way, it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabias."
"In the five years ending with 2010, Walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks. Four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo. Saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks adds up to a $4 trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero."
"We can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells, electricity and advanced biofuels. The most we need is just three million barrels of oil a day. The long transition to electrified vehicles is already well under way. But they also have rising costs to our security, health and environment."
"Dow Chemical CEO: ""We've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions, rules and cultures"" Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars. Dow's 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building."
Industry has another half-trillion dollars of energy still to save. Three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors. Half of that runs pumps and fans. The motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements.
"The ""Double Raindrop"" is a collaboration with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek. The mechanism that drives it has nine motors and about 3,000 pulleys. The finished work's on tour and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks."

An entire industry has formed around tracking people on the Internet. The data is used to help people make better decisions about what to do. This is an area of the Internet that has very few regulations. It's an area that needs to be cleaned up.
"The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space is over 39 billion dollars today. Most all of the sites that are now tracking my personal information, most all of them without my consent. I look at this picture and it freaks me out. This is nothing."
Collusion is a tool that allows users to see who is tracking them on the Internet. The tool was developed by Mozilla and is available on the Firefox web browser. The company's founder says the tool will help parents protect their children's privacy.
"The Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us. And increasingly, the price we're being asked to pay is our privacy. We can't tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it."
"Analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain than those that are not branded. The reason for this is because perception is, in any case, leaky. If you do something that's perceptually bad in one respect, you can damage the other."
"CNN's John Defterios is the host of ""This Is Life"" on CNN.com. This week, he tackles the question of what it means to be a good person. He says it's important to be able to say ""I'm sorry"" for things you did."
"How you frame things really matters, says David Cameron. What you call them actually affects how you react to them, viscerally and morally. We don't have a really good model of human psychology, he says. This is what Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger calls ""a latticework"""
"Morton Bast: We have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model. Bast: In looking at solutions, we've probably given too much priority to technical engineering solutions, Newtonian solutions, and not nearly enough to the psychological ones. Bast says there's an imbalance, an asymmetry in the way we treat creative, emotionally driven psychological ideas."
"The single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the London Underground, per pound spent, came when they didn't add any extra trains, nor change the frequency of the trains. Red traffic lights have a countdown delay. It's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments. The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights."
"Google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one. Google understood that if you're just a search engine, people assume you're a very, very good search engine. I propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn't even realize were problems at all."
"Economics fails to understand that what something is is a function, not only of its amount, but also its meaning. Time means more to some people than others. The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone in the middle."
"Praxeology is the study of human choice, action and decision-making. It could revolutionize the way we pay for public services. The Austrian School of Economics considers it to be a prior discipline to psychology. But as Charlie Munger says, ""If it isn't behavioral, I don't know what it is"""
"Von Mises said that modern economists make the same mistake with regard to advertising and marketing. He says if you run a restaurant, there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking and sweeping the floor. The idea that one of them should have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong, he says."
"Tavi Gevinson: What makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws, who is maybe not immediately likable, but eventually relatable.

" classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over 1,000 years. It's so simple, so evocative. So many emotions seem to be inside of it. Yet, of course, like all music, it's essentially not about anything."
"Morton Bast's father, Ted, was a self-taught illustrator and musician. Bast: ""Much of my life, especially my musical life, is really a talk that I'm still having with him"" Bast: The impulse to notate, or, more exactly, encode music has been with us for a very long time."
"Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master. Every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason, instinct and intelligence. This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known. It's the music of the spheres."
"In 1600, the birth of opera put music on a radical new course. The what now was not to mirror the mind of God, but to follow the emotion turbulence of man. The chords, it turned out, were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions."
"New and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible. Beethoven said, ""There are only two things that matter in music: what and how"" But whatever direction the music took, one thing until recently was always the same, and that was when musicians stopped playing."
"""I was a South Indian. And two of the things about Bengal: they like their savory dishes and theylike their sweets"" ""It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it. And to me that's the most essential of all"""
"Researchers found that primates have far smaller stomachs than should be the size for our body weight and far larger brains. ""I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food and said, So we were hunter-gathers of information"""
"In the early days of farming, people were hunter-gatherers and cultivators of information. The two passions merged, and the journey of learning that took place from that point. The same is true every time as I started thinking about information, he says."
"Morton Bast: Information, if viewed from the point of food, is never a production issue. Bast: Are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it? Bast: We have to start thinking about how we create diets within ourselves."
"David Attenborough was born and raised in Calcutta, India. He says he grew up with books everywhere around the house. By the time he was 18, he had a deep passion for books. He has 38,000 of them now and no Kindle in sight."
"The fate of these bear families, and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific, depends on the salmon. That was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro-stabilized camera. But technology alone isn't enough to get the money shots, it's down to being in the right place at the right time."
"The tube-lipped nectar bat is a new species of bat discovered in Ecuador. The bat pollinated a unique flower using a tiny hole in the base of the flower. The series Untamed Americas hasn't even aired yet, so you're the very first to see this."
"The Altiplano in the high Andes of South America is the most otherworldly place I know. At 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air makes for perfect stargazing. The advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars with amazing clarity."
"CNN's John Defterios has been documenting the natural world for more than a decade. He says new technology is allowing him to capture the world in a new way. Defterio: ""It's a great time to be alive and to be a part of this world"""
"The author says great memories are learned, not innate. He says there are no shortcuts to great memories. ""Our lives are the sum of our memories,"" he says. ""We remember when we are deeply engaged with our memories"" ""This is how stuff is made memorable,"" he adds."
The United States Memory Championship takes place in New York City. Competitors compete to see who can memorize the order of a shuffled pack of cards. The winner is the person who can remember the most cards in the shortest amount of time. The winners are announced at the end of the competition.
"""I really want to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on U.S. national television,"" he says. ""I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory, but also investigating it,"" he adds."
CNN's John Defterios goes back to the roots of memory. He finds that it's not as simple as we think it is. It's not that we don't know how to do it. We just don't do it as well.
"The ""Baker paradox"" is the idea of trying to remember something without remembering it. It is the result of a process known as ""elaborative encoding"" where the brain tries to remember more quickly than the rest of the brain. The paradox is that the brain is constantly trying to recall more quickly."
The name Baker is untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull. The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person told his job is a baker. The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers into lower-case B bakers.
"Cicero's advice: Create an imagined edifice in your mind's eye and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember. The crazier, weirder, more bizarre, funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is, the more unforgettable it's likely to be."
"CNN's John Defterios writes a weekly column on the state of the world. This week, he looks at the impact of the recession on the U.S. economy. He also looks at what's happening in the world at the moment, and what's coming."
"CNN's John Sutter tries to remember things he saw in the New York Times. Sutter: ""What you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better at creating, at dreaming up, these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious, and hopefully unforgettable images"""
Renny Gleeson: What I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it. They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page. It turned into a 24-hour contest.
"CNN's John Sutter explains what a 404 page is. He says it's the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it. Sutter: A simple mistake can tell me what you're not, or remind me of why I should love you."
"Half the world's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite. Every 30 seconds, somewhere on this planet, a child dies of malaria. But perhaps if we can attract these mosquitoes to traps, bait it with our smell, we may be able to stop transmission of disease."
The smell of a piece of Limburger cheese has been found to attract mosquitoes. The smell is similar to the smell of human feet. The cheese is now being used in the fight against malaria in Africa. It has been shown to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitoes than human scent.
The problem is that the larvae are scattered all over the landscape. We can now use dogs to find these pools of water. The dogs can then be used to kill the larvae. This is a big step in the right direction for the fight against malaria in the UK.
Dogs can find people with parasites and treat them with antimalarial drugs. The drugs are the final blow to malaria. People have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes. The only good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes is a tablet.
"CNN's John Defterios shows how quickly mosquitoes bite. Defterio: ""We follow them through time to see these mosquitoes get very, very sick indeed"" ""They don't kill us. We kill them,"" he says. ""That's fascinating"""
"Scientists have discovered that the smell of a woman's body can attract and repel mosquitoes. If everyone took the same drug for three weeks, malaria could be eliminated. The drug could also be used to contain outbreaks of mosquito-born diseases, like malaria."
"Out of four British people, three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families. But only 30 percent said they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago. But private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent. And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay."
"The optimism bias has been observed in many different countries, in Western cultures, in females and males, in kids, in the elderly. Some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations. But the question is, is it good for us?"
"Psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown studied students with high and low expectations. They found that when people with high expectations succeed, they attribute that success to their own traits. People with low expectations do the opposite. Regardless of the outcome, the pure act of anticipation makes us happy."
"In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent. But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce, they estimate it at zero percent. What I wanted to know was what was going on inside the human brain that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally."
"The more optimistic you were, the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information. The more optimistic a person is, the more likely they are to remarry. Scientists hope to alter people's optimism bias by interfering with the brain activity in these regions."
"CNN's John Sutter tests the effect of the optimism bias on people's thinking. Sutter: ""We were able to eliminate a deep-rooted bias in humans. After that everything goes back to normal"" Sutter will use his findings to teach people to be more aware of their own biases."
"The British government has adjusted its budget for the 2012 Olympic Games to reflect the risk of underestimating the cost of projects. The key is to be aware of the dangers of optimism and to remain hopeful, says Dr. Andrew Keen. ""We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases,"" he says."
"There are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War, but only four that are 100 times deadlier -- like World War I. mathematical analysis suggests that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this, which lies in our brains."
"Morton Bast: I think there's a belief that it's just impossible, that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind. But I don't think that's right. And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language. It will be able to reveal new trends in our history."
"In English, if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another, it regularizes 10 times slower. Erez: I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have, that you don't do things. He met a psychologist who had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias."
"In the third grade, Bandura taught a class about the fear of snakes. The students were cured of their fear by a step-by-step process, he says. Bandura calls this process ""guided mastery,"" and he says he loves the term."
"Bandura: ""We could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative, and we could take them through a series of steps"" ""They turn fear into familiarity. And they surprise themselves,"" he says. ""That transformation is amazing,"" he adds."
"Morton Bast: I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence. Bast: Doug was really disappointed to learn that nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine. He painted the walls and he painted the machine, and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids, like children's museum people."
CNN's John Sutter tells the story of a young girl who was diagnosed with cancer. She had to be sedated and had to spend the night in the hospital. Sutter says the girl's story made him want to help others in similar situations.
"The TED Talk is hosted by CNN's iReport. CNN.com's John Sutter is a producer and host of the TED Talk series, ""TED Talk Tuesdays"" Sutter talks about his TED Talk, which airs at 10 p.m. ET/PT on Tuesday, July 25."
Golgi stain is a type of light that can be used to make neurons glow. It was developed to help scientists understand how the brain works. It can also be used as a tool to help people understand their own neurons. The light can also help people learn more about their own brains.
"Neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons, molecules, rather than the entire cell. antibodies are useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules, like the coat protein of a virus that's invading the body. Researchers have used this fact in order to identify specific molecules inside of the brain."
"The brain is more complex today than it was 1,000 years ago. Scientists can see what's inside of the brain, rather than just looking at its overall shape. Green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both natural products at the get-go. They were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green."
"Inside Out is a series of TED Talk videos that chronicle the life and work of the founder of the organization. The first video is about the Golgi stain, a stain that stains about one percent of cells in a tissue. The second is a look at some of the people who have used Inside Out to change the world."
"Portraits of the unseen faces of the city are being pasted on walls in Karachi, Pakistan and North Dakota. Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border of Juarez. While in Iran at the same time Abololo -- of course a nickname -- has pasted one single face of a woman."
"Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools. Kids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them, they paste them on the school. These projects took thousands of actions in one year, making hundreds of thousands of people participating, creating millions of views."
CNN's John Sutter asks: Can art change the world? Sutter: I think we can. Let's turn the world inside out. We need to change the way we think about the world. Let us know what you think in the comments below.
"The Exo Housing Unit is a modular housing system that can react to any situation or disaster. It can be put up in any environment, from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields, because it doesn't require special setup or specialty tools. One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year."
"On average, 31 and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year. 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself. The Exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option."
"CNN's John Defterios is working with the U.S. Geological Survey on a project to create a new type of ""virus"" He says the project could be used to help people who have lost loved ones in natural disasters. Defterius: ""We are going to make this project a reality. We are not going to let it die."""
"Scientists have discovered that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before. ""It's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information,"" says Dr. Richard Branson."
"Up to 50 percent of the world's DNA is made up of dark matter. Scientists are trying to find out what this dark matter could be used for. The discovery could lead to the discovery of a new class of life, says Dr. David Wheeler."
"CNN's John Defterios asks: Is there anything left for us to do on Earth? He asks: Will the number of children in the world increase or will it stay the same? The answer is yes, he says, it will continue to grow."
"Gapminder created a map of the world's religions based on population size. Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East, Southern Europe and through Asia. Christianity, Islam and Buddhism are divided into many subgroups."
"In 1960, you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies in most countries. The exception was Japan. But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman. Countries with Islam as the majority religion almost had 6 to seven children per woman, irregardless of the income level."
"By 2010, 80 percent of humans live in countries with about two children per woman, he says. France, Russia, Iran, Mexico, Turkey, Algeria, Indonesia, India and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam have the same amount of babies per woman."
"Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa. Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo, which have suffered severe conflicts, that they don't have fast population growth. But 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million."
"The impact of religions on the number of babies per woman will be discussed in this week's episode of CNN's ""Religion and State"" The show will also feature a look at the impact of religion on children in Bangladesh and Qatar. The episode will be broadcast on Thursday, November 14, at 9pm ET on CNN."
"The average number of children in the world is like in Colombia -- it's 2.4 today. We are still debating peak oil, but we have definitely reached peak child. There are countries up here which are very poor. That's where family planning, better child survival is needed."
The United Nations Population Division has said it will stop growing at 10 billion. But why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow? Well I will show you here. I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came. Each card box is one billion people.
"Before 1980, there were much fewer people born than there were during the last 30 years. The old, sadly, we will die. The rest of you, you will grow older and you will get two billion children. It's inevitable."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at how the world has changed since he was born. The world has gone from one billion people to almost two billion, he says. Defterio: ""It's amazing what has happened in the last 100 years. It's incredible"""
"When he was six years old, Timothy Covell fell in love with magic. Covell was given a magic box and a book on card manipulation for Christmas. He was able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven cards in 20 seconds. He shows you the most difficult move in the book."
"When he was six years old he was taught how to juggle by a famous magician. The move had to be less than one second and it has to be perfect for it to be a professional. The magician told him: ""You cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing"""
"Philippe L'Heureux: ""I was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all. The clubs were escaping me at each throw"" ""Tenacity is how I kept at it against all odds,"" he says. ""I just created the widest tightrope in the world"""
"""I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection,"" he says. ""It was dreaming time. And I developed a faith that I will get safely to the other side"" ""I am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers, I am my own teacher"""
"The World Trade Center in New York City is one of the tallest buildings in the world. The tower is made up of 60 yards of wire rope. The cable is three tons tight, ready to explode, says the author. ""It's a straight line, which sags, which vibrates, which rolls on itself, which is ice,"" he says."
"Philippe Rochat: ""I was not interested in collecting the gigantic, in breaking records"" ""For an hour and a half I shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity, how I pursue perfection,"" he says. ""I put my World Trade Center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks"""
"Ilya Shapiro was invited to open the Israel Festival by a high-wire walk over the Ben Hinnom Valley. He thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire he stopped and, like a magician, he produced a dove and sent her in the sky as a living symbol of peace. Shapiro: improvisation is empowering because it welcomes the unknown."
"""There was tension in my wire, but I also could feel tension on the ground,"" he says. ""Because all those people were made up of people who, for the most part, considered each other enemies"" ""So the best way for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity,"" he adds. ""So I grab the dove, and for the second time I send her in the air"""
The kingdom is one of about 50 countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with HIV. The kingdom argues that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy or the security. The laws are a violation of international human rights agreements to which these countries are signatories.
"In the age of science, we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition. We are very far from the days when the only practical response to dread disease was to have banished the afflicted. HIV brings out the best and the worst in humanity. And the laws reflect these attitudes."
"Nick Rhoades was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law on HIV transmission and exposure. Some countries have good laws, laws which could stem the tide of HIV. These laws fly in the face of science, and are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance."
"In 2010 1.8 million people died of AIDS related causes, according to recent estimates. In some parts of the world, new infections are rising and so are deaths. Only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it. The money, the money we need for the global response to HIV, is shrinking."
"One in every 10 new infections of HIV is among people who inject drugs. Drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country. But some countries take a harder line on this than others. In Thailand people who use drugs, or are merely suspected of using drugs, are placed in detention centers."
"Australia and Switzerland introduced harm reduction very early on in their HIV epidemics. Thailand and Russia have resisted harm reduction and have stringent laws which punish drug use. The U.S. and Malaysia came to harm reduction a little later, and they have higher rates of HIV."
"HIV is not an abstract threat. It hits very close to home. The law, on the other hand, can seem remote, arcane, the stuff of specialists, but it isn't. Laws that treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk with respect start with the way that we treat them ourselves: as equals."
"""TED"" host says he wrote a song about people and sasquatches -- and other French science stuff. ""It will get here, there's no question. Not just any day, but it is a day,"" he says. ""I've been trying inside I know that I'm in trouble"""
"phthalmologist's final piece is a simulation of the world we live in. ""It's believable, it's tactile. You can reach out -- things are solid,"" he says. ""You can move objects from one area to another"" ""That's something you live inside of every day"""
phthalmologist: It is within our self-interest to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves. The future states that there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living.
"""I was trying to build a robot that could do all the heavy lifting for me,"" he says. ""It was the 1970s, and the technology just wasn't there yet"" He says he's been working on the project ever since. ""I'm still working on it, but it's a long way off"""
"The Telegarden was an engineering project that became an art installation. The robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history. It was invited by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria to have it installed in their lobby. It remained online, 24 hours a day, for almost nine years."
"The Tele-Actor was a robot that went into a remote environment and interacted with people over the Internet. The project was inspired by a 10-year-old boy who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true. ""Telepistemology"" is the study of knowledge at a distance."
Morton Bast: I think robots can inspire us to be better humans. Bast: The success of the Tele-Actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor. Bast's father was undergoing a treatment -- chemotherapy treatments -- and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy.
"The robot can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets they're aiming for. The idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame. Many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious, like suturing, and currently, all of these are performed under the specific control of the surgeon."
"Researchers at Berkeley have developed a new way to teach robots to fly. They use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition. They then apply Kalman filtering, a technique from control theory, that allows them to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory."
"The project also has a lesson, which is: if you want to do something well, there's no substitute for practice. The field of robotics has gotten much better over time. Now, high school students can build robots, like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build."
"To get 16 lightbulbs per person, you'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map. That's a fourfold increase over today's levels of nuclear power. You ask a question, write down some numbers, and get an answer."
"""We need to stop shouting and start talking,"" says UK environment minister. ""If we can have a grown-up conversation, make a plan that adds up and get building, maybe this low-carbon revolution will actually be fun,"" he adds."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at the energy consumption of the United Kingdom. The UK has 125 lightbulbs per person, compared to the world's total energy use of 1,000. Defterio: ""It's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in our country"""
"The United Kingdom peaked in coal production in 1918, and has declined ever since. Most countries are going to the right, and they're going up. The United Kingdom is off in the top right-hand corner, accompanied by Germany, Japan and South Korea."
The United Kingdom is consuming 1.25 watts per square meter. Half of the world's population lives in countries that are already above that line. Renewables is one of the leading ideas for how we could get off our 90 percent fossil-fuel habit.
"CNN's John Defterios talks to Morton Bast about how to get off fossil fuels. Defterio: ""I'm absolutely not anti-renewables. I love renewables. But I'm also pro-arithmetic"" ""What is life after fossil fuels going to be like?"" Bast asks."
"All renewables, much as I love them, are diffuse. They all have a small power per unit area, and we have to live with that fact. If you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the United Kingdom, you need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country-sized."
"The UK could reduce demand, and that means reducing population -- I'm not sure how to do that -- or reducing per capita consumption. Australia, Russia, Libya, Kazakhstan could be our best friends for renewable production. And a third option is nuclear power."
"Electric bikes and electric cars are four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol-powered tank. Heating is a third of our energy consumption in Britain, and quite a lot of that is going into homes and other buildings. There's this remarkable technology called a thermostat: you grasp it, rotate it to the left."
"The third way to reduce energy consumption is to read your meter. You can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness of your building. If you want to get closer to Swedish building standards, you need to put external insulation on."
"The prayer book was discovered by Johan Ludvig Heiberg, in 1906. With just a magnifying glass, he transcribed as much of the text as he could. The book is the definition of a write-off. It got in worse condition in the 20th century."
The book was written in ancient Greek. It was intended to be a guide to how to write a book. But it was written as a guide for people who wanted to write their own book. The book is now in the hands of a group of scholars.
It took four years to remove all the wax from the manuscript. The book was used in the liturgical services of the Greek Orthodox Church. The image was taken in 14 different wavebands of light to show the different parts of the book.
"Images of the Archimedes manuscript were created using 14 different wavebands of light. If you merge them together into one digital canvas, the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright. The prayer book is dark in one image and bright in another."
"The manuscript was last heard of in the Pope's Library about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in 1311. It sheds an X-ray that is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits. Electrons go around one way, positron go around the other."
"The Codex C was only discovered in 1906, and it landed on my desk in Baltimore on the 19th of January, 1999. It took about 17 minutes to do a single page. It's 17,152 divided into 536 families. He was trying to work out how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits."
Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C. He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes. Hyperides found himself on trial for treason. He gave a great speech that the Athenian law courts let him off.
"Aristotle's ""Categories"" is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy. It was written in the third century by a man called Johannes Myrones. All the images and transcriptions have been put online under a Creative Commons license."
"All the manuscripts have been put on the Web under a Creative Commons license. The site is intended to be used by people who want to curate their own beautiful things. ""It's an attractive and beautiful future, if only we can make it happen,"" says founder of the site."
"Unemployment and poverty alone did not lead to the Arab revolts of 2011. In 2010, even though GDP per capita had been growing at five percent for several years, Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives. In Egypt, people feel better as their country gets richer because they have better job opportunities."
"As the country got more well-off, unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted. Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory, Arabs didn't despise Western liberty, they desired it. Eighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help Muslims progress."
"Morton Bast: Egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years. He says they expect to be active participants, not spectators, in their country. Bast: If Egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law, it could be a model."
"Before the revolution, most Egyptians thought their future would be no better. After the ouster of Mubarak, people's expectations for their future went up significantly. 90 percent thought that this last election was honest, according to Gallup. Gallup: Egyptians' elevated expectations are placed first on themselves."
"A third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt were women. Three-fourths believe they not only have the responsibility, but the power to make change. Women in one country look more like the men in that country than their female counterparts across the border."
"What drives men's support for women's employment is men's employment, their level of education. Human development, not secularization, is what's key to women's empowerment in the transforming Middle East. ""From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street, it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people"""
"Every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status, we're actually positively endorsing this as a good and normal thing to care about. That way, possibly having a detrimental effect on the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture."
"The author asks: Is it a good thing that all of us continuously self-optimize ourselves to fit better into that society? ""My values can be radically different from your values,"" he says. ""Ethics was about the question of how to live well,"" he adds."
"Designers are not ethical in that they're using ethical or unethical means of persuading us. They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us. No matter whether we as designers intend it or not, we materialize morality."
"Even something as innocuous as a single-design chair, like this one by Arne Jacobsen, is a persuasive technology. The question of what the good life is informs everything that we design. Why should the lamp or the house be an art object, but not our life?"
"Habits: ""We take care of our own health and manage our own burnout"" ""We are the be-all and end-all of all creation"" ""There are two theories of the case as to why we're all here"""
"There were only about 2,000 of our species left when we came close to extinction. The reason for trillions of galaxies, sextillions of planets, is to create something that looks like that. The only question you might want to ask yourself is, could that be just mildly arrogant?"
"The difference between humans and Neanderthal is 0.004 percent of gene code. This explains most contemporary political debates. And as it continues, one of the things that's going to happen this year is we're going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes."
"Every male Olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants. If that is true, it leads to some very complicated questions for the London Olympics. We're going to know at year end if that's true. And by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for."
"CNN's John Sutter asks: Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase for really hardworking mutants? Sutter: If these differences are the difference between an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal, we may just be in some of these weeks. He says we human beings really like to change how we look, how we act, what our bodies do."
"In theory, you could grow any organ from any one of your cells. You can take, not just mouse cells, but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells. If you could photocopy your body, maybe you also want to take your mind."
"The brain is the first place where you would expect to see enormous evolutionary pressure today. The brain is reacting in a hyperactive, hyper-plastic way, and creating individuals that are like this. It's not completely inconceivable that someday you'll be able to download your own memories."
"There are four theories as to why this might be going on, plus a whole series of others. One option is the fast food fetish. There's beginning to be some evidence that obesity and diet have something to do with gene modifications, which may or may not have an impact on the brain of an infant."
"""We're transitioning into Homo evolutis that, for better or worse, is a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species"" ""We're trying to process so much stuff that some people get synesthetic and just have huge pipes that remember everything"""
"The penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion, but when internal fertilization evolves, penises often follow. Most of the time it's a flexible organ. It's easy to bend. But before it's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid."
"CNN's John Defterios is a leading expert on the human penis. He has spent more than 30 years studying the human body. Defterio: ""I'm not sure this project is going to pan out"" He says it's important to find out how the penis works and why it's so important."
"The model skeleton is made out of a piece of cloth that I wrapped around an inflated balloon. The fibers wrap in helices, and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves, which means the skeleton's flexible. It lengthens, shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces."
"Researchers found a new way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton. The fibers are arranged at 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure. This way, unlike the cross helical model, this model resists extension and contraction. It's an observation with obvious medical applications in humans."
"The study of invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems. ""We often focus on one disease, one model, one problem, but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems,"" he says."
"X is the unknown because you can't say ""sh"" in Spanish. X was the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years. The X prize, the X-Files, Project X, TEDx are all references to the letter X."
Morton Bast: Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce 900 million liters per day of desalinated water. Bast: This equates to a $4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore -- a place that doesn't have any natural resources. Bast shows stop-motion footage of bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour.
Desalination is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water. The process is very expensive and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe. The brine produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.
"Philippe Starck's citrus juicer is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time. It is a monument to design's utility, unlike the Theme Building, which will stay where it is forever. This is affordable and can come home with you, as such, it can sit on your kitchen counter."
"John Hodgman shows off his well-loved iPhone. Hodgman: This is a design that once you saw it, you forgot about it. John Hodgman is a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs."
The Theme Building is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture. Scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era. It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located at Stonehenge.
"Autistic people have a very special perspective on the world, and we need diversity. They learn about the world almost, like, about it, rather than learning how to function in it. We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths, but to fulfill their promise."
"Babies prefer to look at people rather than at things. They learn to follow other people's gazes, because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about. The social mind, the social brain, depends on attention, he says."
"Morton Bast: It's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction. Bast: We intuit other people's feelings; we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen. ""I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement,"" Bast says."
Autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders. It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born. There are millions of individuals with autism all around us. The societal cost of this condition is huge in the US alone.
"The median age of diagnosis in the U.S. is five years old. Early treatment for autism can have long-term benefits, says Dr. David Perry. Perry: ""No science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact on the community"""
"There are between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism, according to experts. The first two years of a child's life are the most crucial for development. ""We had to basically step inside a body. We had to see the world through her eyes"""
"In a new study, researchers freeze a video of 35 typically developing two-year-olds. The children with autism focus on the revolving door, opening and shutting. The results show that the children's brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers."
"Researchers looked at children from the time they're born to the age of 24 months. The children were isolated from the world around them, from their environment and from the people. Using these kinds of measures and many others, our science could, in fact, identify this condition early on."
"The New York Times ran a story about a gang rape of a young girl, 11 years old, in a small Texas town. The Times was deluged with criticism. The problem is, of course, there aren't enough women in newsrooms."
The New York Times revisits the story of a young girl who was raped numerous times by many men. The Global Media Monitoring Project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters. Elaine Baumgartel did some graduate research on the coverage of violence against women.
Women are more likely to be defined by their body parts. Stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men. The editor of Wired defended his choice and said there aren't enough women in technology to cover an issue.
"A recent global survey found that 73 percent of the top media-management jobs are still held by men. Shankar Vedantam: We make up half the population of the world, but we're just 24 percent of news subjects quoted in news stories. Vedantam is the author of ""The Hidden Brain"""
"Lara Logan was the CBS News correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt's Tahrir Square. With today's technology, it's possible to remove women from the picture completely. One way to get more women into leadership is to have other women mentor them."
CNN's John Sutter looks at how we see the world from different perspectives. Sutter: We'd be better off if we all had the same view of the world. He says women make up less than 20 percent of the workforce in many countries.
"The song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it. You gotta make it your own. Show everyone what you intend,"" is what he said. Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner, but he was another man."
"CNN's John Sutter was in a car crash that killed two people 36 years ago. Sutter: ""My life, at the mercy of good design and bad design"" ""My dad was, which is kind of an interesting way to grow up,"" Sutter says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his son's wheelchair. Sutter: ""I wouldn't shower for a week -- nothing worked. I had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important"" ""What you are looking at here has completely changed my life,"" Sutter says."
"""I am no designer, nope, no way. I am the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front"" ""We have a huge problem with intent. Look at this guy. You know who this is? It's Anders Breivik"""
"As an intentional murderer, Anders Breivik is merely evil. But as a dysfunctional murderer/psychotic, he's something much more complicated. We may put him away for life, but we watch him clinically. It's as though intent is an essential component for humanity."
"The technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord-injured males was invented by a veterinarian. ""I wasn't exactly a form of birth control. My wife was so pissed,"" he says. ""The experience is completely different. He's like our other children, but the experience is different"""
"Ajax came out of nowhere. But we all had to change, but not just react to the given. We bend to this new experience with intent. That's what I love about it. It's something like my accident, right?"
"Plato was trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive. The given was replaced by various aspects of intent, by various designs. Reality itself needed a designer. Today we don't confront the chaos of nature. Today it is the Chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront."
"CNN's John Defterios recalls his time in Zaire in the 1990s. He was in a wheelchair and reporting from the city of Kinshasa. ""I didn't look like a journalist, particularly, that's for sure,"" he says."

"Morton Bast is the co-founder of Health Leads, a group of college student advocates. Bast: Doctors and nurses prescribe nutritious food, heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication. Patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well-trained student advocates who work side-by-side with these families."
"Dr. Jack Geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in the U.S. in 1965. Geiger's patients came in presenting with malnutrition and he began prescribing food for them. Today Health Leads connects nearly 9,000 patients and their families with the resources that they need."
"Health Leads is a new program that uses sub-specialty referrals to help patients get the care they need. The goal is to make sure patients are getting the right care, not just the right medications. The program is being rolled out across the U.S."
"Every day in this country three million patients pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms. In the private sector, when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed-cost investment, it's called a billion-dollar company. It's called healthcare -- a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health."
Health Leads aims to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy. The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player dedicates 39 hours a week to his sport. What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the 11 million college students in this country?
"Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine at UCSF Medical Center. As an undergraduate, she was a Health Leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center, she says. She says there's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who've spent two, three, four years talking to patients."
"Rebecca Kohn: ""I grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients"" Kohn's idea of Health Leads was to mobilize college students to address patients' most basic health needs. ""I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country,"" Kohn says."
"Filmmaker David Walliams set up FILMCLUB in 2006 to run weekly film screenings in schools. The films were curated and contextualized. The outcome, immediate and profound, was an education of the most profound and transformative kind."
" FILMCLUB is celebrating democracy and government with a selection of classic films. The film ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is older than most of our members' grandparents. The speed with which they associate it with ""Slumdog Millionaire"" speaks to the enduring nature of the film."
"Children from all ages and cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form. From 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands, until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7,000 clubs right across the country. Some of our kids started talking with their parents, others with their teachers, or with their friends."
"The author's mother left Europe in a hurry with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt. The author's father was never right again and his story was hushed as he assimilated. The writer's aunt is a wonderful storyteller, who can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain."
" FILMCLUB is a film club for young people in the UK. The group says its members are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed. They are negotiating a world with infinite choice, but little culture of how to find meaningful experience."
"The city of Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years. The Nile used to flow right next to the city, and as it shifted and changed and moved over time, it covered over the city. Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack."
"Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of pottery. We also found work stone -- carnelian, quartz and agate that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here. No Itjtawy was here yet, but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future."

"CNN's John Sutter talks about his client, Will, who was executed for a crime he didn't commit. Sutter: ""I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment"" He says he wants to talk about the death penalty in a way that is entirely noncontroversial."
"Death row is a four-part story. The first two chapters involve the execution of a person. The third chapter involves the appeal of the death sentence. The fourth chapter is the final chapter, when the execution is carried out. The last chapter ends with the execution."
"In a typical year in Texas, we're averaging about two people a month. The number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down. Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in Texas is at an all-time low."
"Death penalty lawyers have understood that the earlier you intervene in a case, the greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life. 80 percent of the people on death row are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that Will did."
CNN's John Sutter looks at the four chapters of a man's life that led to his death. Sutter asks: How can we intervene in the life of a murderer before he's a murderer? Sutter: The way to solve a problem is to make it bigger.
"There are 3,000 possible strategies that we could embrace in order to nudge kids like Will off of the path that they're on. We could be providing early childhood care for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids, and we could be doing it for free. There are other states that do that, but we don't."
"There are two professors in the Northeast -- one at Yale and one at Maryland -- they set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison. They had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison, they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities. But they did all those things."

"Every aspect of your life has been medicalized. We've medicalized everything in this country. Every single one of you has it, because you have the risk factor for it, which is being alive. If you can survive to the end of my talk, which we'll see if that happens, you will be a pre-vivor."
"Cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor, but hasn't actually had that cancer, to call themselves a pre-vivor.

"Tesla has over 700 patents to his name: radio, wireless telegraphy, remote control, robotics. He even photographed the bones of the human body. The high point was the realization of a childhood dream: harnessing the powers of Niagara Falls, and bringing light to the city."
Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered. He became a recluse. He spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria. His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum.
"Magician tells the story of the birth of Nikola Tesla, the inventor of the Tesla coil. Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way when a word was mentioned, an image of it instantly appeared in his mind. A colleague of mine did analysis on different football, World Cups, Olympic Games around the world, looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort people have perceived at these different sport activities."
"Qatar will host the football World Cup 10 years from now, 2022. The air temperature in Qatar is expected to be between 25 and 35 degrees C. This is because there are more parameters influencing our thermal comfort. These include the sun, the diffuse sun, strong wind, mild wind and air humidity."
Qatar has been assigned to host the World Cup in 2014. The country has a temperature of 32 degrees Celsius perceived temperature. The Bid Book aims for outdoor comfort in this range. The stadium has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort. It needs to protect against strong and warm wind.
"""We are not using fossil energies. We are using energy we can harvest on our roofs,"" he says. ""We will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics,"" he adds. ""This energy is necessary to condition a World Cup in Qatar, the next 20 years"""

"Morton Bast: In science and all its applications, what is crucial is not that technical ability, but it is imagination. Bast: Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake. ""The world needs you, badly,"" he says."
"There is going to be no turning back. Observe from a distance, but do not join the fray. When the subject is still very thinly populated, you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority. The world needs this kind of expertise and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it."
"In the attempt to make scientific discoveries, every problem is an opportunity. The more difficult the problem, the greater will be the importance of its solution. For every problem in a given discipline of science, there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution, he says."

CNN's John Sutter has created a new way to see the Earth from space. Sutter's new video shows the Earth as seen from the International Space Station. The interactive video can also be used to see Earth from the perspective of a space shuttle.
"Nye: NASA is far from dead, and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there's so many other things that we're doing. While we're here, again, if you want to visit anything, all you need to do is double-click. You can see Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons."
"Voyager 1 flies by Titan, which is a hazy moon of Saturn. Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at I think it's 38,000 miles per hour. With a 3D visualization, we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn. There's a whole story to tell here."
"Voyager 1 flies by Saturn, then Saturn grabs it and flings it out of the solar system. You can see the United States and California and San Diego, and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around. The theme of the program is ""The World In Your Grasp"""
"India has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services, as we call it. But many in the West say Indians don't have the skills to do the work, so they go to Silicon Valley. But when they go there, they find that most of the people working there are from India."
"In the last two decades, there have been 750 R&amp;amp;D centers set up in India by multinational companies employing more than 400,000 professionals. The innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we called it ""invisible innovation"" There are four types of invisible innovation coming out of India."
"Many companies today are contracting Indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products. For example, XCL Technologies developed two of the mission critical systems for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations, because of an injection of intelligence."
"The most significant management innovation to come out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry, is what we call the global delivery model. The model allows you to take previously geographically core-located tasks, break them up into parts, send them around the world and then reintegrate them."
"IBM is considered to be one of the most innovative companies in the world. There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which 98,000 are remaining in the U.S., and 150,000 in India. In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time the U.-S. employees had moved to 105,000."
"The Tropic of Capricorn is one of the most active areas of the solar system. It is the only place in the world where the sun doesn't reach the equator. The Tropic is also home to the world's largest species of beetle, the Steller's ant."
"Between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet, including plants, are beetles. There are beetles that roll little balls of dung across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings. Fireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well."
The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar. The link to cave paintings takes you to some of the oldest art known to humankind. It's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if you eat it orally.
"The Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that it is going out of print after 244 years. The link I clicked on here, well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar. In between those two landmarks in Ham's life, he flew into space."
"The International Space Station synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit, at the exact same time of day. The furthest point from the center of the Earth is the tip of Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid, less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls."
"The summit of Mount Chimborazo is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth. At the heart of this printer there is something I'm really attached to: these Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of powers this printer. It's an open-source project."
"With Arduino, we have kids like Sylvia that you see here, that actually make projects with Arduino. I have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me stuff they built for Arduino that's really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them the tools. This is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics."
Arduino itself is made of a lot of different open-source components that maybe individually are hard to use for a 12-year-old kid. The idea that you can manufacture objects digitally using these machines is something that The Economist magazine defined as the Third Industrial Revolution.
"Matt Richardson: There is another revolution going on, and it's the one that has to do with open-source hardware and the maker's movement. This Arduino project, which I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime any of these over-exposed personalities is mentioned."
"Arduino is an open-source technology that lets people make anything from a printer to a chair that twitters when somebody farts. The technology is also being used to create interfaces between mobile phones, tablets and the real world. There's a lot of innovation happening because it's all open- source, and there's also a large community of people using it."
"The Accessory Development Kit from Google is open-source and based on Arduino, as opposed to the one from Apple which is closed-source, NDA, sign your life to Apple. You don't need anybody's permission to create something great. The group of people that started this company called Pebble, they prototyped a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone, and you can display information on it."
"The Arduino community is helping to create a new age of networked intelligence. ""I wake up and I look at all the stuff that Google Alerts sends me, and it's just amazing,"" says creator. ""These kids are different. They have no fear of technology, because it's not there."""
"Technology, demographic kick from a new generation and a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up. ""We're at a turning point in human history, where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the Industrial Age around a new set of principles,"" he says."
"Don Tapscott: ""The boundaries of organizations are becoming more porous and fluid and open"" He tells the story of Rob McEwen, a gold miner who found 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold. ""Conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right? Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night"""
"The technology revolution is opening the world. Openness is about collaboration. This is different. Here, we're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations: employees, customers, business partners, shareholders, and so on. And everywhere, our institutions are becoming naked. People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks, but that's just the tip of the iceberg."
" Institutions are becoming naked, and if you're going to be naked, well, there's some corollaries that flow from that. You need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization, because if you don't, you'll be unable to build trust. The Internet of today is a platform for computation."
"The pharmaceutical industry is about to fall off a patent cliff, says Richard Branson. Branson: ""We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research"" The pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets in a commons, Branson says. ""In doing so, create a rising tide that could lift all boats,"" he says."
"In the Tunisian revolution, the new media didn't cause the revolution; it was caused by it. For these kids, it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers. So this is a time of great change. The open world is bringing freedom."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at how the world is moving towards openness. Defterio: ""The train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag"" The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom, he says. ""I think, at the end of these four days, that the arc of history is a positive one"""
"The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge. The Internet gives us access, not just to information and knowledge, but to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people. To me, this is not an information age, it's an age of networked intelligence. The boundaries of our organizations are changing."
"The murmuration is a huge collaboration of birds. Scientists have said they've never seen an accident. There's a real sense of interdependence, that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interest of the collective. Perhaps like we should understand that business can't succeed in a world that's failing."
"Schizophrenia is a brain disease. Its defining feature is psychosis, or being out of touch with reality. Delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness. When I'm psychotic I often have the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands of people. I sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain."
Schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality. It presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status. There are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities. It is not a disorder that can be cured by medication.
"Every week in the United States, it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints. It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives. ""We don't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would,"" says a psychiatrist."
"Professor Elyn Saks has schizophrenia. Saks says she has had excellent treatment and a supportive workplace. She says the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that she didn't feel safe with people knowing about her illness. She is now receiving treatment in New Haven, Connecticut."
" schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects people of all ages and backgrounds. We need to invest more resources into research and treatment of mental illness. We must stop criminalizing mental illness, he says. He says he doesn't wish to be seen as regretting the life he could have had if he'd not been mentally ill."
"Inside a superconductor there are no collisions, so there is no energy dissipation. This is a quantum effect. These are not particles, but they behave like particles. So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking."
"Superconductor doesn't like strands of magnetic field left inside, because their movements dissipate energy. Superconductor locks these strands, which are called fluxons, and it locks these fluxons in place. This is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor."
"Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter, and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature. The superconductor is only half a micron thick. It is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight."
"Superconductors can be used to create strong magnetic fields. They can also be used as power cables to transfer electricity. The phenomenon is called quantum levitation and quantum locking. The technology is still in its early stages, but it could be used in the future."
"""If the monster wants you, the monster is going to get you,"" he says. ""You can't sit and have long conversations with someone who has dementia"" ""You have to do things that are familiar, that are open-ended,"" he adds. ""That's what I'm trying to do"""
"My father started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005. He needs help eating, he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is or when it is. So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on. I am learning some basic origami."
"""I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it, I'll still be able to be mobile"" ""I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease. What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me"""
"There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia, and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million. I was working on a very interesting technology at MIT, but it was going to be a very expensive technology, and also it would be patented. I wanted to develop something that we could develop very fast, that would be cheap, and that was open-source."
"Sailing robot has a front rudder and a back rudder. The boat changes shape, the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind. Protei is the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it."
"A Dutch team has developed a way to control a sailing boat with a bladder-inflated hull. The design is similar to a boat, but the hull is propelled by the wind. The team hopes to use the technology to create a new type of sailing boat."
"Open hardware is a license. It means that everybody is free to use, modify and distribute. In exchange, the people who make improvement, they share back with the community. The idea is to transform any new product into a new market. It's to replace competition by collaboration."
Protei is an international network of innovation for selling technology using this shape-shifting hull. Protei aims to use these natural forces to remediate these man-made problems. The group believes that without the environment you have nothing.
"Morton Bast: ""We hope that we can use open hardware technology to better understand and protect our oceans"" Bast: People who regularly boost four types of resilience live 10 years longer than everyone else. Bast: If you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time, if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day, you will live longer."
"Average life expectancy in U.S. and U.K. is 78.1 years. You can add 10 years of life by boosting your four types of resilience. Every hour of the day, every day of your life, all the way to your deathbed will now be 10 years later than it would have otherwise."
"""I wish I'd spent more time playing video games,"" says the author. ""I want games to be a force for good in the world,"" he says. ""It's a good thing to have a sense of humor,"" he adds. ""There's a lot of humor in this world"""
Playing games together has tremendous family benefits. Hundreds of millions of people use social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends to stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family. Just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long-term increases in happiness.
"The game designer spent three months in bed, wanting to die. The concussion didn't heal properly, and after 30 days, she was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches, nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog. ""My brain started telling me, ""Jane, you want to die,"" she says."
"""I said, ""I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game,"" he says. ""This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good"" ""Within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away"""
"""SuperBetter"" is a game designed to help people with concussions. The game has helped people with cancer and chronic pain, depression and Crohn's disease. Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS. ""If it hadn't worked for me, there's no way I would have believed it was possible,"" says the game's creator."
"The game was helping us experience what scientists call post-traumatic growth. Scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely. Instead, we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives. The top five traits of post- traumatic growth are essentially the top five regrets of the dying."
"There are four kinds of strength, or resilience, that contribute to post-traumatic growth. There are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four types of resilience. You don't need a trauma to do it. All you have to do is complete the first four SuperBetter quests."
"You can boost your physical resilience by not sitting still. Snapping your fingers exactly 50 times is worth +1 physical resilience. Counting backwards from 100 by seven is worth -1 mental resilience. You have more mental focus, more discipline, determination and willpower."
"SuperBetter is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at what people are thinking. This week, Jarrett ponders the three-to-one positive emotion ratio. Jarrett also asks people to shake someone's hand for six seconds, or send a quick thank you."
"Shaking someone's hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream, now that's the trust hormone. This will linger during the break, so take advantage of the networking opportunities. It turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes, and those microbes do us good much of the time, rather than killing us."
"We have 10 times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells. There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain. Maybe these microbes, this microbial cloud in and on us, may be responsible for health and illness differences between us."
"Michael Zasloff: My first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave. He says a family friend who happened to be the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk, and came up to him afterwards saying, they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people. He started a collaboration to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea."
The microbial community that lives in and on us helps in the development of our immune system. Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community in your body. There's a study going on to try and prevent necrotizing enterocolitis.
"""Poo tea"" has been used to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows. Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from a healthy donor, have been shown to cure C. difficile infections in some people. ""We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves,"" says Dr. David Perry."
"The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us. We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible. But we can see them through their DNA. We are them. They are us. It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us, but it might."
"CNN's John Sutter uses a flame table to visualize the physical properties of sound. Sutter also uses a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" The technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition."
"Morten Bast: I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking's lecture series. He used a computer program to make a 3D version of the lectures. Bast: ""There's more questions than answers in the laws of physics"" ""I'm going to wave through the Kinect and see what it does"""
"Jared Ficklin: I think, after 30 years, the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning. With the sound turned off, we can hear the tone and the timbre of the speech, things that you can't get out of closed Captioning. We can also see the sound visually in real time."
"Morton Bast Reviewer: Thu-Huong Ha. ""We believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car, that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers"" ""We want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided"""
"P1 is an entirely student-built electric vehicle that can drift around corners. It can get sideways like a rally car driver, always able to take the tightest curve. P1 has raced at 150 miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats. It has also navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb."
The brain of a race car driver can be monitored using electrodes. The electrodes are placed on the head of the driver to measure brain activity. The results show that the driver's brain is working in a very different way to the rest of his body.
"CNN's John Defterios takes a behind-the-scenes look at a car race. The race at Laguna Seca, California, is one of the most difficult in the world. The driver of the car has to work hard to avoid hitting a tree in the corner."
"Race car drivers are instinctive. They are things that they have simply learned to do. It requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats. This has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles. Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach, someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential?"
"Google's self-driving car was granted the first license for an autonomous vehicle in Nevada. California's considering similar legislation, and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas. Paper maps are becoming obsolete. We now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy."
"The Holy Grail, of course, is the GPS dot. Within the next few years, I predict, that this kind of hyper-precise, carrier phase-based positioning will become cheap and ubiquitous. You'll buy GPS dots in bulk, and you'll stick them on everything you own worth a few tens of dollars."
The U.S. president ordered a change in the way GPS is used. The move was to make it easier for people to find their way around the world. But the change also led to the loss of some of the world's most accurate GPS systems.
"The Wave Bubble is an open-source GPS jammer developed by Limor Fried, a graduate student at MIT. With a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you within which GPS signals can't reside. Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical devices on the Internet."
"GPS is built deeply into our systems and infrastructure, some call it ""the invisible utility"" The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple. Instead of jamming the GPS signals, you fake them. If you do it right, the device you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed."
"GPS signals are completely open. They have no encryption or authentication. They're wide open, vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack. In any GPS receiver, there's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals. If you send in a fake GPS signal, another peak pops up. The tracking points can't tell the difference."
"With more base stations, more ground stations, better receivers and better algorithms, GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on, but what part of the street it is on. At first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers, though we eventually got it packaged into a small box."
"This level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation. Within the next few years, many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot. But will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man? Or will you turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble to protect your own privacy?"
"Sculpture of a 1950s housewife in a blender is part of a series called Blend. The piece makes you implicit in the work of art, the artist says. The artist also has a self-portrait piece, in which he projects himself on top of a punch card clock."
"The artist used video mapping and video projection to create a video sculpture. The piece memorializes his friends in these jars, and they actually move around. The sculpture is called Animalia Chordata, from the Latin nomenclature for human being."
"The dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell, and it would make you a cancer victim. The theory did not make sense to me. So, I decided over the years, because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture."
"All you need is a single oncogene, says Dr. Michael Mann, who works on breast cancer. ""Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather,"" he says. ""So, the guy is telling the cat, don't you dare think outside the box"""
"Morton Bast: I'm afraid I used to be the cat. Bast: We want to make this a structure, and ask the question, how do the cells do that? Bast: You take these cells, you put them in a dish, and within three days, they look like that."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his new book, ""We Got Milk"" Sutter: ""I made a radical hypothesis. I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant, architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal"" ""I'm so glad it all worked out,"" Sutter says."
"Researchers have shown that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization. They have also shown that there's little pieces of DNA on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix. ""It's a new way of thinking about cancer, it's a hopeful way ofthinking about cancer,"" says Dr. Michael Bociurki."

"7.6 million children die every year of preventable, treatable diseases. 178 million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting. The U.N. and certain governments are busying themselves designing a new package of goals. The world's first truly global poll and consultation will take place."
"Crowdsourcing could help the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded into the Millennial Generation's Goals. If just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment, and that comment turned into a commitment, we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people around the world."
"World leaders need to decide what the world wants to do to reduce poverty, he says. The Millennium Development Goals were agreed in 2000, but have not yet been met. The world needs to work together to achieve these goals, says Mr Anderson."
"JD: If people saw the results of this smart aid, I mean, they'd be going crazy for it. I wish the 250,000 people who really did march outside this very building knew these results. Right now they don't, and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it."
"When he started to dream in color he felt that the software and his brain had united. The biggest change for him is going to an art gallery, where he can listen to Picasso paintings. The way he dresses has changed too, he says, and he now dresses in a way that sounds good."
"When I look at someone, I hear their face, so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible. The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise, and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience, so I started to paint music and paint people's voices. Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman."
"Morton Bast was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness. In 2003, he started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon, and the result, with further collaborations, is this electronic eye. Bast can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive."
I think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive. I would encourage you to become a cyborg. I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control. I think life will be much more exciting when we start creating applications for our own body.
"Piracy is a $10-billion-a-year discontinuity in the global transport system. It is also an attack on the global commons. We need to think about how to address it. Let's shift to a different kind of sea, the cyber sea. We see it in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Guinea."
"Human trafficking, in narcotics, in humans, in weapons, God forbid, is part of the threat to the global commons. Trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global Commons. Eighty to 90 percent of the world's poppy, opium and heroin, comes from Afghanistan."
"Morton Bast: We know our 20th-century tools are not going to work. Bast: I would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun. Bast says open-source security is about international, interagency, private-public connection."
"NATO has taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level. NATO is teaching them to read in literacy courses by NATO in partnership with private sector entities and development agencies.

"In a new study, participants drink a cup of tea and then solve a series of puzzles. The more puzzles they solve, the greater the chances that they'll win some prizes. In order to solve these puzzles effectively, your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously, the researchers say."
"phthalmologist Michael Schulder: ""The most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits -- these were very painful for my wife, understandably so"" ""We want these puzzles to be difficult because we want them to be challenging,"" he says of the puzzles."
"Studies show that passengers, even though the tea was picked for you at random, will end up solving more puzzles than you, the drivers. You will spend less time compared to you. You are also putting less juice into the task -- less effort, you're less persistent, and so on."
Why does this happen? And under what situations -- when -- would we see this pattern of results? It all has to do with when you face what I call the INCA. The INCA stands for the nature of the feedback you're getting after you made the decision.
"phthalmologist says he and his wife took the passenger's seat during his wife's cancer treatment. ""We let the doctors make all the decisions and take the driver's seat,"" he says. ""The good news, thank God, is that the cancer is still in remission"""
"Doctors are using the technology to protect themselves from lawsuits. The technology has applications in art, advertising and print journalism. ""It's best to be in control, it's bestto be in the driver's seat,"" says the BBC's David Walliams."
The technology allows you to see the world through someone's eyes. It can also be used to take cinema-quality 3D models and place them in the world around you. The tools to do this are free and available to everyone within the application.
Aurasma is a free app that allows users to tag objects on the Internet. The app can also be used to send postcards and Christmas cards back to family. It can be used by anyone with a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G connection.
Morton Bast Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D. The tools are pretty much identical to what we've just used to create this demonstration. The only difference is that you've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content.
"Technology crafts are emerging as a new way of making things. They can be found all over the world, and you can even buy salvaged parts. You don't have to necessarily buy brand new things. You can buy condemned computers that are stripped apart, and things that you can reassemble."
" silicon technology today is mostly about a culture of excess and fix-it-locally culture. The one-teacher school is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting. It's an informal school, but it's really about holistic education. So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry."
Teachers can use a mobile phone to access the digital world. The mobile phone can be used to load up files of different formats and play them. Teachers can also use the phone to share information with students. The technology can also be used in classrooms to help students with reading comprehension.
"A new way to send data from a camera to a computer is being trialled in India. The device uses a car battery to transmit data from the camera to the computer. The technology could be used in a variety of ways, not just for health care, says the inventor."
Vinay Venkatraman and Bruno Giussani developed the device. It measures a patient's pulse rate and the amount of oxygen in their blood. The device also directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity of the situation.
"Morton Bast talks about how a remote control can be converted into a mobile phone app. He says the app could change the way public health care works in the UK. Bast: ""It's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes when I once happened to bump into him"""
"It was a machine that was never built, and yet, it will be built. The memory is very like the memory of a computer today, except it was all made out of metal, stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high. It's a decimal machine."
"In the '30s and the '40s, simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today. Charles Babbage wanted to use proven technology, so steam and things. He prepared programs anticipating this would happen. Babbage also needed a printer and a sound system."
"The first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s. Charles Babbage was obsessed with numbers, so he designed a plotter as well. Along comes Ada Lovelace, the daughter of the mad, bad and dangerous-to-know Lord Byron."
"Babbage was building a machine to do mathematics. He said, ""Just because you're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn't mean these things can't represent other things in the real world"" This is called the Church–Turing thesis. It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical."
"The first computer was built by Charles Babbage in the early 1800s. It ran on punch cards and had just 1k of memory. A new project will build a replica of the machine in South Kensington, London. The project is called Plan 28 and is being funded by the Science Museum."
"Morton Bast: I really miss that era, you know, where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you. Babbage himself was born at the end of the 18th century, and was a fairly famous mathematician. He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge, and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking."
"All this information is stored for at least six months, up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider. Some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0. ""A mobile phone can change your life, and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom,"" he says."
"The German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional. At first he saw it, and I said, okay, it's a huge file. But then after a while I realized, this is my life. This is six months of my life, into this file."
"With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt. You can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne, and how often I call in between. All this is possible with this information. This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran."
"State agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us, online and offline. But self-determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction. All this is possible with your mobile phone. You have to fight for it every day."
"In 1989, hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change. Now, we can use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures. But rather than folding things by hand, we'll bring the structure into the computer, and code it as an algorithm."
"Computer-generated forms are free of any physical constraints. The computer can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions. 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this, but this, the geometric equivalent of noise. The forms that I showed before were made through very long trial and error."
A new way to show the shape of a building is to fold it into a column. The shape of the column can be used to show how the building is folded. The process is very simple and can be repeated many times to get the same result.
"Unlike traditional architecture, it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail. These forms are undrawable. An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months, or even a year."
"The model was made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other. It took several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves, to grow on the inside."
"The model is made of a single sheet of ABS plastic. The process is similar to that used to make a model of a tree. The idea is to use the same process to make other objects. The project is in its early stages, but the technology is improving."
"The whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond -- that's how much time it takes for light to travel. But I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion. Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research."
MIT's new femto-camera can capture one trillion frames per second. The camera is a billion times faster than the shortest exposure. The femto camera could be used to see around corners and to check if a tomato is ripe. It could also be used for still-life photography.
"Ramesh Raskar has created a femto-camera that can look at the world at the speed of light. The camera can capture multiple bounces of light, which can be used to identify hidden objects. The technique can also create slow motion videos of light in 3D. The technology could one day be used in cars to avoid collisions with objects."
Femto-photography is a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health-imaging problems. We can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows. Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders.
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at some of the most famous paintings of the 20th century. He says he tries to be selective when he looks at them. Defterio: ""I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something pulls me"""
"""I can't tell if she's happy or sad, and I change my mind all the time,"" says the artist. ""I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship,"" he adds. ""Which made me go, ""Yippee! I can do whatever I want with this painting"""
"There have been suggestions that the woman in the painting is Vermeer's 12-year-old daughter. It would have been inappropriate for the artist to paint his daughter in such an intimate way. So, how do we get her into the painting?"
"CNN's John Sutter looks at some of the most famous paintings of the 20th century. Among them is a portrait of the artist's wife. Sutter: ""It's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife"""
"""Boy Building a House of Cards"" by Chardin was painted in 18th-century France. ""It's like a Vermeer painting a bit. It's like Goldilocks's porridge,"" says CNN's John Sutter."
"""I look at the paintings on the wall and I think, somebody has decided to put them there, thinks they're good enough to be on that wall, but I don't always see it,"" she says. ""I was thinking of a story where, if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him? Not the painter, but an older version of himself"""
"Rosy is still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave her for her wedding. The author thought of beds and red cheeks, and of course, sex when she looked at him, and thought, is that what he's thinking about? He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made!"
"The painting was commissioned by a friend of the family. It is a portrait of a young boy who was born into a family of six. The artist was inspired by his father, who was also a painter, and his brother, who is a sculptor."
"It's time for me to marry and produce an heir, he says. ""That collar looks to be strangling you,"" he adds. ""We will still see each other, I insisted. We can still play cards and attend court. Nothing need change"""
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the benefits of urban beekeeping. Sutter: ""We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living"" ""What about in 100 years, and gardening, and we create our own crops?"" he asks."
"Overwintering success is hard, and that's when most of the colonies are lost. In the cities, bees are surviving better than they are in the country. The yield for urban hives is higher as well as the overwintering survival."
"Honeybees are dying, and it's a huge, huge grand challenge of our time. The varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping. With the trains coming in to urban hubs, they can carry pollen with them, very light pollen."
"In 2006, honeybees started disappearing, so suddenly, this little nerd kid working with bugs became very relevant in the world. So, what I do is honeybee research. I don't research what's killing the bees, per se. We're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines."
"Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar. You can paint a hive to match your home. In New York City, beekeeping was illegal until 2010. If you're not a flower, these bees don't care. They'll say, ""S'cuse me"""
Honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture. Researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing the declining numbers of bees. The costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price.
"Social media changed Chinese mindset. More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright. It gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to, it's like a training of their citizenship, preparing for future democracy."
"China has 500 million Internet users, the biggest population of Netizens in the whole world. But China also has a great firewall. It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas, but also to prevent China's own citizens to access the global free Internet."
"The Chinese government has blocked every single international Web 2.0 service. The government wants to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want. ""That's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship. That's not only to censor you. It's also to make sure you don't go online,"" he says."
"Tunisia's president was the first to topple during the Arab Spring. He allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service, to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia. The Chinanet can create very powerful energy, which has never happened in the Chinese history."
"Chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the Embassy's side. Part of the reason is Chinese languages. In English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link. But in Chinese language, it's really about 140 characters, means a paragraph, a story."
"Weibo is the Chinese translation for ""microblog"" It became the media platform of 300 million readers. Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life. It's a remedy outside the judicial system, because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth: The emperor is good."
"Yao Chen is the most popular microblogger in China, who has about 21 million followers. They're almost like a national TV station. So your sad stories, by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters, professors or celebrities."
"Sina Weibo was founded exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com. ""Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government, we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime,"" says Li. ""Even if you want to have some gathering, before you go there, the police are already waiting for you"""
"In the past three years, social movements about microblogging really changed local government, because they can't access the data. The Bo Xilai case recently, very big news, he's a princeling. But from February to April this year, Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors."
"""Apollo 13"" is based on footage of the launch of the Apollo 13 rocket. The film was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong, because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution. The director shot everything with short lenses, which means that you're very close to the action, but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots."
"""I'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of America's finest moments with fire extinguishers"" ""I'm just going to show you some footage. ... It changes what we see and what we remember"" ""It's what you dream about"""
"Morton Bast: ""Titanic"" was, if you don't know the story, doesn't end well. Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic. Bast: I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life."
"CNN's John Defterios tries to recreate the effect of seeing the Titanic from the perspective of a sub. Defterio: ""Once you believe something's real, you transfer everything that you feel about it, and it's totally artificial"" ""I found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use,"" he says."
"""Hugo"" is about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture. Sasha Baron Cohen wanted to do an homage to the kind of the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train."
"""It's actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys"" ""I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine, and said, ""You know, this is, you know, kind of the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on"" ""No one knows you had anything to do with it,"" he said."
"""I had to practice it as a kid, and I'm really sick of it. So what I might like to try to do is to change it, to transform it in some ways, to personalize it"" ""I can actually do all sorts of things. I can play with a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks"""
"""I'm working on a piece that's 180 pages in length, and it's just a big chunk of my life,"" he says. ""It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation. I can understand the question, ""But is it music?"" I mean, there's not any traditional notation,"" he adds."
"CNN's John Sutter shows you some of his favorite pieces. Some of the pieces feature unusual instrumentation. Sutter: ""I get it, with, like, the weird appliances and the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors, people might, you know, wonder, yeah, ""Is this music?"""
"The composer says the important question is, ""Is it interesting?"" He says he doesn't worry about the definition of the thing that he's making. ""I recorded an awesome singer, and I took the sound of his voice in my computer,"" he says."
"""I am not a farmer. And I don't like back-breaking labor. So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success into something small,"" she says. ""And lo and behold, we gave birth to the first edible wall in New York"""

"GrowNYC grows 25,000 pounds of vegetables, paying people living wage and health benefits, while feeding people for pennies on the dollar. Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity. I urge you, my fellow Americans, to help us make America great again."
"""I urge you to become a big frog and take that big, green leap"" ""We are growing our way into a new economy. I don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever. We can do something here"""
"Morton Bast: We cannot afford, as a society, to provide every student with an individual human tutor. Bast: How can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve, to the right side with the green curve? Bast: Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer."
"""The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but a wood that needs igniting,"" says Mark Twain. ""We should spend less time at universities lecturing and more time with our students,"" he says. ""It's a shame that for so many people, learning stops when we finish high school"""
"Only a little over half of recent college graduates in the U.S. who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education. This, of course, is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions. For many others, they do not get the value for their time and their effort."
The Coursera is a free online learning platform. It aims to help students learn more about the world around them. The site is based in New York City and is run by a group of academics. It was founded in 2012 by two academics who wanted to improve the quality of education for all.
"Since opening the website in February, we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries. 1.5 million enrollments, 6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched so far have been submitted. 14 million videos have been viewed."
"In South Africa, students are taught in short, modular units. This allows them to learn in a different way to other students. It is also a way to teach students how to read and understand the material. It can also be used to help students with reading comprehension and vocabulary."
"Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting, status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented deviations from rational behavior. Today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education."
"Researchers at the University of Johannesburg are using peer grading to help students learn. Students are graded on how well they do their own work, rather than how well their teachers do. Peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades, the researchers say."
"Princeton Sociology professor: ""We now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised"" ""Even if a student posed a question at 3 o'clock in the morning, somewhere around the world, there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem"""
"The data that we can collect here is unique. You can collect every click, every homework submission, every forum post from tens of thousands of students. So you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis-driven mode to the data- driven mode."
"In the aftermath of the tsunami in Japan, many people lost everything they had. The tsunami left behind thousands of photos, many of which are still in the hands of locals. Many of the photos are of people who have lost their lives in the tsunami."
"Photographers from around the world have been helping to repair damaged photos. The process can take up to a month to complete, depending on the size of the image. The photos are then uploaded to a cloud-based server to be restored."
"The photos were found by a woman whose husband had been killed in the tsunami. They had been damaged by water and had to be hand-cleaned. ""It's like doing a tattoo on someone - you don't get a chance to mess it up,"" says photographer."
"All Hands is a group of 100 people who hand-clean 135,000 photographs. The photos were taken during the tsunami in Japan in March 2011. The project has helped 90 families get their photos back. ""It's given them a connection to something bigger, using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin"""
"All Hands Volunteers were on the ground, within days, working as part of the response efforts. By a rate of two to one, the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant. Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point, a threshold."
"In the 1950s, Dr. Alice Stewart was the first person to publish a study of child cancer. The study was published in The Lancet, a journal of medical science. Dr. Stewart worked with a doctor named George Kneale, who was also a doctor."
George and Alice were very good at conflict. He actively sought disconfirmation. He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories. They saw it as thinking. It's a fantastic model of collaboration -- thinking partners who aren't echo chambers.
"Morton Bast: Organizations are too afraid of conflict. He says they can't think together and get the best out of their people. Bast: We have to see it as thinking, and then we have to get really good at it."
"The author worked with an executive at a medical device company who was worried about a new device. She says he was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help. The two worked together to find a way for him to raise his concerns, and the rest of the team agreed."
University of Delft requires PhD candidates to make five statements. The first one is about the rising incidence of childhood cancers. The second is about how to deal with the information that is out there. The third is on how to use the information to help people make better decisions.
"Vocal tremor is one of the most common forms of Parkinson's disease. To test for the condition, a doctor has to send a patient to a specialist clinic. The patient has to spend a few days in the clinic before they can be tested."
"Using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning, we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone. The voice-based tests are non-expert. They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most, and are ultra-low cost."
"Max Little: We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet. Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply, and leave recordings, a few cents each. With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming to record a very large number of voices."
Morton Bast: We need objective tools to detect Parkinson's disease before it's too late. Bast: The only way we'll know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure. He says two thirds of the melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed. Bast says we'll do some side-by-side comparisons.
"Bob Dylan has been christened the voice of a generation. American copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others. Henry Ford once said, ""I invented nothing new. I simply assembled the discoveries of other men"""
"Jeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything -- isn't completely new. Han: It's the small parts of it that are, and it's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent: to promote the progress of useful arts."
KF: Would a young and inexperienced Apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like Xerox? KF: This idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed. We have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours.
"""The Grey Album"" is new media created from old media. It was made using these three techniques: copy, transform and combine. ""It's a liberation from our misconceptions, and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves,"" he says."
"The Egyptian revolution has been marked by acts of violence and violence against protesters. Egyptian artist Ramy Essam has created a series of noes against violence. Essam's noes include no to killing, blinding heroes and burning books. He has also painted a life-size tank and a message on a wall."
"""I want to shine a light on those who are still fighting for their rights,"" says the artist. ""I want them to know that we will do whatever we can to help them,"" he says. ""We are all in this together. We are all part of the same struggle,"" he adds."
"""I hope that these images will awaken a force in those who view them, and that fire will shine a light on them,"" he says. ""There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of these many beautiful, beautiful people,"" he adds."
"Slavery generates profits of more than $13 billion worldwide each year. An entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $18. Slavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world, and yet it is illegal everywhere."
"In Kathmandu, CNN's Nina dos Santos traveled with Free the Slaves. She found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below. Some don't even know they're enslaved, people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay, she says."
"CNN's Jim Boulden visits a village in India where children are forced to work in a textile factory. The children are doused in dye and forced to wash it off with water. The men are also forced to do the same, even though they are not slaves."
"More than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta, the largest man-made lake in the world. Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished. They're forced to work endless hours on these boats, even though they do not know how to swim."
"Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery. Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold. Mercury is used in the extraction process. Many men are still deep in that hole, risking their lives without payment or compensation."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to South Africa to meet victims of violence. He met a man whose leg had been amputated after he was injured in an accident. Defterio: ""I realized that what I really needed to know was how violence works"""
"Satish: The change that has to take place must take place here, inside me. He says self-knowledge is one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power. Satish: My heroine is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, who walked forward with such calm and such clarity."
"Morton Bast: My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it. Bast: The only thing to do is to get up, make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear. Bast asks: How do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return?"
"""Wherever there is injustice there's anger. But anger is like gasoline, and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match, you've got an inferno,"" he says. ""Anger as an engine ... in an engine -- is powerful,"" he adds."
"The U.S. military has been trying to stop the spread of deadly disease in Africa. The U.N. says the use of force is not the answer to the problem. Instead, it should be working with local communities to help them fight disease."
"The British military have always been much better at this, he says. But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from. A brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel called Chris Hughes led his men down the streets of Najaf. Hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground."

""He faked it too well, and now he's stuck inBroadmoor and nobody will believe he's sane"" ""I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park,"" he says."
"When he was 17, Tony told a psychiatrist he wanted to watch women die in a car crash to make him feel normal. He was sent to a mental hospital where he was told he would be treated for his 'madness' He faked his way into the hospital by pretending to have a mental illness."
"Morton Bast met serial killer Tony Bundy at Broadmoor prison. Bundy told Bast it's harder to convince people you're sane than it is to convince them you're crazy. Bast: ""They're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state"""
"Faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath. The pinstripe suit speaks to glibness, superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth. Faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong."
" capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior, Hare says. Hare: ""I think there's a very good chance there's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room"" ""It's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all,"" he says."
"Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies, he'd close down 30 percent of the workforce. He'd quite often fire people with a joke. ""I've got parent-child relational problems, which I blame my parents for,"" Dunlap says."

"CNN's John Defterios interviewed Tony Blair at Broadmoor prison in London. Blair was accused of being a psychopath, but was released after 14 years. Defterio says the UK over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. He says the psychiatry profession has a desire to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder."
"The church had become a community gathering place overnight. The town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits. People wanting to help or needing information went to the church. But when we arrived, we found problems. There were a couple large, sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center."
"We need to get the word out about the need for help. We need to make a list of what we need and what we don't need. We don't have a lot of money, but we need to start with what we have. So we're going to need a list."
"Caitria O'Neill, a volunteer in Massachusetts, helped organize relief efforts after last year's storms. She and her fellow volunteers had to learn how to answer questions quickly and solve problems in a minute or less. ""The point is, if there's a flood or a fire or a hurricane, you, or somebody like you, are going to step up and start organizing,"" she says."
"""We need a tool that can be deployed after every disaster,"" says one of the co-founders of the group. ""We need to be able to use the tools we have to help people in need,"" he says. ""It's time-consuming, but we need to do it,"" he adds."
"FEMA and the state will pay 85 percent of the cost of a federally-declared disaster, leaving the town to pay the last 15 percent. If the town can mobilize X amount of volunteers for Y hours, the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town's contribution."
"Morgan O'Neill and his wife, Caitria, have been developing disaster relief software. The company has been flying into disaster areas to set up the software. ""It's not rocket science. These tools are obvious and people want them,"" says Morgan."
"Martha Payne: It doesn't take Harvard or MIT to fly in and fix problems after a disaster; it takes a local. Payne: If you give locals the tools, if you show them what they can do to recover, they become experts. The thing that got Martha Payne's opinions out into the public was a piece of technology."
"T.S. Eliot once said, ""One of the most momentous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of prose"" That's now the state we're in with these collaboration tools. We have them. We've seen them. They work. Can we use them?"
"The printing press was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce Catholic intellectual hegemony across Europe. Instead, what we got was Martin Luther's 95 Theses, the Protestant Reformation, and, you know, the Thirty Years' War. The more ideas there are in circulation, the more idea there are for any individual to disagree with."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the social media revolution. He says open-source programmers are trying to use the tools of the printing press for better arguments. Sutter: ""I study social media, which means, to a first approximation, I watch people argue"""
"Morton Bast: Open-source software provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere. Bast: The only programmers who can change it are people who've specifically been given permission to access it. He says Linus Torvalds, the most famous open-source programmer, decided this wasn't the way to work."
"""Git"" is a version control system that allows users to make changes to the code. The system was designed to make it easier for people to share information about changes. It's also a way for developers to test new ideas and improve their software."
"Git is a tool that supports open-source programmers' philosophical way of working. Once Git allowed for cooperation without coordination, you start to see communities form that are enormously large and complex. There are two good reasons to think that this kind of technique can be applied to democracies in general and to the law."
"GitHub is a site that lets people share and edit source code. The site is used to share information about laws and legislation. It's also a place for people to experiment with the political ramifications of a system like that, says Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: ""No democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens"""
"CNN's John Defterios says there's a problem with democracy in the U.S. He says it's not that people don't want to vote, but that they don't have the power to do so. Defterio: ""The problem is that we don't know how to get people to vote"""
Only 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeks believe that their vote matters. 89 percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap between the opinion of the policy-makers and the public. The first thing that went right was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s.
"""The government does not know better,"" says Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: ""The very idea of political community totally has changed"" He says the Internet has changed the way people make decisions. ""It's a new way of looking at the world,"" Zelizer says."
"Until the 1970s, the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality. Now we have the reverse tendency. The spread ofdemocracy now is very much accompanied with the increase in inequality. It is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand."
TED Talk: Have you seen what the digital world has done to U.S. politics these days? TED Talk: What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.TED: These days it's very popular to believe that this push for transparency can restore trust in politics.
"Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions, says Bulgarian President. Transparency is politics' management of mistrust, he says. ""It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you,"" says Bulgarian president. ""We're going to have ""1984"" in reverse,"" he adds."
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks to the Bulgarian prime minister about his government's transparency policy. He says it's a good idea to be transparent, but it's also important to be careful about what you say. Bouldens: ""There is a big shadow where there is much light"" in politics."
"Congress was debating what to call the president. Some wanted to call him ""His Highness"" Others wanted to name him ""The President of the United States of America"" The debate went on for three weeks before Congress voted on a new name."
"The Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President. The Senate did not cave in. Instead, they agreed to use the title ""President"" for now. President Obama is there on borrowed time, just waiting for the Senate to spring into action."
"""The President of the United States of America"" doesn't sound that humble, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: ""Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur"" The U.S. has more than 5,000 nuclear warheads, Sutter says."
The NeoNurture infant incubator was designed to keep a baby warm for a week. The only baby ever put inside it was this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot. The idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers to take this model and run with it.
"NeoNurture was designed to help poor families, rural doctors, overloaded nurses, even repair technicians. Michael Free at PATH says you have to figure out who will ""choose, use and pay the dues"" for a product like this."
"Jaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world. Jaundice is one of these mind-boggling global problems. In emerging markets, where the fish are, are the emerging middle class of these countries. The goal is to reduce jaundice in those countries."
"Of newborns, one in 10 roughly, if it's not treated, the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either a life-long disability, or the kids could even die. The effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity."
"We see other examples of problems like this. We have to think like existentialists: it's not the painting we would have painted, it's the painting that we actually painted. So, when we think about our partner MTTS, they've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses."
"Hospitals would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy. The goal is to make a state-of-the-art product that our partner MTTS can actually manufacture. This is the Firefly phototherapy device, except this time, we didn't stop at the concept car."
" Firefly has a single bassinet. It only fits a single baby, and the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device. If you try to put more than one kid in, you're stacking them on top of each other."
"Four million babies around the world die every year before their first birthday. Half of those kids, or about 1.8 million newborns, would make it if you could just keep them warm for the first three days, maybe the first week. ""If you really want to make a difference in the world, you have to design outcomes"""
"Morton Bast: I think, really, what I care about most is making space, and that's what I've called this talk: Making Space. I wanted to do something that was working directly with the world, directly with place. I think of this as the place of imagination, of potential, but what are its qualities?"
"The artist started by throwing a hand-sized stone as far as he was able. He then cleared all the stones within that radius and made a pile. He stood on the pile, and threw all of those rocks out again, and here is rearranged desert."
"""Learning To See"" is a lead case made around the space that my body occupied, but it's now void. It's a bit of, well, we could call it night, we can call it the 96 percent of gravity that we don't know about, dark matter, placed in space, anyway, another version of a human space."
"""Room for the Great Australian Desert"" is an object for the mind. ""Blind Light"" is perhaps the most open work, and in a conference of radical openness. ""I think maybe this is as radical as I get, using light and water vapor as my materials"""
"""Minto: Live"" represents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival,"" says curator. ""As you walk towards the ever-open threshold, you disappear, both to yourselves and to others,"" he says. ""We are not moving towards some kind of goal. We are at the goal, and it is changing with us,"" he adds."
"Modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of World War II. The old festivals continued to thrive, but from Brighton to Rio to Perth, something new was emerging. LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues. They understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere."
"Morton Bast: Festivals can show us people that we might overlook in our lives. Bast: For ""The Sultan's Elephant,"" Royal de Luxe came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend, a time-traveling elephant. Morton Bast: We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities."
"The Guardian's John Defterios writes about his experience of attending a festival in Australia. He says the festival captured the complexity and excitement of the way we live. Defterio: ""I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, and forget what really matters"""
"The wall is a public space for people to reflect on their life and share their personal aspirations in public space. Walls have been made in countries around the world, including Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina, and beyond. It's about knowing you're not alone; it's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his love of New Orleans and the city's abandoned buildings. Sutter: ""I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do"" ""I feel like every time someone sneezes, New Orleans has a parade"""
"In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves. So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers in the south China factory city called Dongguan. Certain subjects came up over and over: how much money they made, what kind of husband they hoped to marry."
"The worker in an industrial factory has no control, no pleasure or understanding in her own work. What a factory makes is never the point, and the workers could not care less who buys their products. For example, an entry-level-line worker in a Chinese iPhone plant would have to shell out two and a half months' wages for an iPhone."
"Reviewer: Morton Bast talks about the people who make the things we use every day. Morton Bast: We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make. Bast: I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters."
"CNN's John Sutter spent time with migrant workers in Dongguan, China. He says their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated, surprising and funny. Sutter: There are 150 million workers like her, one third of them women, who have left their villages."
"Leslie Cevallos: What really impressed me about the workers is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven, resourceful. What they want most is education, to learn, because most of them come from very poor backgrounds. They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade."
"China makes goods for markets all over the world, including its own, thanks to a combination of factors. China's low costs, its large and educated workforce, and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands. ""All of this is happening openly, and aboveboard,"" he says."
"1.8 billion people around the world work in the economy that is unregulated and informal. That's a huge number, and what does that mean? Well, it means if it were united in a single political system, one country, call it ""The United Street Sellers Republic"" ""Bazaaristan"" would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year."
"Morton Bast: One in seven Africans is a Nigerian, and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market in Nigeria. Bast: MTN makes most of its profits, perhaps 90 percent, from selling through System D, the informal economy. Most of the phones there are not second-hand at all."
"In one street market on Rua 25 de Março in São Paulo, Brazil, you can buy fake designer glasses. The sneaker manufacturer told me that if they find that Pumas are being pirated, or Adidas are being Pirated, they know they've done something wrong."
"Cooperative development is a way forward, says U.S. philosopher Paul Feyerabend. ""We have to recognize that there are differences in how people define things and what their facts are,"" he says. ""J.C.R. Licklider's vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions"""
Protein folding is a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess. Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making. A video game created by computer scientists illustrates the value of the approach.
"Human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable, says John Licklider. He says we can start by designing the human into the process. Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem, design the solution around what the human will do."
"Morton Bast: The imperative is not to figure out how to compute, but what to compute. Bast: How do you impose human intuition on data at this scale? Bast: While computers can learn to detect and identify fraud, they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen."
"Computer scientists have been able to comb through huge amounts of data to find clues. The key to great results here is the right type of cooperation, says Kasparov. Even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop, he says."
"Researchers lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper, to explore non-obvious hypotheses. 20 percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya, 50 percent of those from a single town in Libya. The researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting foreign fighters."
"Computer scientists at the University of California, San Diego, have created the world's first machine-to-machine artificial intelligence test. The test was based on Marvin Minsky's ""Licklider"" vision for artificial intelligence 50 years ago. The computer was able to solve a task that would have taken 40 people three months to complete in 40 hours."
"In the sorts of countries I work in, that so-called treatment gap approaches an astonishing 90 percent. Even in the best-resourced countries, for example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent of affected people don't receive these interventions. The great shortage of mental health professionals, such as psychiatrists and psychologists, particularly in the developing world."
"Morton: We need to unpack complex health care interventions into smaller components. He says there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care over the past decade. ""What SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is attractive,"" he says."
"Task shifting is the ultimate example of the democratization of medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power. It empowers ordinary people to be more effective in caring for the health of others in their community. The Movement for Global Mental Health was founded to advocate for the rights of people with mental illness to receive the care that we know can transform their lives."
"""We must open up our institutions, and like the leaf, we must let the nutrients flow"" ""There was no legal precedent, no technical way of doing this. In fact, many people told us it was illegal"" ""We have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal, perhaps a little too much"""
"David Frum: We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks. He says we have this opportunity to redesign institutions that are actually quite recent. Frum says private communities, private, corporate, privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies."
Twitter is opening up its platform to allow new applications to be built on top of it. The social network is also creating new ways of delivering services to the public. The U.S. government is also using Twitter to connect with the public in new ways.
"In the 1990s, the U.S. government didn't even have a Twitter account. Now, the government is using the social network to create new jobs and improve the economy. The U.K. government is also using social media to create jobs in the public sector."
The U.S. Patent Office will be open for citizen participation in patent applications. The first phase of the open government revolution is in getting better information into the hands of the public. The second phase is to get decision-making power out of the bureaucracy.
"When we start to see power over the core functions of government — spending, legislation, decision-making — then we're well on our way to an open government revolution. The important thing is to create lots more -- create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities."
"Cities will account for 90 percent of population growth, 80 percent of global CO2, 75 percent of energy use. In China alone, 300 million people will move to the city over the next 15 years. The office building is basically obsolete for doing private work."
Cities that evolved before the cars have a much smaller population. Most of what people need in a city can be within a five- or 10-minute walk. Cities that evolved after the automobile have a smaller population and a more dispersed structure.
"We think of it as a compact urban cell. We provide most of what most people want within that 20-minute walk. This can also be a resilient electrical microgrid, community heating, power, communication networks. You can dial up the density -- about 20,000 people per cell if it's Cambridge."
"Morton Bast: We need an ecosystem of shared-use vehicles connected to mass transit. Bast: The Big Dig created a traffic island, and it's certainly not a mobility pathway for anything other than cars. The Media Lab is developing a city car optimized for shared use in cities."
"We moved everything to the wheels, so you have the drive motor, the steering motor and the breaking -- all in the wheel. We can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like 28 times the land utilization with that kind of strategy. So the headlights are eyeballs, the pupils can dilate, we have directional audio, we can throw sound directly at people."
"Vehicle would operate on bike lanes, accessible to elderly and disabled, women in skirts, businesspeople. It's an electronic bike. You have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane, but if you're an older person, that's a switch. You can dial in 40 calories going into work and 500 going home."
We need a way to centralize the power of a large number of robots. We need to be able to use them in a way that they can be used to power a large part of the world. We want to make it possible to use robots to power large parts of the globe.
"It's about 70,000 dollars per space to build a conventional parking spot inside a building. If you can have folding and autonomy, you can do that in one-seventh of the space. There's a path to market for innovative companies to bring technology into the home."
We don't really believe in cameras to do things in homes. We think these little wireless sensors are more effective. We need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration. We've looked at articulating mirrors of the facade that can throw shafts of sunlight anywhere into the space.
Cities are all about people. They're places for people. There's no reason why we can't dramatically improve the livability and creativity of cities like they've done in Melbourne with the laneways. It's a global imperative. We have to get this right.
"There's a long history of antipathy between science and the law in U.S. jurisprudence, he says. One suggestion is that all of us become much more attuned to the necessity, through policy, through procedures, to get more science in the courtroom, he adds."
"Carrillo was sentenced to life imprisonment, and transported to Folsom Prison. No gun was ever found. No vehicle was ever identified as being the one in which the shooter had extended his arm. No person was ever charged with being the driver of the shooter's vehicle."
"CNN's John Defterios reconstructs the night of the shooting. He says the shooting happened in the middle of the night, when there was no moonlight. Defterio: ""It's a tragedy that happened, but it's not a tragedy we can't fix"""
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at the damage caused by a car crash. He says the damage was caused by the collision between a car and a truck. Defterius: ""It's a very, very sad thing to see. It's a real shame"""
"The New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory can generate thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array, essentially avatars of ourselves. The judge was totally stoic during the reenactment. The day after the shooting, they showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said, ""That's the picture. That's the shooter"""
"Stem cells are our body's own repair kits, and they're pluripotent. They are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery. Soon, we actually will be able to use stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased."
"Stem cell research could lead to new treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes, says Dr. Morton Bast. Bast: ""It's a terrible social model because of what's involved and the cost to all of us"" To bring a successful drug to market, it takes, on average, 13 years, Bast says."
"Stem cell research has been under siege politically and financially, she says. The field has brought us to the threshold of personalized medicine, she adds. ""It's like having an app without having a smartphone,"" she says of robotic technology."
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area. It's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species. MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence. The decline in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning.
"Morton Bast: In my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan. We give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people, their minds, their mental states, their emotions. Bast: One of the findings that we've found several times now is that part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex is more active in adolescents."
The ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence. There's an important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence. The very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave.
"The limbic system is involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things, including taking risks. The prefrontal cortex, which stops us taking risks, is still very much in development in adolescents."
Noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years. Sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery. There are just huge benefits to come from designing for the ears in our health care. This is an area I intend to take on this year.
"In a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds, this is what it sounds like. If you take that down to 0.4 seconds by installing acoustic treatments, sound absorbing materials and so forth, you get what you get. In language, infinitely many words can be written with a small set of letters. In arithmetic, infinitelyMany numbers can be composed from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero."
"The average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels. That is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction. In the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population. The cost to treat a classroom down to that 0.4-second reverberation time is two and a half thousand pounds."
"The World Health Organization estimates that a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities. The benefits of designing for the ears in education are 'unbelievable', says professor. noise in offices has been shown to make people less helpful and less productive at work."
"Invisible architecture is about designing spaces that sound as good as they look. The sound around us is affecting us even though we're not conscious of it. Communication requires sending and receiving, but I can send as well as I like, and you can be brilliant conscious listeners."
A new study shows how much food is being wasted in the world. It shows that most countries have more than they need to feed their population. The world's population is growing at a faster rate than the amount of food it needs to feed it.
"Morton: ""We have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger"" ""But we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear,"" he says. ""We need to start thinking about what we can do with the food we already have"""
"Food waste is a huge problem across the world, says the author of a new book. Food waste can be seen on every street corner in Britain, Europe and North America, he says. But the real waste is up the food supply chain, in supermarkets, greengrocers and farms."
"Liver, lungs, heads, tails, kidneys, testicles, all of these things which are traditional, delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste. Offal consumption has halved in Britain and America in the last 30 years. 40 to 60 percent of European fish are discarded at sea."
"""We throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them"" ""If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save that amount of carbon"" ""It's also a massive saving of resources. We knew that during the war"""
"Freeganism is a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food. The best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it, and to stop wasting it. We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the trauma of fighting for his life. Sutter: ""It's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things at the same time, it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck"" ""I think to myself, ""No, this is going to lead to other things"""
"Since 1996, over five million people have died in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Countless women, men and children have been raped, tortured or enslaved. Rape is used as a weapon of war, instilling fear and depopulating whole areas. It is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts."
"The Congo consistently scores dreadfully in global health and poverty rankings. But remarkably, the UN Environmental Programme has estimated the wealth of the country to be over 24 trillion dollars. The state-regulated mining industry has collapsed, and control over mines has splintered. Coltan is easily controlled by armed groups."
"TED speaker: It is time to be asking questions about technology. At the moment, there is no clear fair-trade solution. The US has recently passed legislation to target bribery and misconduct in the Congo. There are campaigns spreading across university campuses to make their colleges conflict-free."
"Communication was extremely difficult in the Congo. Even if he could have afforded the phone bills home, most people did not own a phone line. Today, my two sons can talk to my parents and get to know them. It is time to demand fair-trade phones."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a documentary about hackers. He says the project has been a huge success and he hopes it will inspire others. Defterio: ""I think we're going to see a lot more of this kind of thing in the future"""
"By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day. We reverse engineer lab equipment. We genetically engineer bacteria. We hack hardware, software, wetware, and, of course, the code of life."
"DNA has the power, potentially, to replace our fossil fuels, to revolutionize medicine, and to touch every aspect of our daily lives. It's a great time to be a molecular biologist. Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper."
"DNA barcoding can be used to check if your caviar is really beluga, if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat's. You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere, collect microbes, see what's up there."
" DIYbio advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone, not just scientists and people in government labs. The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate, it could really stimulate innovation. The thing is, there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else."
"When she was a student at Harvard, social scientist Laura Stepp was told she was ""not supposed to be here"" Stepp: ""You're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do"" and do it, even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience. Stepp says the moment she realized she could do it was when she realized, ""Oh my gosh, I have become this"""
"""Fake it till you become it"" is the key to coping with stress. ""Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes,"" says the author. ""Don't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am"""
"Social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language, or other people's body language. And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date. The people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources."
"Jessica Tracy is a social psychologist and teaches at a competitive business school. She became interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance. Tracy: We are influenced by our nonverbals, our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology. She shows that people with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition."
MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals. We tend to make ourselves smaller if someone is being really powerful with us. It seems to be related to gender. It's what happens when you put together high and low power.
"Morton Bast: Women feel chronically less powerful than men, so this is not surprising. Bast: But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating, and how well they were participating. Bast offers a free no-tech life hack: Change your posture for two minutes."
"Powerful people tend to be more assertive and more confident, more optimistic. Physiologically, there also are differences on two key hormones: testosterone and cortisol. High-power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol."
"In primate hierarchies, if an alpha needs to take over, within a few days, that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly. We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment, and these people adopted, for two minutes, either high-power or low-power poses."
"In the experiment, participants spit into a vial, for two minutes, and then we ask them, ""How powerful do you feel?"" on a series of items. High-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease in testosterone, and low- power people experience a 15-percent increase. ""We want them to be feeling power"""
"Power posing can change your life in meaningful ways, researchers say. It's not just others, but it's also ourselves, they say. The best place to use it is in evaluative situations, such as a job interview. The research was published in the journal Psychological Bulletin."
Researchers tested the effect of high- or low-power poses on people in a stressful job interview. The results showed that high-power posers were more likely to be hired. The effect was seen when people were judged by judges who were trained to give no nonverbal feedback.
"Cuddy: ""When I tell people about this, that our bodies change our minds and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me, ""It feels fake"" ""I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here,"" she says."

"NAND2Tetris became one of the first massive, open, online courses. Students gradually build a chip set, a hardware platform, an assembler, a virtual machine. Students use JACK to write all sorts of cool games like Pong, Snake and Tetris."
"NAND2Tetris is an open-source computer game that challenges users to test their knowledge of computer science. The game has become a popular way for people to learn about computer science and technology. The course is free and available online, and is open to anyone."
"""We went too far with this nonsense, and grading became degrading,"" says Salman Rushdie. ""We don't replace teachers, by the way.

"When I realized how slow a computer was compared to how fast a computer is, it made me wonder about computers and technology in general. I've been curious about technology, design and art, and how they intersect, how they overlap, and also a topic that I've taken on since four years ago I became the President of Rhode Island School of Design: leadership.

"The artist's father, a new media artist, realized art isn't about old or new, it's about something in between. ""Art makes questions, and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions,"" he says. ""A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at,"" he adds."
"The artist says leaders are faced with how to lead differently. He says a traditional leader is always wanting to be right, whereas a creative leader hopes to beright. The artist says artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe."
"Leadership, connecting people, is the great question today. Leaders connect improbable connections and hope something will happen. Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy. The CEO isn't ever at the top of the organization, the CEO's at the center."
"Sebastian Sebastian: ""I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design"" Sebastian: People are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built. Sebastian: Having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power."
Sebastian is a 50-year-old Airbnb host in Paris. He says he's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life. He believes we are at the start of a collaborative revolution that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.
"Sally Kohn: The real magic of marketplaces like Airbnb is using the power of technology to build trust between strangers. She says it's about empowering people to make meaningful connections, enabling us to rediscover a humanness. Kohn says the key reason why it's taking off now is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of sharing."
"TaskRabbit is a marketplace fueled by reputation. People outsource the tasks that they want doing, name the price they're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits bid to run the errand. There's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process that's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants."
Sally Kohn: We're entering the third trust wave: connecting strangers online. Kohn says TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids. She asks: How do we ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities?
"With every trade we make, comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn, we leave a reputation trail. Five million nights have been booked on Airbnb in the past six months alone. This year, two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms."
"The next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score. The future's going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation, not a single algorithm. It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform a Facebook- or Google-like search and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors."
"Reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century. A three-digit score, your traditional credit history, will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost, what we can access. Reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me."
"Neurobiologists are using human beings to study and model the software in human beings. ""We're now beginning to understand and identify brain systems involved in valuation,"" he says. ""That's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up to a new experimental preparation"""
"We have a behavioral superpower in our brain, and it at least in part involves dopamine. We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea, for a mere idea. No other species can do that. These same valuation systems are redeployed when we're valuing interactions with other people."
Morton Bast: How can we arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe? Bast: And the short answer is games. Bast: What we do is we go into two areas. One is experimental economics. The other is behavioral economics. And we steal their games.
Researchers have been able to exploit human social interaction in a way that can be used to study biological processes. The research has been carried out on thousands of people around the world. The researchers say they are so good at this that they don't even notice the human side of the process.
"Scientists have developed software that can link brain imaging devices over the Internet. This means they can eavesdrop safely on healthy brain activity. They can also put people with classically defined mental illnesses, or brain damage, into these social interactions, and use these as probes."
"""We ain't seen nothing yet when it comes to technology's impact on the labor force,"" he says. ""We're not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people"" ""So this is the first sort of step into using that insight into what makes us human beings, turning it into a tool"""
"In the past, if you wanted something written, a report or an article, you had to involve a person. Now we have multi-language, instantaneous, automatic translation services available for free. Digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work, they're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well."
"Morton Bast: The question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting people's ability to earn a living. Bast: In the short term, we can stimulate job growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and by investing in infrastructure. But in the not-too-long-term, we're going to transition into an economy that is very productive, he says."
"There is no single answer to the question of what caused the Great Depression. The answer is that it was a series of events that led to the Depression. It was not a single event that caused the Depression, but a set of events which led to it."

"The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology. The work of innovation is becoming more open, more inclusive, more transparent and more merit-based. Business investment in gear -- in equipment and hardware and software -- is at an all-time high."
"Computer scientists' jobs are under threat, but that's not the point, says John Defterios. He says new technology will allow them to focus on other things, like reducing poverty and drudgery around the world. Defterio: ""I am extremely confident that what we're going to do with our new digital tools"""
"In 1980, researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide, a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms. The drug was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was never published. Over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs."
"Morton Bast: I thought reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant. Bast: But it turned out that I was misled. He says the phenomenon of publication bias has been very well studied. Bast says we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine, and in this environment, it costs lives."
"About half of all trials, on average, go missing in action, and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings. If I conducted one study and I withheld half of the data points from that one study, you would rightly accuse me, essentially, of research fraud. But if somebody conducts 10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want, we don't consider that to be research misconduct."
"The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors says it will not publish any trials unless they are registered. The ICMJE says only one in five trials conducted since 2008 have been registered. ""This is a disaster. We cannot know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information,"" says the editor."

Sutter: ""When you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw, you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud"" ""We should know, I think, we should know where our Internet comes from,"" Sutter says."
"CNN's John Sutter watched a video of Gabby Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from a gunshot wound. He says the video reminded him of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, a neuroscientist studying music and the brain. Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic could still sing the lyrics to a song."
"Paul Farmer studied violin at Juilliard and auditioned for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Farmer met Nathaniel Ayers, who suffered from schizophrenia and lived on Skid Row. Ayers' story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy. Farmer started a group of musicians called Street Symphony to perform for the homeless and mentally ill."

"In an age when the visual image of any kind was rare, tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda. The exhibition was designed to be an experience, and tapestrie are hard to reproduce in photographs. The show brought it alive to them."
"The curator of the McQueen exhibition at the British Museum says he believes passionately in the power of a curated museum experience. The McQueen show was ""quite transcendant, and it became a phenomenon in its own right,"" he says. The curator also believes that collections, individual objects can also have that same power."
"The Met was set up not as a museum of American art, but of an encyclopedic museum. It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations, the cultures, that we're seeing the current manifestation of the world."

"Human brain creates a virtual map of the world that only exists in your brain. All animal species do it, even though we all use slightly different tools. We move along linear routes, and ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make. We'll go back and show you how we made it."
We attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those lines. We move along linear routes and our mind straightens streets and perceives turns as 90-degree angles. So we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning. We recognize them by the experiences and we abstract them into symbols. We're all capable of understanding these symbols.
"In the 1930s, Harry Beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design to public transport maps. The key to the success of this map is in the omission of less important information and in the extreme simplification. If you were to look at the actual locations of these stations, you'd see they're very different."
"Dublin's public transport system grew with the city. For every outskirt that was added, there was another bus route added. There were never actually any lines that showed the routes in the city center. There are actually not even any stations with names."
Dublin's public transport system has been overhauled in the last five years. The city's transport network has been simplified to make it easier to visualize. The new map shows how the city's bus routes have changed over the years. It also shows how busy the city center has become in recent years.
"The map was created to show how Dublin's rapid transport links work. It was created in the style of the ""metro map"" that was so successful in London. The map shows each and every station, as well as side streets and bus routes."
"The map is relatively small in overall size, so something that you could still hold as a fold-out map or display in a reasonably-sized display box on a bus shelter. It tries to be the best balance between actual representation and simplification -- the language of way-finding in our brain."
"In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge. The devastated church my mom attends has been rebuilt higher, poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country. Satellite and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas."
"In 2005, the world watched as New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina. In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0 percent of the population, depends on rainfall for its survival. In Washington, D.C., last year, they're funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags."
"Sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems, agriculture, even major cities. Infrastructure is going to be affected. Airports around the world are located on the coast. The Asian Cities Climate [Change] Resilience Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves."
"In New York, San Francisco and London, designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind. New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms, as you can see from this clever sign, and to sea level rise."
"In 2008, Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in Myanmar. In New Orleans, the elderly and female-headed households were among the most vulnerable. One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness. The changes in these times won't affect us all equally."
"The brain is filled with 100 billion neurons just zizzing away, electrically transmitting information.

"CNN's John Defterios takes a look at some of the issues facing the world today. He asks: ""What if, actually, engagement on poverty and injustice is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do?"" ""What happens if that bomb went off because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place to deal with these things and interaction?"""
"Bruno Giussani: The brand has an Achilles' heel. It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin. The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency. They're the people who buy into the brand, support them, facilitate them."
"We are at war with a new form of terrorism. We've got to reveal the dangers in the product. The other thing to do is to knock the product, attack the brand myth, as we've said. It's not just the marketeers of terrorism, but it's the consumers of terrorism too."
"""We've got to practice what we preach,"" says David Cameron. ""We most certainly do talk to terrorists, no question about it,"" he adds. ""I feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist, sort of a health and safety terrorist"""

"The fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense, he says. We need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons in this war on terrorism. But of course, it's ideas -- not something that governments do very well."
"9/11 launched the lawfare movement in Northern Ireland. The first civil action was brought in 1998 after the Omagh Bombing. The lawfare campaign has been dubbed ""lawfare,"" for want of a better word. It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void. It also meant the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in."
"Terrorists have actually adapted to it. Terrorists were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down. The bombs actually stopped -- fact -- because of this action. New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims, and started taking it -- so it started a whole new dialogue there."
Phenomenon of terrorism is not just a pure military perception of it. We need to foster more modern and asymmetrical responses to it. The advantages of dialogue are obvious. It self-educates both sides and reveals the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.
Evolution has given us an answer to the problem of uncertainty. It's play. Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated. The only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space. It enables us to address even the most difficult of questions.
"Scientists say science is not defined by the method section of a paper. Instead, it is a way of being, and experiments are play, says Professor Blanco. The aim of the study was to not just get kids to see science differently, but to see themselves differently."
"Amy O'Toole is one of the youngest published scientists in the world. She is the personification of courage, because she's going to stand up here and talk to you all. The Blackawton Bees Project asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way."

Microsoft's Kinect lets users control their own video game console. The company says the move will save money and improve quality of life. The move is part of a larger trend of giving people more control over their own lives. The idea is to give people control over what they do.
"Companies can make their employees feel less pressed for time by making them help others. Companies can give their employees and customers more control or less. They can worry about how much openness is good for them, and what needs to stay closed. Or they can simply smile, and remain open to all possibilities."
"Companies are losing control of their customers and their employees, says Morton Bast. But are they really? Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now, 24/7, he says. Bast: Companies can give employees and customers more control."

"Official statistics indicate a little bit above 30 percent. The leading point of view is that national borders really don't matter very much anymore. So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book, ""World 3.0,"" that we're very far from the no-border effect benchmark."
Morton Bast: There's a real dearth of data in the debate. Bast: People have this tendency towards overestimation. He says it's important to spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney. Bast says the view is held by pro-globalizers like Tom Friedman.
"Facebook is the ideal kind of technology to think about. Theoretically, it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door. The answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent. The technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships."
"Morton Bast: Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization. Bast: Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people, is about the most home-biased thing you can find."

"Ten years ago, the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary, says Morton Bast. Since then, what's happened is the creation of democratic systems of government which haven't had any of those side benefits, he says. Bast: In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections, presidential and parliamentary."
"In Afghanistan, in even the most remote community, anybody who does not want a say in who governs them. The point about democracy is not instrumental. It's not about the things that it brings. Democracy is not simply a question of structures. It is an activity. And part of that activity is honesty."

"Morton Bast: Disgust is an emotion that is very easy to elicit. He says it keeps us away from things that might poison us, or make us sick. Bast: ""It's not only old-timey British scientists who are this squeamish"""
"When one disgusting thing touches a clean thing, that clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around. This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an individual or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided."
"Psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom found that people who reported that they were easily disgusted were more politically conservative. People who are very liberal are very hard to disgust, Inbar says. In a recent follow-up study, nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents were asked the same questions."
"When people are feeling disgust, their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum, toward more moral conservatism as well. Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked, including African-Americans, the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men."
"The emotion of disgust now influences our moral beliefs and even our deeply held political intuitions. The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex. The human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing."

Bihar represents the challenge of development: abject poverty surrounded by corruption. The first key shift is open knowledge. The second is open governance. The third is an open exchange of information. The fourth is the opening up of the economy.
"The World Bank has now GeoMapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries. Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability. The Arab Spring is using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability."
"In the Philippines today, parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website, Checkmyschool.org. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations. These examples give new hope, new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar."
"Every 20 minutes, one new person is diagnosed with autism. There is no known cause or cure. The World Bank is embracing these new directions, a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago. We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions."

"Across Europe and Central Asia, approximately one million children live in large residential institutions, usually known as orphanages. In a room of 40 newborns, not one of them was crying. The children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30. At 8, their nappies must be changed, so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children."
"Ceausescu's institution is one of hundreds across 18 countries, from the Czech Republic to Sudan. Most of these children will never leave the institution again. Lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors like hand-flapping, rocking back and forth, or aggression."
"Every child has the right to a family, and children are amazingly resilient. We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families, they recover their developmental delays. It's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions."
"During the first three years of life, the brain grows to its full size, with most of that growth taking place in the first six months. The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols, and have been interpreted in many different ways. There are 13 cards in each suit. Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles."

"Every single beach, every single place you look at sand, it's different. There are no two grains of sand alike in the world. Outer space is filled with sand, and that sand comes together to make our planets and the Moon."
"The Moon has been bombarded by micrometeorites for four billion years. The Moon has no atmosphere, so micromets come in continuously. Most of the sand on the Moon, especially, is lava flows, similar to basaltic lava flows."
"Morton Bast: Bats use sound to perceive their environment. Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times: once in bats, once in the birds, and once in pterodactyls. Bats emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose."
"In Western culture, bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events. They are the perpetrators in horror movies, such as this famous ""Nightwing"" Bats have a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception. If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems, they simply will not work."
"In China, bats are considered to bring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity. Bats are threatened in the U.S. by a disease known as white-nose syndrome. They are also threatened by their attraction to wind farms."
"Inside every cell in your body lies your genome. Every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different. One of the grand challenges in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases, or does this variation just make you different."
"Scientists have been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses. One in every 1,000 newborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80, over half of us will also have a hearing problem. So bats are also important for our health, to enable us to better understand how our genome functions. The secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome."
"In Europe alone, by 2050, there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65, and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80. As we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration causes problems for our society. So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome?"
"There are 19 species of mammal that live longer than man. They must have something within their DNA that ables them to deal with the stresses of flight. ""Bats as we know them have been around on this planet for about 64 million years. They're good for our ecosystem"""

"Aristotle called happiness ""the chief good,"" the end towards which all other things aim. We have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present. Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment."
"People are less happy when they're mind-wandering no matter what they're doing, according to a new study. When our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things, and they are enormously less happy. Even when people are thinking about something neutral, they're still considerably less happy than when they aren't."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the link between mind-wandering and unhappiness. Sutter: ""The cause has to come before the effect"" People's minds wander at least 30 percent of the time, Sutter says. ""It pervades basically everything that we do,"" he says."
"The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically, we haven't actually gotten any happier. People have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years. In the last few years, there's been an explosion in research on happiness."
"Tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that. After Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly, now moving forward, we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response."
"Morton Bast: Veterans are very, very good at disaster response. He says veterans are struggling to reintegrate into civilian life. Bast: ""Right now somebody needs to step up, and this generation has the opportunity to do that"""
"""We can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home,"" he says. ""Anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics,"" he adds. ""And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics"""
"There are 10,000 species of birds in the world. 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction. Vultures are our natural garbage collectors. They clean up carcasses right to the bone. They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread."
"Kenya has eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya, of which six are highly threatened with extinction. Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds. They are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac."
"Morton Bast: I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals. When you walk out of this room, you will be informed about vultures. Bast: They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies."
"Morton Bast came up with a way for the world not to bathe. One sachet of DryBath substitutes one bath for five rand. Bast: ""DryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's saving"""

"The Butler, the Sock Puppet and the Chinese Water Army are all new types of lies. The way we communicate has been completely transformed since 1995. ""We email, we text, we skype, we Facebook. It's insane,"" says CNN's John Sutter."
"The Sock Puppet isn't about ambiguity, per se. It's about identity. Walt Whitman also did this back in the day, before there was Internet technology. The Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people in China that are paid small amounts of money to produce content."
"Research shows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested. Email is the most honest of those three media. The phone, in contrast, is the device that people lie on the most. A study in which people apply for a job involves the same information as a résumé."
"Researchers found that LinkedIn résumés were more honest on the things that mattered to employers. Researchers also found that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality. Researchers measured people, online daters, into the lab, and then we measured them."
"CNN's John Sutter: We're really bad at detecting deception, really bad. Sutter says research over the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue to deception. He says Pinocchio's nose may have something to do with it. Satter: Online communication is more honest than face to face."
"Linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not. Just because people can't see us doesn't mean we're going to necessarily lie. We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else's gain."
"In the very near future, everything we do will be recorded. In this room, right now, we've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre-ancient history. We're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear."
"Computer scientists have created an algorithm that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception. The algorithm is much more accurate than humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time. Every lie now, every type of lie -- fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews, your girlfriend cheating on you -- those are all different lies."
"Raku is a kind of pottery that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.

The Leveraged Freedom Chair is a wheelchair with levers that can be used to shift from low to high gear. The chair is designed to be small and maneuverable enough to use inside. It was developed by a paralyzed man who uses the chair to traverse rough terrain.
"The Leveraged Freedom Chair is made of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world. The chair is about 80 percent faster going on rough terrain than a normal wheelchair. It's also about 40 percent more efficient than a regular wheelchair, the designers say. The design is based on rigorous engineering science and analysis."

There's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you. I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab. What we do in the lab is actually measure what is the impact of video games on the brain.
"Researchers are developing games for patients with low vision. The aim is to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better. Video games don't lead to attention problems or distractability, the researchers say. The games can also improve our ability to track objects around in the world."
"The average age of a gamer is 33 years old, not eight years old. The average young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention. When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation? Was it yellow initially or blue?"
"Stanford University study shows multitasking is bad for the brain. People that play a lot of action games are really, really good at switching from one task to another. But not all media are created equal, and action games have a different effect on your brain."
"Video games have an amazing impact on our everyday life, says Dr. Richard Quest. Quest: ""We need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain"" Video games have ingredients that are powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention, vision, etc."
Brain scientists are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects. There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist. There are brain scientists like me that are starting to understand the broccoli side of the equation.
"Swedish city of Stockholm has lots of water and lots of bridges -- narrow bridges, old bridges -- which means lots of road congestion. Someone came up with the idea of charging drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks. One or two euro was enough to make 20 percent of cars disappear from rush hours."
" congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm on January 3, 2006. The first day with the congestion charges looked like this. It's now six and a half years ago since the congestion Charges were introduced, and we basically have the same low traffic levels still."
"When congestion pricing were introduced in the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it. The first day they all came back, the effect hanged on. Now, 70 percent of the population in Stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free."
"More than half of those surveyed believe they have liked congestion pricing all along. ""This is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems,"" says Bast. ""If you do it right, people will actually embrace the change,"" he adds."
"Vladimir Kuznetsov broke his arm, collarbone and head in the fall of 1989. He says his physical capabilities have changed dramatically, but who he is is unchanged. ""I know that I'm not my body. And I also know that you're not yours,"" he says."
"I was having a really bad day. For over 10 days, I drifted between two dimensions. I had an awareness of being in my body, but also being out of my body. I was watching from above, as if it was happening to someone else. It's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart."
"Doctors had to cut the man in half to save his life. The operation left him paralyzed from the waist down. After 10 days, he made the decision to return to his body. ""That's what defined me. That was my bliss,"" he says."
CNN's John Defterios is recovering from a spinal injury. He was in a hospital in Sydney when he was told he would never walk again. He is now recovering in hospital and hopes to make a full recovery. He says he has learned to live with the pain of his injuries.
"Janine Bast was paralyzed in a car crash in 2010. She is now writing a book about her experience in hospital. Bast: ""There were moments of incredible depth and richness, of authenticity and connection"" ""I felt so incredibly grateful for my life,"" she says."
Janine was a quadriplegic after a car accident left her with no feeling from the waist down. She was moved to a wheelchair in the hospital's spinal ward. Janine says she became depressed and wanted to give up. She says she wanted her old life back.

"Morton Bast: The Mujahideen were celebrated in this country, in America. We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists. But within that group, a tiny, smaller group, were coming up with a new and dangerous conception of jihad."
"Jihad is a struggle against vice, sin, lust and greed, writes Frida Ghitis. The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling, she says. The wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous."
"There is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. But they're not fighting a global jihad. More often than not, it's a power struggle in one country. They are the ones who tried to send the bomber to the U.S."
"The Taliban took control of a portion of southern Yemen last year. The Yemeni military got its act together and drove them out. Since then, most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis. Local jihad, if you ignore it, becomes global jihad again, he says."
"9/11 didn't empower him; it doomed him. Al Jazeera did, Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic. The Arab Spring did, because it showed a way for young Muslims to bring about change. The American military did, the American soldiers did, with their allies."
"The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited. Satellite television and the Internet are informing and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways. We don't need to persuade them, but we do need to help them."
"In prison, prisoners learn how to make do with less. Many of them want to take this ingenuity to the outside and start restaurants, barber shops, personal training businesses. The riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be."
"Morton Bast: Two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years. Bast: There's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises."
"Poet and spoken-word artist John Green says he's always wanted to transcend poetry to the world. He says he found the answer in principles in a master spoken- word artist named Reg E. Gaines. Green: ""I'm an extension of my work, and if they love me, then they will love my work"""

"Scientists are developing a bioreactor to help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way. The goal is to make a model of your heart, your brain on a chip. Some people think that these models sound well and good, but ask, ""Well, are these as good as the rat?"""
"Tissue engineering can help us develop more personalized treatments. The field is evolving towards a model of the entire ecosystem of the body, complete with multiple organ systems. One day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body."
Tissue engineering could help develop new treatments for HIV and AIDS. Human tissue could be used as models for drug testing. Human tissues could also be used to test new drugs. The first human-to-human test of a new drug will take place in a few weeks.
"Eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs. Treatment programs became possible, funding became available, and the number of people on antireTroviral Drugs started to increase very rapidly. The Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century, had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly."
"New drugs are developed, new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries. The practice of patent-holding companies have changed. So unless we act, unless we do something today, we will soon be faced [with] what some have termed the treatment time bomb."
"The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism. It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others to use. In August of this year, the U.S. drug agency approved a new four-in-one AIDS medication."
"Gilead has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool. The rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries. The pool is already working today, two months later, with generic manufacturers."
"Morton Bast: This is poo, and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you. I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo. So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld. Its head is down. It's walking backwards."
Researchers used a polarization filter to see what the beetles were looking at when they climbed on top of a ball. They found that the sun is a very important cue in the sky for the beetles. They then moved the sun with a mirror to a completely different position. The beetles then did a double dance and went back in the same direction they came from.
"The beetles are looking at celestial cues in the sky, some of which you and I can't see. The dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorient themselves. The beetle knows exactly where he's going. He knows exactly what the problem is, and he knows how to deal with it."
"Dung beetles eat dung, and their larvae are also dung-feeders. When the ground is very hot, they dance more often, and when they do this particular dance, they wipe the bottom of their face. Researchers thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to get off the hot soil."
The Pachysoma dung beetle has a unique thermal behavior. The beetle climbs on top of a ball of dung and wipes its face. This is called stilting. The beetles climb onto the ball far less often when they have boots on.
"Within South Africa, we've got about 800 species of dung beetles, and in Africa we have 2,000 species. In the world, there are about 6,000 dung beetle species. This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior."
"The dung beetle uses a technique called path integration to find its home. If it is displace it, the beetle will end up in the wrong place. The beetle then uses landmark orientation to try and find its burrow. But it fails to recognise the landmarks around it and ends up completely lost."
"CNN's John Defterios is in Lebanon to talk about the Arab Spring. He says the Middle East is ""going crazy"" and there are ""serious issues"" in the region. ""We don't know yet what dung beetles use to find their way home,"" he says."
"In Lebanon, they do three. In Saudi Arabia, they go one, two, and then they stay on the same side. ""I love coming to Doha. It's such an international place,"" he says. ""Every country is different and it's confusing, okay?"""

"The next time you're on an airplane in the US, just speak your mother tongue. That way no one knows what you're saying. The key is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as you're walking down the aisle."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to Doha, Qatar, to meet with the U.S. Embassy. He says he was surprised to find the embassy was closed for the day. Defterio: ""It's a great city, but it's growing so fast."""
"Every second, more than an hour of video gets uploaded to YouTube. 58 photos are uploaded to Instagram a second. More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook. By the time I'm finished talking here, there'll be 864 more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started."
"Hurricane Sandy brought volumes of media like we'd never seen before. The only problem is, when you have that much information, you have to find the good stuff. We had to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms. It was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at a visualization of the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Square on the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign. The visualization was done by an Italian academic, and it's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation, but what you get is hints at who is more interesting."
Markham Nolan: How do you find out if a video is real? Nolan: The only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account. Nolan: We didn't know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name. We used free Internet tools to do so.
"CNN's John Defterios has been following the Syrian civil war for more than a decade. He says the search for truth in the country has led him to YouTube videos of alleged war crimes. The video shows bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge, he says. Defterio: ""This is where YouTube actually becomes the most important repository of information"""
CNN's John Defterios went on the hunt for a missing bridge in Syria. He used Google Maps and satellite images to find the bridge in Hama. He says the bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west. The bridge also has the distinctive black-and-white curbing seen in the video.
"Markham: ""There's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been"" He says algorithms are smarter than ever before, but truth is never binary. ""Truth is emotional, it's fluid, and above all, it is human,"" he says."
"Mallory's argument that leaving the house, embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun doesn't tally that neatly with his own experience. The furthest he's ever got away from his front door was in the spring of 2004. His plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean. No one had ever done this."

"Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars, and each driver drives about 80 percent less because they're now paying the full cost, all at once, in real time. Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they're selling it in a marketplace. Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do."
"Robin Wright is the founder and CEO of French car-sharing service Buzzcar. She talks about the difference between industrial production and peer production. Wright: Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent service that works fabulously. But what does peer production do?"
"Peers, Inc. lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors. Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community. Peers provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems."
"Peers, Inc. brings the power of a corporation to individuals who add their cars to the network. Some people call this peer-to-peer. It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay, or craft fairs are thesame thing as Etsy."
"CNN's John Sutter asks people if they would be willing to test a new product. The product claims to reduce stress and improve mental health. Sutter: ""I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago. But I'm glad I didn't"""
"The promise of neuroscience has led to some overblown, unproven claims. The first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people's thoughts and emotions. According to scientists, a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions."
"The insula is involved in memory, language, attention, even anger, disgust and pain. The insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published. Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups."
SpECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain. The broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan. Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business.

"Israeli-Iranian tensions have been escalating in recent weeks. Israel's prime minister posted images of himself and his daughter holding the Israeli flag on his Facebook page. Iranians responded with their own posters of their own. Israeli posters, Israeli images, but also lots of comments, messages from Iran."
"Morton Bast: Israelis and Iranians sending the same message, one to each other. Bast: ""This is two people supposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war, and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say, ""I like this guy. I love those guys"""

"As a child, I was terrified that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping. It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children. The same incredible imaginations that produced ""The Origin of Species,"" ""Jane Eyre"" and ""The Remembrance of Things Past"" also generated intense worries."
"Fears and storytelling have the same components. Like all stories, fears have characters. Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends. Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel."
"Fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense. Fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature. In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another. How we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives."
"The men of the whaleship Essex, whose story would later inspire parts of ""Moby Dick,"" were terrified of cannibals. After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food as they knew they might, and they were still quite far from land. When the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive."
"The men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part of reading. The problem was that they listened to the wrong story. They responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid, the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture."
"The U.S. dollar has been one of the most long-standing, stable, reasonable currencies. The longer we delay any solution, the more the world will look to the dollar as a place that can't resolve its own fights."
"The fiscal cliff is the self-imposed, self-destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem. The more we address it as a practical concern, the sooner we can resolve it, and the more time we have to resolve it. The act of compromise itself, and sustained, real compromise, would give us even more time."

CNN's John Sutter says the U.S. is not a nation that's powerfully divided on fiscal issues. Sutter: The vast majority of Americans want to protect military defense spending. He says Democrats and Republicans are divided on raising taxes on the wealthy.
"Americans are not as divided as people might think, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: Most Americans are not partisan, and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between. The vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp."
"CNN's John Sutter says Americans are remarkably open to compromise. He says it's almost impossible to find Americans who are consistent ideologically. Sutter: The vast majority of people, they pick and choose, they see compromise. ""Think of it as a tiny, tiny number of ancient ideologues,"" he says."
"CNN's Richard Quest has been meditating since he was 11 years old. He says the practice has helped him cope with a number of life's challenges. Quest: ""We are so distracted that we're no longer present in the world in which we live"""
"""I think the present moment is so underrated,"" says the monk. ""When did you last take any time to do nothing?"" he asks. ""It was a really very stressful time. It gave me a greater appreciation of the moment"""
"Meditation is a practical, scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy. The beauty of it is that even though it need only take about 10 minutes a day, it impacts our entire life. It's more about stepping back, seeing the thought clearly, witnessing it coming and going without judgment."
"We live in an incredibly busy world. Of course in meditation -- we're going to end up falling asleep. So we're looking for a balance, a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement. At other times, we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much."
"The Dalai Lama says meditation can help us let go of patterns of mind. He says we can't change every little thing that happens to us in life, but we can change the way that we experience it. ""All you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day to step back,"" he says."
"In the last 50 years, the incidence of dengue has grown thirtyfold. Dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally. In fact, we spend more time looking after our cars, our clothes and our hair than we do our mind."
"Aedes aegypti is a mosquito that came, like its name suggests, out of North Africa, and it's spread round the world. A single mosquito will only travel about 200 yards in its entire life. Mankind has transported these eggs all the way around the world, and these insects have infested over 100 countries."
"The mosquito has killed more humans than any other creature in human history. Madeira first got the insect in 2005, and here we are, a few years later, first cases of dengue. The first way is that you use larvicides. You use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed."
"The mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague, says Morton Bast. Bast: 'There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there' 'We want something that gets that population right the way down so it can't get disease transmission'"
"You want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue, but you don't really want toget all the other insects. Some are quite beneficial to your ecosystem. This one's not. It's invaded you. You just want to getting this one. And finally, you want something that's species-specific."
"Oxitec has been working on the technology for the last 10 years. The company has done field trials in the Cayman Islands, Malaysia and Brazil. Oxitec says it has taken the mosquito population down by about 85 percent in about four months."
"We've got a production unit in Oxford, or just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos. We can produce about 20 million a week. And now what we're doing is we're going through a process to scale up to a town of about 50,000. So we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory."
"CNN's John Sutter is a member of the Asteroids Club, a club for all Americans who are willing to admit that the other side might have a point. Sutter: ""I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies don't work well or have become unacceptable"""

"Levin: The social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable. He shows graphs showing the national debt as a percentage of America's GDP. Levin: We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II, and the baby boomers haven't even retired."
Psychologist says morality binds and blinds. It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality. Large-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet. There are only a few species on the planet that can do this without kinship.
"When people circle something together, they unite, they can trust each other, they become one. But even as morality binds people together into a unit, into a team, the circling blinds them. We begin separating everything into good versus evil. It is a gross distortion of reality."
"In the 1980s and '90s, conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in Congress. The force field got cranked up, and Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart. Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare."
"In the 70s on a 100-point scale, Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise. But when you look at cross-party ratings, you find, well, that it's lower. The moral electromagnet is turning back on, and nowadays, Democrats really dislike Republicans."
"Hansen: Most people going to Congress are good, hard-working, intelligent people. But they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship, he says. Hansen: There are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this."
"A simple change to the legislative calendar, such as having business stretch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home, would change the fundamental relationships in Congress. Nothing pulls people together like a common threat or a common attack, especially an attack from a foreign enemy."
"Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers. Within a decade or two, most American children will be born into homes with no father. The left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children."
"Morton Bast: We are becoming a nation of just two classes. Bast: When Americans go to college and marry each other, they have very low divorce rates. Bast says if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders, we'd see that these two problems actually are best addressed together."
"Diving is an arts practice that can remake one's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar.

"Research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty, endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems. The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable. Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials."
The best way to get the most out of your health care is to get it right. The most effective way to do this is to make it easy for people to get better health care. The best way is to ensure that the health care system is working as it should be.
Morton Bast: Researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed. Bast: We owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way.

"Comparing your rates of dying 50 degrees north -- that's the South, that's London and places -- by latitude, and 55 degrees -- the bad news is that's here, Glasgow. We are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go. And vitamin D has had a great deal of press, and a lot of people get concerned about it."
"Vitamin D is good for the heart, but not for the rest of the body. The higher a person's vitamin D level, the less likely they are to suffer from heart disease. Vitamin D is found in the body through the skin and in the blood."
"The skin produces nitric oxide, which lowers blood pressure and stops angina. The molecule is a simple molecule, a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together. It's hugely important for our low blood pressure, for neurotransmission, for many, many things."
" dermatologist Morton Bast says sunlight can activate the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans. Bast: ""We couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice"" Bast: Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation, and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system?"
"Vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story. So we used ultraviolet A, which doesn't make vitamin D. When we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh, what we produced was a rise in circulating nitric oxide."
"The study looked at the effect of ultraviolet light on the blood vessels. It found that when the sun shone on the skin, there was no change in blood flow. But when it shone on other parts of the body, the blood flow was affected."
The skin has large stores of nitric oxide as well as other forms. The sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects. Australians have about a third less heart disease than we do. We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within Britain.
"Sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer, but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher than deaths from skin cancer. Within Britain, there is a gradient of health -- and this is what's called standardized mortality, basically your chances of dying. But it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain."

SAGES started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge.

"Domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races, all religions, all income and education levels.

"At this level of the labor market, what you need is a marketplace for spare hours. They do exist. Here's how they work: A distribution company has said, we've got a rush order. It's found 31 workers. They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings."
"A market research company has inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing. The company is monitoring their reliability. It's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly, if they're to work at all. But is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market?"
"Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years, but only for organizations at the top of the economy. A modern market is more than a website; it's a web of interoperable marketplaces, back office mechanisms, regulatory regimes, liquidity sources and so on."
Morton Bast: Politicians are taking it for granted that modern markets are the preserve of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves. Bast: There is a precedent for technology-enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful.
"Gambling was an unqualified success, but could we use the same model for economic activity at the base of the pyramid? Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short. And it's a series of markets for low-level trade that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company."
"Government could be forced to invest in e-commerce if it wants to compete with private sector. It would have to find a way to pay for all the services it provides, such as home care. But it would also have to be able to make a profit from the service."
"Research suggests this could unlock around 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity in a country the size of the U.K. It's small trades by small people, but it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate."
"Scratch is a free, open-source computer programming software. It's used by schools, businesses, nonprofits and other organizations. Scratch was used to create interactive Mother's Day cards for children. The project was inspired by the children's love of their mothers."
"Young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies. But that doesn't really make you fluent. And that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs, or code. In recent years, there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites helping young people learn to code."
"In Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together. In this case, you take a move block, snap it into a stack, and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters. After you've created your program, you can click on ""share,"" and then share your project with other people."
"This is an example from a new version of Scratch that we'll be releasing in the next few months. It uses the webcam. And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons or I can move the bug. So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect, where you interact with gestures."
"LZ Granderson: When you learn to code, it opens up other areas of your life. LZ: I saw a game where the big fish eats the little fish, and I wanted to keep track of that. He says in Scratch, you can create a variable that increments the score. Lz: I wonder if anyone else has thought to put up a Mother's Day card."
"""Scratch"" is a free, open-source computer programming program. The program teaches students how to use variables, or computer programs, to solve problems. It's also a great way for kids to learn about the process of design, says the creator."
"Coding is a way for people to express themselves in a variety of ways. It's not about becoming a professional writer, it's about being able to express yourself in any way you want. The idea for this project came from a mother who wanted to teach her daughter how to code."

"Doha's water supply is made possible by a giant machine called desalination. Doha's population is expected to grow to nine billion by 2050. The population is also changing their diets, which affects the water supply. Qatar's water supplies are made possible through a gigantic, mammoth machine called Desalination, which uses energy."
Qatar has only two days of water reserve and imports 90 percent of its food. The country is also facing declining yields because of climate change and other factors. Qatar has been working on a sustainable solution to its water crisis for the past two years.

But politics fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people, he adds. 'This is politics, not from top down, but from the bottom up, and sideways, and allowing everybody's voice to be heard is exactly what we need'"
"Asphalt is a noisy material, and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, then we would like a silent road. The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt. Porous asphalt has pores and water can just rain through it, so all the rainwater will flow away."
"Asphalt is a porous material with a small amount of binder between the stones. Due to weathering, due to oxidation, this binder, this bitumen, the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink. If it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks, and it delaminates from the aggregation."
"Morton Bast: We made a material using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers and using induction energy. Bast: If we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road, which of course saves a lot of money. Bast says he will do a trial to see if the healing works."
"I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured. My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time. He insisted that his daughter, my mom, go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father."
"Ilyse Hogue is a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign to educate women. She cofounded SOLA, the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan. Hogue: ""My family believes in me. I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me"""
"Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds. Today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan. ""Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,"" she says. ""Every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that"""
"High-performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next school. The most impressive outcomes of world-class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system. The goal of the past was standardization and compliance. Now, the goal is to make sure that every school succeeds."
Knowing what successful systems are doing doesn't yet tell us how to improve. PISA doesn't venture into telling countries what they should be doing. But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing. The example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control.
"PISA tests students' ability to apply what they have learned to new situations. The test of truth in life is whether we are prepared for change, says PISA chief. PISA measures 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy. The world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared."
"OECD's PISA test measures the knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds around the world. In some countries, the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very, very strong. A lot of potential of young children is wasted."
"Spending per student only explains about less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries. Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system, doesn't do particularly well. Korea also invests into long school days, which drives up costs further."
"Luxembourg and Germany spent 35 percent less on education than the U.S. in the year 2000. Germany featured in the lower quadrant, below average performance, large social disparities. Germany used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you count people who have degrees."
PISA has pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany. A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage. A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools.
"The U.S. was first on PISA in the '60s; now it's in the green quadrant. Poland, Portugal and Hungary have all improved their education systems. The question is, can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere?"
"High-performing countries have convinced their citizens to value their future more than consumption. The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success. If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe, parents expect every student to succeed."
"High-performing systems share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum. They provide an environment in which teachers work together to frame good practice. They set very ambitious standards, but then enable their teachers to figure out, what do I need to teach to my students today?"
" complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations, so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here. What looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction. This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system."
"There is a strong belief, which I share, that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis. The nodes in the network are the system's components, and the links are given by the interactions. So what equations are for physics, complex networks are for the study of complex systems."
"Morton Bast: Ownership networks can give answers to questions like, who are the key players? Bast: A high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability, because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic. Bast: We started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007."
"The TNC network contains 600,000 nodes and one million links. In the center, there's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies. 36 percent of the TNCs are in the core only, but they make up 95 percent of total operating revenue."
"With each euro he invested, he was able to move 26 euros of market value through the chain of ownership relations. This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26. 737 top shareholders have the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the TNCs' value."
"The high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy. Our study ""is an impression of the moon's surface. It's not a street map,"" says Dr. Michael Bociurkiw."
"In the beginning, the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire. The more connected I became, the more responsible I felt, the less I was able to let go in your presence. The third child doesn't really come back. So what happens, if you want to sustain desire, it's that real dialectic piece."
"At the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs. The need for security, for predictability, for safety, for dependability and for permanence. But we also have an equally strong need for adventure, for novelty, for mystery, for risk, for danger, for the unknown."
"The crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination, he says. Good intimacy does not guarantee good sex, contrary to popular belief, he adds. Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession."
"Se: ""If there is a verb that comes with desire, it is ""to want"" In love, we want to know the beloved. We want to minimize the distance. But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone"""
"In desire people rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other. When I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance, where this person that is already so familiar, so known, is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive."
"""There is no neediness in desire,"" says the author. ""I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them"" ""Novelty isn't about new positions. It's about what parts of you are just being seen"""
"The author explores the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love. ""It's sexuality transformed by the human imagination. We are the only ones who can make love for hours, have a blissful time, multiple orgasms, and touch nobody,"" he says."
"""Eroticism is the ability to imagine it, as if it's happening, while nothing is happening"" ""We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation, which is a mortar to desire"" ""The central agent is really that piece called the imagination"" ""I'm noticing that everywhere where romanticism has entered, there's a crisis of desire"""
"""I turn myself on when, I turn on my desires, I wake up when ... I don't feel like I have a right to want, to take, to receive pleasure,"" he says. ""The erotic mind is not very politically correct,"" he adds. ""If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses, we wouldn't be having such interesting talks"""
"""I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection with you,"" says the author. ""I will leave you in order to go experience pleasure"" says the mother. ""You are not the only one who can do this,"" says her daughter. ""We are not alone"""
"Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring the difference between English and Chinese. Linguists say the two languages have very different ways of expressing information. ""It rained yesterday,"" ""It will rain tomorrow"" is not the same as ""it rained today"""
"English is the only Germanic language that divides time into present and future. In Chinese, for example, ""It will rain tomorrow"" is not the same as ""it will rain today"" This leads to the question: Why do countries with similar economies and institutions differ in this way?"
"If you speak a futureless language, the present and the future, you speak about them identically. If that makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present, that's going to make it harder to save. pockets of futureless speakers all around the world turn out to be, by and large, some of the world's best savers."
CNN's John Sutter has been collecting data on the relationship between language and savings. He is using data from around the world to create a map of the relationship. Sutter says the map can be used to test whether or not the relationship is real.
"There are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself. Futureless language speakers, even after this level of control, are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year. By the time they retire, futureless language speaker, holding constant their income, are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings."
Futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely to be smoking at any given point in time. Some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year. The goal is to provide people with tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers.
" Neuroscientists are trying to extract from brain symphonies the messages they carry. We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora that became one of the superstars of this field. Aurora liked to play video games. She likes to use a joystick, like any one of us, any of our kids."
"Aurora played a game without moving her body. Her brainstorms would control an arm that would move the cursor and cross the target. Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm, but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms."
"Scientists have developed a way to train monkeys to touch objects in a virtual world. The objects send an electrical message to the monkey's brain, informing the brain what it is the avatar is touching. This is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor."
"The brain is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe. Neuroscientists could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer, because we are dealing with a system that's only comparable to a galaxy. Our violins, our cars, our bicycles, our soccer balls, our clothing -- they all become assimilated by the brain."
"The Walk Again Project is a nonprofit consortium putting together scientists from Europe, the U.S. and Brazil to work to get this new body built. Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms into action, into movement. The group's idea is to use these brain-machine interfaces to read these signals and send them to a new body."
"As a kid, I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid-'60s watching a few crazy guys telling [us] that they would go to the Moon. My mother was denied an education, and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living. So they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk."
"Joseph Geni: I wanted to become a teacher. I worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade, it was a determining factor. In our tradition, there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women, and it's a rite of passage to womanhood."
"The day before the actual ceremony happens, we were dancing, having excitement, and through all the night we did not sleep. The actual day came, and we walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting. And as we danced and danced, we approached this circle of women, men, women, children."
"The clitoris is cut off with a rusty old knife with no anesthesia and no anesthesia. ""I'm lucky, I never died, but many die,"" she says. ""My mom did something that most women don't do. She cut it off. I bled"""
"The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors, the girls to be mothers. The men of the village said, ""What a lost opportunity. This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this."" So I had to go back to the tradition."
"When she was five years old, she was engaged to be married as soon as she reached puberty. At 13, she underwent female genital mutilation. Three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation, she says. ""I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education"""
"After graduating from the U.N. and going back to school, the constant cry of these girls was in my face. I wanted to do something. I learned that my mom had a right to own property. I also learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman."

But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example,"" she says."
"In the early 1970s, Trinidad and Tobago had a massive increase in the country's wealth, caused by the increase in world oil prices. The treasury was bursting with money. The second important myth to understand is the one that says that in fact corruption is only a small problem."
"In 1982, 30 years ago it reported -- the Ballah Report -- the government-to-government arrangements were stopped. The then-Prime Minister told us that, in fact, two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent was wasted or stolen."
"Four months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country. A suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects. We are dealing with perverts of an economic and financial nature. There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms."
"Morton Bast: The Piarco Airport project cost about 1.6 billion dollars, Trinidad and Tobago dollars. Bast: We had a lot of bid-rigging and suspicious activity, corrupt activity took place. The Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement said one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts."
"CNN's John Defterios is the host of ""This Is Life"" on CNN.com. Defterio: ""This is the story of my life. I've been through a lot of things. I want to make sure that I don't repeat any of these things"""
"In an unprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day signed, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors. Nowhere on the planet have all the creditors been bailed out in excess of what their statutory entitlements were."
CNN's John Defterios has been working on a series of stories about corruption in the Trinidad and Tobago government. He has asked the government to explain why it is taking so long to respond to his questions. The government says it is only responding to requests for information from the public.
"""It is an economic crime, because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money,"" he says. ""Here is not like anywhere else. The point I'm making is that it is a crime. That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars coming out of a small -- we used to be resource-rich"""
The minister says the Freedom of Information Act should be used to force disclosure of 24 billion dollars in government money. He says the Ministry of Finance has not even asked CL Financial to file under the act. The minister says there is a massive amount of corruption in the private sector.
"CNN's John Defterios looks at how the world's insects fly. He says they use a vortex to generate enough force to stay in the air. Defterio: ""It's the same as corruption in the public sector, but it's also in the private sector"""
"The fly has two types of flight muscle: so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated and does not need to be controlled by the nervous system. attached to the base of the wing is a set of little, tiny control muscles that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast. This is what enables the fly to change its wing and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces."
The evolution of insect flight is perhaps one of the most important events in the history of life. The halteres are actually gyroscopes that beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight. A fly's brain is the most common form of brain on the planet.
"Morton Bast: ""We have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can do"" Bast: A mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly. Bast: Without insects, there'd be no flowering plants."
"CNN's John Sutter is a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego. Sutter: ""I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons"" ""I would argue that flies do more,"" Sutter says."
 neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot? And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs. Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill.
"Eve Marder and her colleagues have been studying a fascinating system that shows how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many, many,Many things because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis. This is basically multiplexing in time. It's part of their visual guidance system."
"Scientists have been able to record from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight. The whole fly brain is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion, and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons."
"Happiness is not something we find, it's something we make. Greatness is not a matter of circumstance. It's a matter. of choice. You just need to take small steps, accumulate small wins, keep reaching for that green stick. In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all."
"Jeff Sutherland was frustrated with how software got designed in the 1980s. He and his wife, Eleanor, turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development. Agile development is spreading from manufacturers in Japan to startups in Silicon Valley. The Starrs say the system increased communication and decreased stress."
"In the 1980s, companies followed the waterfall method, in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below. Eighty-three percent of projects failed. Sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time. Today, agile is used in a hundred countries and it's sweeping into management suites."
"David Sutherland and his wife created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores. Sutherland: ""In the workplace, adults love it. With kids, it's heaven"" Even the Sutherlands told me that they had an Agile Thanksgiving, where you had one group of people working on the food."
"Following the agile model, we ask three questions: What worked well in our family this week, what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead? Everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on. This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts."
"The word ""agile"" entered the lexicon in 2001 when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto. ""I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto,"" he says. ""What's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change"""
"""Adapt all the time"" means something deeper, too. We have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones from shrinks or self-help gurus or other family experts. The truth is, their ideas are stale."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to 1,000 children about the role of parents in their lives. Sutter: Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win. Empower your children. Enlist the children in their own upbringing, he says."
"Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules, evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives. ""We have to let our children succeed on their own terms, and yes, on occasion, fail on their Own terms,"" he says."

"Parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong, and more time focusing on what they are doing right. Researchers at Emory gave children a simple ""what do you know"" test. Do you know where your parents went to high school?"
"""Do you know who you are?"" is the most important question to ask your children. Tell your story of how you overcame a difficult situation. ""All happy families are the same,"" says author John Sutter. ""It's not about making learning happen, it's about making it happen"""

"The School in the Cloud will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in.

"Kallikuppam had caught up with his control school in New Delhi, a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher. When he saw that graph he knew there is a way to level the playing field. The Victorians actually did it. At 12, we know what they're like today."

The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here. Ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals. Chris Anderson: I remind you that I am talking about most of the world's land.
"Allan Savory: About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying. The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and get more on this that we could share along with the talk."
"When we damage soils, you give off carbon. Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. Desertification is caused by livestock, mostly cattle, sheep and goats, overgrazing the plants, leaving the soil bare and giving off methane. This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality."

"Climatologists and scientists have no other option but to use livestock to address climate change and desertification. We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change. We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature, and we've done so, and look at that."
"Humanity had never been able to deal with nature's complexity, he says. He developed what he calls holistic management and planned grazing.

"When I was a kid, I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing. One day, I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body. I didn't want to tell my grandmother because I was scared I'd get in trouble."
"The author grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with her. She and her sister were bullied at school. They were told to stay inside for recess, or learn to stay still like statues. She doesn't think she's beautiful because of a birthmark that takes up half her face."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a group of young people about their experiences of growing up in a tough neighborhood. Sutter: ""It's hard to be yourself when you're in a place where you feel like you're not good enough"" Sutter says he and his friends are still trying to figure out how to be themselves."
"""We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them"" ""We stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called,"" she says. ""We are graduating members from the class of We Made It, not the faded echoes of voices crying out, ""Names will never hurt me"""
"""We want it to read that we changed the world, and that part of that was by changing the way we think about these things,"" he says. ""If we can have that kind of generosity, then the non-profit sector can play a massive role"""
"The U.S. has one of the highest rates of poverty in the world, according to a new report. The report says it is the result of a lack of investment in social services. The U.N. says there is a need for more social services, especially in the poorest areas."
"The median compensation for a Stanford MBA, with bonus, at the age of 38, was 400,000 dollars. The average salary for the CEO of a $5 million-plus medical charity in the U.S. was 232,000."
"""I don't want my donation spent on advertising, I want it to go to the needy"" ""Being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative thing I have ever done"" ""If we tell the consumer brands, ""You cannot advertise all the good that you do,"" where do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow?"""
"""If you can't raise more revenue, you can's't possibly solve large problems,"" says David Frum. ""You can't take the kind of risks that the for-profit sector takes,"" he says. Frum: ""We're dealing with problems that are massive in scale, and we can't do anything about it"""
"The Puritans were taught that self-interest was a sure path to eternal damnation. Charity became this economic sanctuary, where they could do penance for their profit-making tendencies. Financial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others, so it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself."
"Donations to charities should be increased, not cut, says David Cameron. He says fundraising can multiply the amount of money available for the cause we care about. Cameron: ""I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward"""
"Net income for breast cancer research went down by 84 percent, or 60 million dollars, in one year. charitable giving is two percent of GDP in the U.S., but only 20 percent of that goes to health and human services causes. The rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals, and that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough."
"Psychiatric disorders are disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion, mood and affect. Using drugs to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block. If we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders, we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain."
"Morton Bast: Can an organism like a fruit fly teach us anything about emotion-like states? Bast: Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors. Bast: By doing this kind of test, we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons."
"Dr. Insel: ""We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone"" ""So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp,"" he says."
"Seymour: Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain, including in attention, arousal, reward, and disorders of the dopamine system. Seymour: We discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs. The gene that was affected in this mutation, it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor."
"In ADHD, it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability. But in flies we can actually test this. And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics."
"Dopamine is not bathing the brain of flies like soup, says Chris Anderson. The same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain, he says. Anderson: ""It's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup"""
"Stewart Brand: ""We interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct"" ""We changed the whole ecosystem they were in by letting them go,"" he says. ""We will get woolly mammoths back,"" Brand says."
"The last passenger pigeon died at a Cincinnati zoo in 1914. Passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist. All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue, because down in there is what is called ancient DNA."
"With good techniques now, you can basically reassemble the whole genome. George Church has a machine called the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine. It's kind of like an evolution machine. The precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides, points out that there's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair."
Pigeons were once a mile wide and 400 miles long. Now they're extinct. Scientists are trying to re-create the birds by replacing their genes with those of the passenger pigeon. They hope to find out exactly what genes matter to the pigeon.
"35 scientists met to see if they had work to do together. Three of them are recreating extinct ecosystems in northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii. The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle, and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed."
"At the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species over the last 35 years. When it's frozen that deep, minus 196 degrees Celsius, the cells are intact and the DNA is intact. They're basically viable cells, so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology took some of that tissue from an endangered animal called the Javan banteng."
"Birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton. The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987. Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo, there's 405 of them now. That technology will be used on de-extincted animals."
"In 1981, Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct. There were just 254 left. Now there are 880. The secret is, they have an eco-tourism program, which is absolutely brilliant. It was the cheapest source of protein in America. A bit of cloning, you can get them back."
"CNN's Jim Boulden looks at the impact of the Arab Spring on the world's wildlife. He says it's a good time to look at how we can protect the species we love. Bouldens: We need to protect species that are threatened by climate change, like birds."
"Since the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium, there are eight million more AIDS patients getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs. There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have their death rates cut by 75 percent. That's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day."
"The number of people living in extreme poverty has declined from 43 percent of the world's population in 1990 to 33 percent by 2000. The rate is still too high -- still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives. If the trajectory continues, we get to, wow, the zero zone."
"In the last decade, 10 countries have had a combination of 100 percent debt cancellation, a tripling of aid, and a tenfold increase in FDI. This has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources, which, when spent wisely, has cut childhood mortality by a third."
"We know that the biggest disease of all is not a disease, it's corruption. We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it. There's a vaccine for that too. It's called transparency, open data sets."
"Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has launched a campaign to fight corruption. He says technology is making it harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff. He is encouraging young people to take control of their own lives. He believes that by 2030, robots will serve us Guinness."
"CNN's Jake Tapper says he has Wael Ghonim's words tattooed on his brain. He says the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power. Tapper: ""We are going to win because we don't understand politics"""
"Morton Bast is a social scientist by training. He says we don't know enough about high-tech composites our future will be made of. Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities, he says. There's barely any information available on how to use them, Bast says."
"Many of these do-it-yourself practices were lost in the second half of the 20th century. The biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment. So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials, we should know and understand them."
"Makers are creating new ways to make electronic devices. They are using materials like copper tape and conductive fabric. The more people who try new things, the better they are likely to be, says Hannah. ""We are not afraid to fail,"" she says, ""because we are always trying to improve"""
"Morton Bast: The Internet was built on the principle of ""from each according to their ability"" Bast: It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War. Bast: There's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days, and so we dealt with that by making walled communities."
"In April, traffic between U.S. military installations started getting re-routed through China. China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake, but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort. Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks. So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States or Western civilization these days, they're not going to do it with tanks."
"In the early days of the ARPANET, a single message processor got a bug in it. Every message in the Internet started getting switched through this one node. The interesting thing was, though, that thesysadmins were able to fix it."
"The Internet is changing so quickly that even the experts don't know exactly what's going on. The Internet is turning into one of these big emergent systems, where we've designed all the parts but nobody really understands how it operates. Nobody knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago."
"There is no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept to be independent of the Internet. This doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project. It's actually relatively simple to do, technically, because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground."
"A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s. Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine. Many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark. Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the Amnok River."
"""I thought my life was over. But I managed to control all the emotions inside me,"" she says. ""It was a miracle. I was so scared. I thought I was going to die,"" she adds. ""I thought I would be sent back to North Korea"""
"Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea. Even after learning a new language and getting a job, their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant. We are all Korean, but inside, we have become very different, due to 67 years of division."
"""I saw my first public execution when I was seven years old,"" he says. ""My family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside"" ""I had to guide them through more than 2,000 miles in China, and then into Southeast Asia"""
"""I was so close to freedom, but I didn't have enough money to pay the fine"" ""I'm not helping you, I'm just trying to help my family,"" he says. ""I don't want to leave you behind, I just want to help you"""
"""The kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need"" ""We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world"" ""I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding"""
"Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket is about the size of a 12-story building. The rocket is constantly adjusting the angle, the pitch  and yaw of the main engine, and maintaining roll with cold gas thrusters. ""I don't know, actually. I don't have a good answer for you,"" he says."
"Physicists boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy. Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics. So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation, it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport."
"Elon Musk: ""All modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets"" ""There's just no way around Newton's third law,"" he says. ""This may sound like simple advice, but hardly anyone does that, and it's incredibly helpful"""
"Elon Musk: ""The responsiveness of the car is really incredible"" ""You can certainly drive -- if you drive it 65 miles an hour, under normal conditions, 250 miles is a reasonable number"" ""We wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car"""
"Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the company is working on a nationwide network of fast charging stations. By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive from L.A. to New York just using the Supercharger network, he says. Tesla's Supercharging technology charges at five times the rate of anything else."
"The world is almost entirely solar-powered already, he says. Solar will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas, he adds. ""We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun, and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization"""
"EM: Solar power doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs, so once it's installed, it's just there. CA: Most of American electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. EM: I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas."
"SolarCity raises capital from companies and banks. The company installs the panel on the roof and charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill. ""I think it's actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses,"" says SolarCity CEO."
"SpaceX's Elon Musk says he made a bet with a friend that in 18 years, we'll see more power from solar than any other source. Musk: We came very close to failure, but we managed to get through that point in 2008. The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology, he says."
"""I did build rockets when I was a kid, but I didn't think I'd be involved in this"" ""I think there's a fundamental difference, if you sort of look into the future, between a space-faring civilization and one that is confined to Earth"" ""There's a long list of innovations that we've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate"""
"EM: The cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small. Every mode of transport that we use, whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses, is reusable, but not rockets. So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization."
"Morton Bast: What is it to make a therapeutic, anyway? Bast: A drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen. Bast: It's those shapes that determine whether, in fact, that particular drug will hit its target."
"The FDA has approved a drug for cystic fibrosis for the first time. The drug doesn't treat all cases of the disease, and it won't work for Danny Bessette. But it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long."
"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria is the most dramatic form of premature aging. Because of a mutation in a gene, a protein is made that's toxic to the cell. This has led, in the space of only four years, to the start of a clinical trial."
"The average life expectancy of a person with progeria is less than two years. The disease is so rare that a drug to treat it has been developed for cancer patients. The drug is not available for people with other types of progeria, such as emphysema."
"The first drug for HIV/AIDS was not developed for HIV. It was developed for cancer. NIH has started a new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. It just started last December, and this is one of its goals."
"The Wyss Institute in Boston has created a chip that turns cells from an individual into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung. You can do this same kind of chip technology for kidneys, for hearts, for muscles, all the places where you want to see whether a drug is going to be a problem, for the liver."
"This is research that's high-risk, sometimes high-cost. The payoff is enormous, both in terms of health and economic growth. We need the best and the brightest from many different disciplines to come and join this effort. This is the 21st-century biology that you've been waiting for."
The data was created using a new visualization tool from Autodesk. The data shows the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria and bacilli in different parts of the building. The shape of the pink lobe in the data tells you something about the abundance of each group.
"The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago, and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability to structure biomes the way that they want to. If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another, they have very similar ecosystems. But if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away, the ecosystem is fundamentally different."
"Joseph Geni: Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi. Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone. The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods."
"The key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch. When you touch a pencil, microbial exchange happens. If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings, this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways."
"Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely, which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely. The lights trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed, but I was sleeping in my bed. The bulbs face outside, because that's where the lions come from."
"""I used to hate lions, but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict"" ""I want to make an electric fence. But I know electric fences are already invented, but I want to made mine"" ""My big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up"""
"Lion was one of six cows that died in Nairobi last week. ""We believe that we came from heaven with all our animals,"" he says. ""And that's why we're so proud of them,"" he adds. ""They're our pride and joy"""
"The coating is filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface. nanoparticles reach up and grab the air molecules, and cover the surface with air. It's an umbrella of air all across it, and that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits and the concrete hits."
"Nanotechnology spray can be applied to almost any material. No water, no corrosion. It could be anti-bacterial. Without water, the bacteria won't survive. It's called Ultra-Ever Dry. When you apply it to any material, it turns into a superhydrophobic shield."
"The rounder a car is, the more hydrophobic it is. A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees. An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do. We're going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience."
Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics used mostly in economics and political science. It predicts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else. Game theory was developed in the '90s by Rosemarie Nagel and others.
"The study looked at the difference between playing humans versus computers. It found that when playing people, the brain was more active than when playing the computer. The study was one of the first to tie game theory to brain activity. The research could help scientists better understand the development of adolescent brains."
"Two people are playing a game of ""bargain"" in which they try to get more money than the other. The players are told how much they will get if they make a deal in 10 seconds or less. The game is called ""hide-and-seek"" and takes place on a computer."
"The two sides of a coin are supposed to agree on how much to divide. But when they disagree, the coin goes to the other side of the coin. The coin is supposed to go to the person who agrees on the least amount of money. But in this case, the money goes to both sides."
"The arrows connect regions that are active at the same time. The direction of the arrows flows from the region that's active first in time, and the arrowhead goes to the region later. The hope is that we can say something in the first couple of seconds about whether they'll make a deal or not."
Charles Darwin and I broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago. We share more genes with them than zebras do with horses. They have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas. How humans and chimpanzees behave differently might tell us a lot about brain evolution.
"The study is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa. He had a bold idea he called the ""cognitive trade-off hypothesis"" We know chimps are faster and stronger; they're also obsessed with status. So we're going to check that out by having the chimps play a game."
"Game theorists look at the behavior of a pair of players trying to match, one trying to mismatch. The theory predicts that they should match 50-50, because if you play left too much, for example, I can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right."
"CNN's John Sutter: People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind. He says chimps play better than the humans, in terms of adhering to game theory. Sutter says early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict whether there'll be a bad disagreement that costs money. ""Chimps are ""better"" competitors than humans, as judged by game theory,"" he says."
"Morton Bast: The United States is Lesterland. Bast: Democracy is dependent upon the Lesters and dependent on the people. The trick is, to run in the general election, you must do extremely well in the money election."
"In the United States, of 311 million people, 144,000 are called Lester. In this sense, the funders are our Lesters. Candidates for Congress and members of Congress spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time raising money."
"Lester: ""The vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters"" ""In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland,"" he says. ""The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal"" ""It's bipartisan, equal-opportunity corruption,"" he adds."
"Lesterland is a system that's designed to save the status quo of big and invasive government. It works against the left and the right, and that, you might say, is good news. But it's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption, because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election."
"Lester: ""There is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption"" ""We need a government that works for the left or the right, the citizens of the left and right"" ""There will never be a Christmas. We will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first,"" he says."
"Rep. Steve Israel says reform would shrink K Street, which has become a ""farm league for K Street"" Israel: Reform doesn't require a constitutional amendment, changing the First Amendment. Israel: To do this would require a single statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections."
"""This is a solvable issue. It's solvable not by being a Democrat, not by a Republican, but by being citizens,"" he says. Even if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant. Change the incentives and the behavior changes, and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his love of the U.S. Sutter: ""Even we liberals love this country"" Sutter's son was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. He says he would do everything he could to help his son."

An electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle can be charged in 15 minutes. It uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car. The vehicle can cover about half of the car trips in the U.S. alone.
"CNN's John Sutter takes a look at a remote control airplane. Sutter: ""The performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently, you can really change things"" ""The portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco"""
"Karl Marx said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing. Adam Smith had a very important notion of efficiency. He said pins have 12 different steps, and if one person does all 12 steps, production is very low. The Industrial Revolution was the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency."
"In the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx. But the reality is that we've switched, and now we're in the knowledge economy. The good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them, we could get people to be both more productive and happier."
"""We gave people Legos, and we asked them to build with Legos"" ""We will take all these Bionicles, we will disassemble them and use it for the next participant"" ""If you remember the story about Sisyphus, and how he was punished by the gods"""
"Researchers asked people to build a Bionicle for three dollars. If they said yes, they built it. Then they asked them to build another one for $2.70. As they were building it, they took apart the one that they just finished."
"People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude. People who love Legos would build more Legos, even for less money, because after all, they get more internal joy from it. People understand that meaning is important, they just don't understand the magnitude of the importance."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a group of young people about their love of Lego. Sutter: ""We basically eliminated any joy that they could get out of this activity"" ""How many of you now go home earlier than you used to?"" Sutter asks. ""And they didn't raise their hands"""
"Researchers asked participants to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other. They also asked people to write their name on a sheet of paper and have the experimenter look at it and say ""Uh huh"" The participants came up with all kinds of ideas for new technology."
"In the acknowledged condition, people worked all the way down to 15 cents. At 15 cents per page, they basically stopped these efforts. In the shredder condition, it was twice as much -- 30 cents per sheet. But I should point out, by the way, that people could have cheated."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how people can improve their motivation. Sutter: ""Ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes"" ""The good news is that adding motivation doesn't seem to be so difficult,"" he says."
"The IKEA effect got people to love what they're doing to a higher degree, he says. ""It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say, ""Here is my cake"" Instead, people go down, and after they recover, they go up again."
"We asked people how much they wanted to pay for a piece of origami. They were willing to pay five times more than people who just looked at it. We tried to make it more difficult. For some people, we made it harder by hiding the instructions."
"Researchers have created self-folding proteins that can be used to build complex structures. The proteins are programmable and self-assembling. They use passive energy, heat, shaking, pneumatics, gravity, magnetics and smartly designed interactions."
"The crambin protein is a three-dimensional structure of a protein. The idea is that you take the backbone and break it down into a series of components. When I throw this up into the air and catch it, it has the full structure of the protein, all of the intricacies."
"The idea behind 4D printing is that you take multi-material 3D printing and you add a new capability, which is transformation. The parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own. And this is like robotics without wires or motors."
MIT's Self-Assembly Lab is trying to develop programmable materials for the built environment. MIT is working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec to develop a new paradigm for piping. Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate.
"Nanoscale technologies can help solve problems on the human scale, he says. They can program physical and biological materials to change shape, change properties, and even compute outside of silicon-based matter. There's even a software called cadnano that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes."
"""Jeopardy"" is about people who are curious about the world around them. The show is a good example of how we can live in a world where our brains continue to be the thing that makes us special, or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to supercomputers."

"The hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships, physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use GPS. The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important. The things we know are still important to us."
"CNN's John Sutter says it's impossible to know all the facts about the world. Sutter: ""There's just too much to know"" He says the world needs to know as much as possible about its history, culture, and politics."
"A 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand. She runs up to them on the beach one morning and says, ""Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."" Her parents thought about it, and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his love of game shows. Sutter: ""I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete"" He says cultural literacy has been replaced by ""bubbles of specialty"" Sutter says knowledge is what makes us who we are."
"Romo is an iPad app that allows users to play with the robot. The app is free and available on the App Store. It's available for iOS, Android and Blackberry devices. It was developed by the same team that created the app for the iPhone."
"Romo is a robot that can be controlled by a camera attached to his head. The camera can also be used to take pictures of the robot's face and body. The robot can also take a picture of its owner, who can then send it to the camera."
Romo streams two-way audio and video between any two smart devices. You don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him. It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo.
"The future of personal robotics is happening today, and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves. So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use, whether you're eight or 80."
"Romo is a robot that uses a device you already know and love -- your iPhone -- as his brain. Romo is wi-fi enabled and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks, which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past."
"The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC, was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King, in 1963. ""What you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born,"" King said."
"Meyerhoff Scholars program was started in the '60s to help African-American and Hispanic students. The program has produced a number of people in law, all the way to the humanities. ""We produced great artists. Beckett is our muse,"" he says."
"Only 20 percent of blacks and Hispanics who begin with a major in science and engineering will actually graduate. Only 32 percent of whites who begin. with majors in those areas actually succeed and graduate in. those areas, and only 42 percent of Asian-Americans."
"Ilyse Hogue: It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students. She says high expectations have to do with curiosity and encouraging young people to be curious. ""It's not about how smart you are, it's about how curious you are,"" Hogue says."
"Johns Hopkins professor of psychiatry and neuroscience says students need to feel a sense of responsibility. Students need to understand each other, build trust among them, and learn how to ask good questions, he says. ""We all are products of our childhood experiences,"" says Johns, who grew up in Alabama."
"Duke professor: ""It takes researchers to produce researchers"" ""You need scientists to pull the students into the work,"" he says. ""Building community among those students is very important"" ""We have now developed this model that is helping us, not only finally with evaluation"""
"The president of the University of Maryland says students need to be engaged in class. He says the university is redesigning courses to focus on the humanities and social sciences. ""It is amazing how the dreams and the values can make all the difference in the world,"" he says."
"Freeman: ""Choice, not chance, determines your destiny"" ""We need to invent what I call a personal health system,"" he says. ""The problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally"" ""It's unaffordable globally,"" he adds."
"CNN's John Sutter shares an ultrasound image of his new friend, Libby. Sutter: ""This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have"" ""It's not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here,"" Sutter says."
"Eric Dishman had a series of fainting spells as a college student. He had a kidney transplant and developed fluid around the kidney. The fluid is not growing, it's not creating any problems, he says. Dishman says he's happy to have the opportunity to look at the fluid."
Morton Bast: We have to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks-and-mortar place for all of our care. Bast: I want to share some personal friends and stories with you that I've actually never talked about in public before to help illustrate the idea and the need and the hope for us to reinvent our health care system.
"The future of personal health says care must occur at home as the default model, not in a hospital or clinic. Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members. Many of us will have implantables that will actually look real-time at what's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins."
"CNN's John Sutter is working on a project to make health care a team sport. Sutter: ""I should have been happy that I could go back to my normal doctors, but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team"""
"The future of health care is smart teams, and you'd better be on that team for yourself. We're trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors. I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom, if somebody else can help me."
"Intel is working on ways to make computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours. Tracey Gamley: ""I only had one night in the hospital. The surgery was done laparoscopically, so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen"" ED: ""It's up to us to care for, and even save, one another"""
The British Association for the Advancement of Science is holding its third annual conference in London. The conference will focus on the history of science and technology in the UK. The first meeting of the group took place in Cambridge in 1812 and was led by Charles Babbage.
"Herschel and his philosophical breakfast club felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century. Reading one of Herschel's books was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin that he would later say, ""Scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me"""
"Babbage's analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense. It was programmable using punched cards, an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom. Two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years by a team from the Science Museum of London."
The British Association was formed in 18th century. It was the first organization of women in the UK. Women were allowed to be members of the Association. The Association was founded to help women in their careers. It also helped women in other areas of their lives.
"Only 28 percent of American adults have even a very basic level of science literacy. Charles Darwin said, ""I sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work"" Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten, that science is not only for scientists."
"Diseases like to travel in one gram of human feces. The most common symptoms associated with those diseases, diarrhea, is now a bit of a joke. ""It's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits. Where I come from, we call it Delhi belly,"" he says."
Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide. The cost to the world is immense: 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation. The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal.
"25 percent of girls in India drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation. The humble latrine, or flush toilet, reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water. Poop can cook your dinner. It's got nutrients in it."
"In Rwanda, they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners' bowels. Scientists in Canada have now created a stool sample, a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate. The cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent."
In India now there's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don't have a toilet. The idea is to manipulate human emotion. The soap companies did it in the early 20th century. We need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware.
"The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is reinventing the toilet. Priyanka Chopra's village in India had no toilets whatsoever. Chopra: ""It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful and really exciting"""
"The World Health Organisation's Millennium Development Goal is 50 years off track, says UNICEF. The world's poorest people are not going to meet targets to improve sanitation, the UN says. Japan has gone from using pit latrines to using Woshurettos, washlet toilets with bidet nozzles and heated seats."
"There are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States. That means one about every 15 minutes. 90 percent of suicides are related to a mental illness. Nearly 30 percent of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders, neuropsychiatric syndromes."
"One in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime. Fifty percent will have onset by age 14, 75 percent by age 24. These are, indeed, the chronic disorders of young people. The federal government pays my salary."
"Joseph Geni: What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders, diseases of the mind. He says we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders. Geni says we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality from heart disease."
"The author was a quadriplegic after a bus crash in Jerusalem. He says he is mindful of what he does not have, but also what he has. He writes: ""If the gods are kind, you may truly enjoy what you have. That is the one singular gift"""
"CNN's John Sutter recalls the day he broke his neck in a car crash 21 years ago. The accident left him with quadriplegia and left him unable to walk or speak. Sutter found his driver, Abed, and asked to meet with him, but was turned down."
"""I'm sorry"" was the last thing I wanted to hear from the man who broke my neck. ""I wanted to know what I had done to deserve this,"" he says. ""What I did to deserve it"" is a question that has haunted him since."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his struggle with depression. Sutter was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 18. He says he's been struggling with depression ever since. He's been in and out of the hospital since then, but never been seriously ill."
"Abed, who had lost his teeth in a car crash 16 years ago, was expecting me. He told me he'd just had surgery on his eyes, and had problems with his side and his legs too. The pair sat together on a couch at his home in Jerusalem."
"In 1990, Abed broke two necks and bruised one brain in a car crash. The crash changed both of their lives. Twenty-one years later, he was thinner than his wife, his skin slack on his face. Abed said the crash was the fault of a driver in the left lane who did not let him pass."
"Abed said he'd lived an unholy life before the crash, and so God had ordained the crash. He'd served six months in prison, lost his truck license for a decade. It is a pity, he said, ""that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers"""
"""I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash,"" the driver says. ""I once went 60 in a 40,"" he adds. ""It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize,"" says the driver. ""No matter how stark the reality, the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable,"" he says."
"""We have to be in the good and enjoy the good,"" says the author. ""A crash is from God and so a broken neck is good,"" he adds. ""We must live in the moment and not be afraid of the future"""
"Morton Bast won the World YoYo Contest when he was 18 years old. Bast: ""If I make enough effort with huge passion, there is no impossible"" ""For the first time in my life, I found my passion,"" Bast says."
"Morton Bast: Neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common, and it was also quite common about 7,000 years ago. Bast: There are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appetite. Bast says he follows a long tradition of neurosurgery, and what he's going to tell you about today is adjusting the dials in the brain."
"About a hundred thousand patients in the world have received deep brain stimulation. Deep brain stimulation is used to treat disorders of movement, disorders of mood and disorders of cognition. With a remote control very much like a television remote control, we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain."
"In Mesoamerica, there used to be neurosurgery, and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients. In this case, we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons. We started using this technique in other problems, such as Parkinson's disease."
"In patients with depression, areas of the brain are shut down, and those are the areas in blue. The other thing we discovered was an area that was overactive, area 25, seen there in red, and area 25 is the sadness center."
"Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat Parkinson's disease, dystonia and depression. Scientists are now using it to turbocharge the memory circuits in the brain. They hope to turn back online the frontal lobes of the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease."
"20 percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain. As you go from being normal to having mild cognitive impairment, then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose. This is analogous to having a power failure in an area of thebrain."
"The technique could help treat Parkinson's disease, depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's. It involves engineers, imaging scientists, basic scientists, neurologists, psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and certainly at the interface of these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement. We're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain."
"Linguists have shown that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way, we tend to speak in word packets of maybe seven to 10 words. Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic -- very different from writing. The idea is that texting spells the decline of any kind of serious literacy."
"The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event. The point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing. It's almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand, and then communication is limited. The problem was just that in the mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day."
"""LOL"" used to mean ""laughing out loud,"" but now it means something different. The new way of using the word ""laugh"" is more complex. ""I love the font you're using, btw. I love your font,"" a woman writes."
"LOL is being used in a very particular way. It's a way of using the language between actual people. Linguists call things like that pragmatic particles. Any spoken language that's used by real people has them. ""LOL"" is a marker of empathy."
"In 1956, texting didn't exist; ""I Love Lucy"" was still on the air. Texting has developed one from this slash: ""I'm watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye"" In real life, if we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic, there are ways of doing it."
"In 1917, the President of Harvard complained that his freshmen couldn't spell. In 1841, some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset because of what he has for a long time ""noted with regret the almost entire neglect of the original"" Texting is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today."
"If humanity had existed for 24 hours, then writing only came along at about 11:07 p.m. That's how much of a latterly thing writing is. It maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s, and then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note."
The United States has grown at 2.0 percent per year from 1891 to 2007. The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices. Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents.
"Two-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years. That means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000. But we're not going to do that, and the reason is the headwinds. The first headwind is demographics. The next is education."
"Growth rate of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages in the 15 years before the financial crisis. By 1929, electric light was everywhere. Central Manhattan became possible. Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women."
"In the late 19th century, the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen. By 1929, certainly by 1950, we had central heating everywhere. Before the motor vehicle, transportation depended entirely on the urban horse, which dropped 25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day."
"In 1885, the average North Carolina housewife walked 148 miles a year carrying 35 tons of water. By 1929, cities around the country had put in underground water pipes. Electrification, central heat, ownership of motor cars, they all went from zero to 100 percent."
"By 1960 we had telephone bills, bank statements were being produced by computers. The 1980s brought us Bill Gates, DOS, ATM machines to replace bank tellers. There are four headwinds that are just hitting the American economy in the face. They're demographics, education, debt and inequality."
"Growth has been decoupled from jobs, and income of the typical worker is stagnating. So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline. If innovation is less powerful, invents less great, wonderful things, growth is going to be even lower than half of history."
"Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history. The new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production. When goods are digital, they can be replicated with perfect quality at nearly zero cost, and can be delivered almost instantaneously."
"In the age of big data, we can measure the world in ways we never could before. Computers get better faster than anything else ever. The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up, like low-hanging fruit. But each innovation creates building blocks for even more innovations."
"Morton Bast: Growth is not dead. Bast: Machine learning is perhaps the most important invention in human history. He says the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out. Bast says we are building intelligent machines, but some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating."
"Technology is racing ahead, but it's leaving more and more people behind, he says. The answer is not to try to slow down technology, but to learn to race with the machine, he adds. ""We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever, but a majority of Americans, their income has fallen"""
"The new machine age can be dated to a day 15 years ago when Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, played Deep Blue, a supercomputer. General purpose technologies drive most economic growth, because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations, like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign."
"Drivers are tasked with navigating partially-seen roadways, in and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds. All you have to guide you are your two eyes. You can't really directly sense the world around you. In countless accidents, the driver says, ""I didn't see it coming"""
"In the future, with cars exchanging data with each other, we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind, to the right and left, all at the same time. With computation and algorithms and predictive models, we can see the future."
"Car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages 16 to 19 in the United States. 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol. With computer vision, I can estimate where the cars around me are, sort of, and where they're going."
"Using a series of three cameras, we can detect if a driver is looking forward, looking away, looking down, or having a cup of coffee. We can predict the accident and we can predict who, which cars, are in the best position to move out of the way to calculate the safest route for everyone."
"Morton Bast: I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs. Bast: By sharing our data willingly, we can do what's best for everyone. ""It's going to make the roads a lot safer,"" Bast says."
"Just hit the space bar twice. The phone puts the period, the space, and the capital for you. No need to go to the recent calls list if you're trying to call somebody. If you want to redial somebody that you've dialed before, just hit the call button."
"Google's search engine is also a dictionary. Type the word ""define"" and the word you want to know. There's the definition as you type. It's also a complete FAA database. It shows you where the flight is, the gate, the terminal, how long until it lands."
"If you pre-focus with a half-press, leave your finger down -- no shutter lag! You get it every time. You can go double-click, drag, to highlight in one-word increments as you drag. Shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera snaps."
"On the web, if you want to scroll down, don't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar. Hold down the Shift key to scroll back up again. Don't open the pop-up menu where you put in your state."
"CNN's John Sutter asks people to walk 20 to 30 miles a week. Sutter: ""You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking"" ""More than cars or the Internet, the technology you're using the most almost every day is your tush"""
"Morton Bast: ""Sitting is so incredibly prevalent, we don't even question how much we're doing it"" Bast: I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world. Bast: Is fission kind of played out, or is there something left to innovate here?"
"CNN's John Sutter talks about nuclear proliferation. Sutter: ""We built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, and that was great, and we don't need them anymore"" ""What are we doing with all the waste, essentially?"" Sutter asks."
"In a nuclear power plant like this, it's only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient. The reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature. This reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas, so supercritical CO2 or helium, and that goes into a turbine."
"Morton Bast: I have a big announcement to make today, and I'm really excited about this. Bast: After Fukushima, I set out to design a power reactor that had to be passively and intrinsically safe. He says the reactor doesn't operate at high pressure, so there's no inclination for the fission products to leave the reactor in the event of an accident."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his passion for space exploration. Sutter: ""It's an amazing thing to be able to go into space and see the world through the eyes of a rocket"" Sutter says he hopes to use his experience to help people in need in the future."
"Ilyse Hogue: I graduated high school in May, and I decided that I was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies. I think that I've designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy, provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications. I'm really prepared to make this a reality."
"""I think Stephen Covey had the right idea. He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand, as opposed to being understood,"" Pierson says. ""Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship, or you don't,"" she says."
"""I am powerful, and I am strong. I deserve the education that I get here,"" says Ms. Pierson. ""I was somebody when I came. I'll be a better person when I leave,"" she says. ""You say it long enough, it starts to be a part of you,"" she adds."
"Morton Bast: Every child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them. Bast: Teachers become great actors and great actresses, and we come to work when we don't feel like it. Bast's mother left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear."
"James Comer: We're born to make a difference. We know why kids don't learn. It's either poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences. But one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value of human connection."
"It's not just the electronic tattoos, it's facial recognition that's getting really good. You can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names, although sometimes it does make mistakes. There's companies like face.com that now have about 18 billion faces online."
"Hippomenes beat Atalanta because she was distracted by golden apples. The great poet Jorge Luis Borges threatened people with death to get them to stop writing. And then, of course, there's Narcissus. Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them."
"Morton Bast: What happens if Facebook, Twitter, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, etc. all turn out to be electronic tattoos? Bast: And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would? He says it took a life-threatening situation to snap him out of his pseudo-teaching habit."
"The surgeon who saved a student's life gave her three rules to follow when teaching. Curiosity comes first, she says, then the messy process of trial and error. ""Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms? Some people nodding yes,"" she says."
"Riley is a metaphor for all kids, and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms. But if we as educators leave behind this simple role and embrace a new paradigm, we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day, and spark their imagination."
"Morton Bast is a chemistry teacher in Toronto, Canada. He says his students' questions are his greatest tool as a teacher. Bast: ""If we place these technologies before student inquiry, we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool"""
"Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3, he says. The unemployed don't need banks, he adds. ""It wasn't about the customers. It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them,"" he says of banks."
"""I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit to you all I'm a little old,"" he says. ""There's no way that machine is going to count that money right, I am never using that, right?"" ""If you come up with a plan to change things, people consider you radical,"" he adds."
"The system decides you can't run schools in the summer, he says. ""I always wonder, who makes up those rules?"" he asks. ""It just turns out in the 1840s we did have, schools were open all year, because we had a lot of folks who had to work"""
"Geoff Morton: ""Our business has refused to use science"" ""We know that the problem begins immediately,"" he says. ""The science is clear,"" he adds. ""As a profession, we have to stop this"" ""This is not something that is ordained from the education gods,"" Morton says."
"""We know health services matter. We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing,"" he says. ""This year, there are going to be millions of our children that we're going to needlessly lose, that we could -- right now, we could save them all"""
"""I do it because you do it for your kid,"" he says. ""Why shouldn't poor kids have the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children"" ""I believe you need data, you need information, because you work at something, and you find out it's not working"""
"I need to know you're struggling, and I need toknow whether or not what I did corrected that. I need that data in September, November. Billions and billions of dollars for data that it's too late to use. I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling."
Teachers need real information right now about what's happening to their kids. Some of it's not going to work. We can't stifle innovation in our business. Some charter schools don't work. A lot of them don't. They should be closed.
"Geoffrey Moore: America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right. Moore: Those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don't care how many millions of young people fail. ""We have to start with kids earlier, we have to make sure that we provide the support"""
"Gloria Borger: ""When the safety of America is threatened, we will spend any amount of money"" ""The real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place"" ""I dare say it's a pittance, what it would require for us to begin to solve some of these problems"""
"When kids know that you refuse to let them fail, it puts a different pressure on them, and they don't give up as easy. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit."
"Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out. The best idea about building grit in kids is something called ""growth mindset"""
"When kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, Bast says. Bast: We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them."
"After high school, I decided I wanted to be a teacher. Some teachers wrote me off as a lost cause. After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective."
"""I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me,"" she says. ""I share my background with my kids, because they need to know that everyone has a story"" ""We created a new school. And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media,"" she adds."
"The school is the first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District. ""We make our kids feel like they matter to us,"" says principal. ""They use all the technology that they're used to. Laptops, computers, tablets -- you name it"""
"Morton Bast: It's time that kids like me stop being the exception, and we become the norm. Bast: Why should our students have to go so far away from where they live? Bast: They need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances."
"The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. The shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, ""Help! I'm on fire!"" If someone walks behind, that is ""to follow"""

"Using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32. So with very little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters. But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China."
"Chinese is a language that can only be understood by a small group of people. It is difficult to learn the full language, but it is possible to learn some of the most important words in the language. This article is the first in a series of articles on the Chinese language and culture."
"Morton Bast: ""No wonder so many of my people spit bars, because the truth is hard to swallow"" Bast: I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day by regular janitors, but I never have the decency to honor their names. Bast: My high school is Chicago, diverse and segregated on purpose."
"In 2004, it rained in Death Valley. In 2005, the whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while. The real role of leadership is climate control, creating a climate of possibility. Great leaders know that, and schools that were bereft spring to life."
"In some parts of the country, 60 percent of kids drop out of high school. If we halved that number, one estimate is it would create a net gain to the U.S. economy of nearly a trillion dollars. What it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school but don't enjoy it."
"America spends more money on education than most other countries. The trouble is, it's all going in the wrong direction. There are three principles on which human life flourishes. They are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor."
"""No Child Left Behind"" is based on not diversity, but conformity. ""I just don't believe it's an epidemic like this,"" he says. ""A real education has to give equal weight to the arts, the humanities, to physical education"""
"The second principle that drives human life flourishing is curiosity. Curiosity is the engine of achievement. Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents, not just a small range of them. Children are natural learners. It's a real achievement to put that particular ability out."
"The whole point of education is to get people to learn, he says. An old friend of mine -- actually very old, he's dead -- used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs. You can be engaged in the activity of something, but not really be achieving it, like dieting."
"Part of the problem is that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning, but testing. ""In place of curiosity, what we have is a culture of compliance,"" he says. ""Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms"""
"We create our lives, and we can recreate them as we go through them. It's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic. We all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities. One of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of creativity."
"There is no standardized testing in Finland. They have a very broad approach to education, which includes humanities, physical education, the arts. They recognize that it's students who are learning and the system has to engage them, their curiosity, their individuality, and their creativity."
"The U.S. has a long way to go when it comes to education reform, says John Avlon. Avlon: ""The trouble is that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education"" He says the best way to improve education is to make it more accessible to all."
"Every student who drops out of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography. The point is that education is not a mechanical system. It's a human system. There are trends, but the stories are always unique."
"The U.S. is tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland in the world rankings for reading proficiency. The country has no formal system for helping teachers improve. ""The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk"""
"The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. We need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? We've been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country."
"Sarah Brown Wessling is a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Iowa. She says video offers a ""certain degree of reality"" for teachers. The videos and surveys from the students are helpful diagnostic tools, she says. ""I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it"""
"The video was shot using a flip camera and a wide-angle lens. ""I'm able to learn a lot from it,"" says Morton Bast. Bast: ""You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that"""
"Gates: We need to give teachers the tools they need to improve. Building this system will also require a considerable investment, he says. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal, says Gates. ""It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great career,"" he says, ""and have a chance to live their dreams"""
"Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20. There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now. We're talking about 15 percent of the population."
"Claiming your 20s is one of the simplest, yet most transformative, things you can do. 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35. Your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options."
"Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence. Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like ""twixters"" and ""kidults"" As a culture, we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood."
"When a lot has been pushed to your 30s, there is enormous pressure to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up, and have two or three kids. Many of these things are incompatible, and as research is just starting to show, harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s."
"""I didn't know the future of Emma's career, but I do know this: Identity capital begets identity capital"" ""Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next"" ""You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends"" ""Don't be afraid to ask for help"""

"The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one. Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want. One good conversation, one good break and one good TED Talk can have an enormous effect across years and generations."

"Intel CEO: The threat to worry about isn't strangers, it's strangeness. He says digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives. As people's relationships to the things in their lives change, so do their relations with other people, he says."
Morton Bast: Strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations. Bast: Security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks. Bast says technology could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships.
"In today's digitally intensive world, strangers are quite frankly not the point. The point that we should be worried about is, how much strangeness are we getting? Why strangeness? Because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data. And that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring a sense of robustness."

"With a plan and the right people, quality of life can remain high. Eighty percent of Americans die in a hospital or a nursing home. Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different. In both cases, last days are about quiet reassurance."
A plan involves answering straightforward questions about the end you want. What do you want in terms of medical intervention? And who's going to make sure your plan is followed? You will need advocates. Having more than one increases your chance of getting the endYou want. Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse.
"Jim and Shirley Modini had a good end of life, and by sharing their story with you, I hope to increase our chances of doing the same. You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation to determine whether an elder care community or staying at home is your best choice. When you believe it's okay to let go, you will."
"Jim and Shirley Modini spent their 68 years of marriage living off the grid on their 1,700-acre ranch in the mountains of Sonoma County. They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions."

Google Glass is a head-mounted computer with a built-in camera. It was designed to be used on the street and not in people's line of sight. The first prototypes were like cell phones strapped to your head. It's been two years since the project began.
"Morton Bast uses a cell phone as a camera to capture moments in his life. He says the device has helped him give back to charities. Bast: ""It really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away"""
"UNICEF: 6.9 million children are dying in China every day. The figure has been steadily coming down from 12 million in 1990. But still, 19,000 children die every day, UNICEF says. The answer is, yes, we can save some of those children."
"Many of the most significant people in effective altruism have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math. No one, not Andrew Carnegie, not John D. Rockefeller, has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three. According to one estimate, the Gates Foundation has already saved 5.8 million lives."
"The author of the book, ""The Power of One,"" says he wants to make a difference in the lives of people around the world. He wants to help people who are struggling to make ends meet. He says the world needs more people like him, who are willing to work hard and give back."
"Some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others, says Toby Ord. Ord: You could provide one guide dog for one blind American, or you could cure between 400 and 2,000 people of blindness. ""I think it's clear what's the better thing to do,"" says Ord."
"GiveWell assess the impact of charities, not just whether they're well-run. There is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations. Some effective altruists think it's very important to make sure that our species survives at all."
" effective altruism helps to overcome what I call the Sisyphus problem. It enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living. UNICEF reports that in 2011, 6.9 million children under five died from preventable, poverty-related diseases."
"An anonymous donation of a kidney can extend a person's life by up to four years. The act of donating a kidney is known as pointillism. An anonymous donation can extend the life of a person by as much as 5,000 years. An artist's approach to creativity can change his artistic horizons."

"Morton Bast created 23 different pieces of art with nothing left to physically display. Bast asked people to call him and share a story with him about a life-changing moment. Their stories became the art as he wrote them onto the revolving canvas. Bast: Each time I created, the destruction brought me back to a neutral place."

Morton Bast: Preservation and the survival of DNA depends on many factors. He says it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most. Bast: Most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures.
DNA sequencing of extinct mammoth genomes is a modern-day reality. Scientists can artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg and bring back something that looks like a woolly mammoth. There are swaths of habitat in the north of Siberia and Yukon that could house a mammoth.

"MoMA has acquired a Boeing 747 and a ""@"" sign in the public domain. These were some of the first acquisitions that really introduced the idea of interaction design to the public. MoMA has been trying to go even deeper into interaction design."
"MoMA is displaying Pac-Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh. A Guardian art critic suggested that games cannot qualify as art. MoMA is in the Highbrow quadrant of the museum's collection, which is daring, courageous and Brilliant."
"John Maeda came out with this big declaration on why video games belong in the MoMA. And that was fantastic. But then there was another wonderfully pretentious article that came out in The New Republic. It said, ""MoMA has mistaken video games for art."" Again. That misses the point."
"The Museum of Modern Art has acquired a collection of popular culture games. The collection includes Sim City 2000, Tetris, Pac-Man and Another World. The games are part of the museum's permanent collection of artworks. The museum's collection is expected to be expanded in the coming years."

"The museum has acquired 14 video games so far. The first 14 games are Portal, Street Fighter II and Flow. The museum hopes to acquire more games in the future. The games will be displayed in a museum in the city of St. Pancras."
"Video games are the purest aspect of interaction design and are very useful to explain what interaction is. Aesthetics are really important. Space, the spatial aspect of games is extremely important. Time, space, aesthetics, and then, most important, behavior."
"The games are displayed alongside other examples of design, furniture and other parts. There's no paraphernalia, no nostalagia, only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers. The controllers are, of course, part of the experience, so you cannot do away with it."
"The dominant group is rarely challenged to think about its dominance. This is one of the ways that dominant systems maintain and reproduce themselves. The way that we think, literally the way we use language, conspires to keep our attention off of men."

"The goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge those who are. ""In the end, what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends,"" King says. ""The typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted. He's a normal guy in every other way,"" he adds."
"There's been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men's violence against women and children, he says. The responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or college men."
"In a society with gender diversity and sexual diversity, you're failing at your leadership. There's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes, coaches, administrators.

"Opower delivers personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes. Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills. This year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities in six countries, we're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings."
Two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined for more than a year. Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted. That's 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity in the U.S. alone.

"Dolphins are born without spots, and they get spots with age. By about the age of 15, they're fully spotted black and white. We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water, since we're actually observing them physically. They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate."
"The signature whistle is a whistle that's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name. Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks. Males will stimulate a female during a courtship chase. So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance."
"In the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins. They synchronize their sounds and their body postures to look bigger and sound stronger. We know that their brain-to-body ratio, which is a physical measure of intelligence, is second only to humans."
"Scientists have used keyboard interfaces to try to bridge the gap with species including chimpanzees and dolphins. Cognitively, they can understand artificially-created languages. This underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida, at the Epcot Center was actually the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water."
"Divers and dolphins exchange information and request toys from each other. The keyboard is a portable keyboard that can be pushed through the water. The objects the dolphins like to play with are the scarf, rope, sargassum and a bow ride."
"Dolphins use rope whistles to communicate with humans. Scientists are trying to crack the code of the dolphins' communication system. Scientists use a rope toy to try to get the dolphins to respond to the rope sound. The rope toy is a scarf, which the dolphins use to communicate."
"The system uses the sound of a whistle to send a message to a dolphin. The dolphin then sends the message back to the human, who can then send the message to the dolphin again. The whole process takes just a few seconds, but it can take up to an hour if it takes too much time."
Dolphins are already able to communicate by using their own whistles. The new technology will allow them to communicate with each other in a similar way. The technology is being developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
"This is the best economic news we have these days for two main reasons. The first is, technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run.

"Pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience. Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity. The trigger for sexual activity, what happens during sexual activity and the expected outcome."
"When you talk to someone today in America about sexual activity, you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sex. That's often given to the girl. It starts with an internal sense, an internal desire, or a need. When you get together for pizza with somebody, the first thing you do is talk about it."
"When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza, isn't it all about what's our pleasure? There are a million different kinds of pizza. You may even negotiate it. You're also talking about baseball. Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive."
"In baseball, there's always a winner in the game, but in pizza, you don't look for a win. In sexuality education, we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires, to talk about it with their partners, and to look for what feels satisfying."
"Pizza is the way to think about healthy, satisfying sexual activity. ""What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"" is a question we can ask anyone. ""We overestimate technology in the short term, and we underestimate it in the long term,"" says the author."
"In the 1980s, P.C. computers were used to do calculations. Today, they are used to take care of tasks such as cleaning and caring for the sick. They are also used in hospitals to help nurses and doctors with their work."
"Chris Harbert: When it comes to factory robots, people are sort of afraid, because factory robots are dangerous to be around. In order to program them, you have to understand six-dimensional vectors and quaternions. And Baxter, I see, as a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting."
"Baxter is safe to interact with and feels the force, says Chris. The robot has a user interface that helps people understand where it is going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions. Chris: ""I am worried whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term"""
"Robots are shipping to factories around the country. People in factories say they don't want their children to work in a factory. ""I want a better job than that for my children,"" one factory worker says. ""We, our society, is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future"""
"Mildred is typical of today's factory workers in the U.S. They're older, and they're getting older and older. As their tasks become more onerous on them, we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with."
As we get older we get more frail and we can't do all the tasks we used to do. The fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time. And I really think that we're going to be spending more time with robots like Baxter.
Librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear in 1957. The number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after 1957. Storm chasing is a very tactile experience. Everything is interconnected. I've learned to respect the lightning.
"CNN's John Defterios is a member of a small fishing tribe on Long Island, New York. He says he was inspired by his grandmother to study the power of clouds. He has created a model of how a super cell can produce grapefruit-size hail."
"The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms, designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory. We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations. We then manipulate these equations with thehelp of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad."
"The system doesn't even know that the glass is there. All side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects. The lesson here is that some high-performance tasks are easier than others, and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and what ones are hard."
" quadrocopters are popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs: four. By controlling the speeds of these four propellers, these machines can roll, pitch, yaw, and accelerate. Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible."
"How do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort? This quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple, so not too large. The following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds, or 50 times per second."
The system uses a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming. The algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me. Mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second.
"The Flying Machine Arena research team are building machine athletes. Data is used to locate objects in the space that have reflective markers on them. This data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms. This in turn sends commands to the quad, which is also running algorithms."
"George Papandreou: ""We are closing in on ourselves in politics"" ""We have kept the potential, the huge potential of our society out of this process"" ""The fundamental idea of Europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders, go beyond our conflicts and work together"""
Greece's George Papandreou speaks at TED Talk. He says more Europe would give more power to the citizens of Europe. He also talks about the failure of leadership in global politics and in our globalizing economy. GP: Now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together.
"Greece is facing a moment of truth, says former Prime Minister Costas Karabellos. Karaballos: ""I had been elected on a mandate, actually, to tackle these problems"" ""I won't provide some feel-good, ready-made solutions,"" he says."
"Greece avoided bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided a collapse. But most would agree that Greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone. Our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws, evade taxes, evade environmental or labor standards."
"Greece's political leaders have lost the trust of their people, says Alexis Tsipras. ""We were led by our fears. And our fears led to a blind faith in the orthodoxy of austerity,"" he says. ""When riot police have to protect parliaments, then there's something deeply wrong"""
"Greece has weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe, but we remain challenged. I have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one of democracy. Democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities for public affairs."
"The EU is the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment, according to the UN. Europe should be an experiment in global democracy, a new kind of democracy, he says. The European agora should be a place where citizens can work together, deliberate, learn from each other, exchange between art and cultures."
"European citizens should have the power to vote directly for a European president, he says. They should also have the chance to study anywhere in Europe, he adds. He calls for a Europe of and by the people, an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders."
"In 2004, the U.S. drone fleet produced a grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis. By 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours, outstripping human ability to review it. The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes on each drone platform."
"Drones will have to shoulder more decision-making. Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs to parts unknown. In that environment, it is very likely that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories. It will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon."
"Citizens of high-tech societies are more vulnerable to robotic weapons. The reason can be summed up in one word: data. Cell phone geolocation, telecom metadata, social media, email, text, financial transaction data, transportation data, it's a wealth of real-time data."
"Automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea. The U.S. Department of Defense issued a directive requiring a human being be present in all lethal decisions. Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself."
"Every robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed I.D. that can be used to track its movement through public spaces. And in certain very high-security areas, perhaps drones would snare them and drag them off. It would allow us to use autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our open, civil society."
"Women in Saudi Arabia have been banned from driving for 20 years. The ban is a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women. ""It was a punishment for daring to challenge the society's rules,"" says Hijab."

"""Dragon-kings"" represent extreme events which are of a class of their own. They are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable, perhaps controllable. The root mechanism of a dragon-king is a slow maturation towards instability."
"Morton Bast: Most extreme events are actually knowable and predictable. He says there are many early warning signals that are predicted by this theory. Bast: We have applied this theory early on, that was our first success, to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements on the iron rocket."
"Theory is used in the early stages of pregnancy to predict when a baby will be born. It can also be used to predict epileptic seizures, landslides and the dynamics of success. The theory is also used to understand the failure of quantitative easing. It could also help to explain the global financial crisis."
"Didier Deschamps: ""When an instability has developed, and the system is ripe, any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control"" The Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded. The Chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to avoid any wave and control the stock market."

"The program aims to get people washing people once a day, particularly children. The highest priority, you see on the screen, is washing peopleonce a day. ""I'm not going to ask if you had a shower, because I'm too polite,"" says the presenter."
"Washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs, the common infectious diseases of the eyes, the ears, the chest and the skin that, if they occur in the first five years of life, permanently damage those organs. The ticks and crosses represent the 7,800 houses we've looked at nationally around Australia, the same proportion."
"Housing for Health tests houses to see if they have a working toilet. The project costs around $10,000 a year to improve the houses. ""We don't make promises, we don't do reports. It's very easy to spend money,"" says project leader."
"Housing for Health tests, checks and fixes 250 items in every house in Australia. The aim is to improve the health of the people living in the houses. Most of the work is due to lack of routine maintenance, says director of the charity."
"75 percent of the team in Australia are actually local, indigenous people from the communities they work in. In 2010, there were 831, all over Australia, and the Torres Strait Islands, working to improve the houses where they and their families live."
"Most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground, the wind-driven dust. So we used dirt to stop dust. We tested and we reduced the dust. Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally. So how do we do that? Well, we call up the doctor of flies."
"Nepal was asked by a small village of 600 people to make toilets where none existed. People were cooking on their only fuel source, green timber. Solution: Take human waste, take animal waste, put it into a chamber, extract biogas, methane gas."
"Nepal has built over 100 toilets in a village and a couple nearby. Well over 1,000 people use those toilets. The gas gives three to four hours cooking a day -- clean, smokeless and free for the family. Surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber when it's shed the gas."
"The Ushahidi is a free and open-source map-making tool. It was created by a group of people in Nairobi, Kenya, to help people in need. It has been used to help with disaster relief in Haiti and in the UK."
"The group is exploring the idea of collective intelligence. One of the biggest challenges remains is the electricity problem in Kenya. The other problem is that communication costs are also still a challenge. It costs five Kenyan shillings, or .06 USD, to call the U.S., Canada or China from Kenya."
"""If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere,"" says Ushidi. ""We wanted to redesign the modem for our context, and for our reality"" ""It acts as a backup to the Internet so that, when the power goes out, it connects to the nearest GSM network"""
"The BRCK has eight hours of battery left, so you can continue working. The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere. With load balancing, this can be possible. The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors -- is this idea that you could have an on-ramp for the Internet of things."
"The BRCK aims to keep Africans connected, and to help them drive the global digital revolution. Ushahidi means ""testimony"" or ""witness"" in Swahili. The connectivity situation has improved greatly, but some barriers remain."
"I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family. Suddenly, I became an orphan and homeless. My daily life became very hard, but very simple. My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash. I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets."

"In North Korea, I would wander the streets searching for food, and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother's back eating chips. He just looked back at me very warmly, but said no words. He reminded me of my father, who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry, even if he was starving. I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America, yet my father died of starvation."

"CNN's John Sutter: Muhammad's doubt brought him alive for me. He says fear was the only sane response, the only human response. Some conservative Muslim theologians say the account of his wanting to kill himself shouldn't even be mentioned. Sutter says doubt is essential to faith."
"Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes, they have no questions, only answers. They found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith. And yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority, have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority."
"The writer says he refuses to give in to the temptation of despair. He says the Koran says: Anyone who saves a life, saves the life of all humanity. The author says he has faith in the power of the Qur'an to change the world."
"Gayla's uncle is still alive to this day, and learning how to waltz. Her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever. The town had a vermiculite mine in it, used to make plants grow faster and better."
"Vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos. Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts, huge amounts of it put under the roof to keep houses warm during the long Montana winters. Gayla thought, when everybody knows, they'll want to do something."
"CNN's Jim Boulden looks at the role of willful blindness in the U.S. He found that 85 percent of people knew something was wrong, but didn't want to admit it. He also found that willful blindness was present in other parts of the world."

"Diabetes kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma. Despite exercising three or four hours every single day, he'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome. Once you're insulin-resistant, you're on your way to getting diabetes."
"Most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance. But what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem, the tip of a iceberg? ""I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign, but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two evils"""
"Morton Bast: Maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance. Bast: For many of us, the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat. He asks: Is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity? Bast: How much better would we be if we treated the cause -- telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room?"
30 million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance. Six million lean people in the U.S. are insulin-resistant. This suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on. The answer probably isn't too much food. It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.
"I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't. Some think it's too many calories consumed, others too much dietary fat, others refined grains and starches. I know it's tempting to want an answer right now, some form of action or policy. But we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription."
"""We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did,"" he says. ""Most of them actually want to do the right thing, but they have to know what that is, and it's got to work. Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science,"" he adds."
"The New Yorker is trying to make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us. The humor is self-reflective and makes us think about our assumptions. The New Yorker focuses on our obsessions, our narcissism, our foils and our foibles."
"""I Don't Get It"" is a weekly cartoon series on CNN.com. This week, Jarrett looks at a cartoon about a dog who wants to go for a walk. ""I don't get it,"" the dog says. ""What do you mean?"" ""The dog is saying, 'I want to go outside' """
"Morton Bast: In certain contexts, humor is right, and in other contexts it's wrong. Bast: ""In The New Yorker, it goes out to a wide audience, and when you actually look at that, and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at"" Bast: The subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting."
"Survey: About 85 percent of the people liked the cartoon. A hundred and nine people voted it a 10, the highest. Other people thought it was funny. That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor when you don't have the contagion of humor."
"The New Yorker only can take 16 or 17 cartoons, and we have 1,000 cartoons. The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does 10 or 15 ideas every week. But they mostly are going to be rejected. That's the nature of any creative activity."
"When it comes to humor, 75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for. The word ""cartoon"" is the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons. An idea drawing is something that requires you to think on your part to make it into a cartoon."
"The cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is, he says. It's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off. In ""No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"" what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message of being rude."
"BM: In here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker and the vulgarity of the language. He is both being polite and rude.BM: It's a cognitive synergy where we mash up these two things which don't go together and temporarily in our minds exist."
"""The Rejection Collection"" is not quite New Yorker kind of humor. It's actually put together by Matt Diffee, one of our cartoonists. Within a context of this book, which says, ""Cartoons you never saw and never will see in The New Yorker,"" this humor is perfect."
"The world really shouldn't be that way. Within the context of The New Yorker magazine, ""Asshead. Please help"" is a benign violation. Within that context, we feel it's okay. There is no such thing as funny in and of itself."
"""The Rejection Collection is absolutely in this field. The New Yorker occupies a very different space. It's a space that is playful in its own way, and also purposeful, and in that space, the cartoons are different,"" he says. ""If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough, they will laugh at very, very little"""
"The first week we did no cartoons. That was a black hole for humor, and correctly so. But the next week, this was the first cartoon. These cartoons are not about them. They're about us. The humor reflects back on us. It's called dispositional humor."
"A frog swallowed its fertilized eggs and turned its stomach into a uterus. In the stomach, the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles, which grew in the stomach until the frog was at risk of bursting apart. No animal, let alone a frog, has been known to do this, to change one organ in the body into another."
"I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach, but I am suggesting it's possible we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut. If we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works, is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves?"
"The Lazarus Project is focused on the gastric-brooding frog. We took the eggs of a related species, a living frog, and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg. And then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that egg."
The Thylacine Project aims to create a new species of marsupial. The first one occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia about 25 million years ago. The National Geographic Society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits. The project is funded by the National Geographic Foundation.
"Morton Bast: Australia was a fascinating place, but unfortunately, it didn't stay this way. Bast: We had, in Australia, drop crocs. They really do exist. But what they were dropping on was not only weird animals but also thylacines. Bast says he'd like it back."
"Thylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland, and after that they only survived in Tasmania. Europeans arrived in 1788, and they brought with them the things they valued, and that included sheep. Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep, but the thylacine got a bad rap. The government paid people to slaughter every one that they saw."
"In 1990, a scientist at the Australian Museum found a thylacine pup in a jar. The pup's mother had been pickled, and the pup's DNA was found in the pickled remains. The scientist decided to use the DNA to try and clone the animal."
Human DNA was found in the teeth of skulls. Scientists hope to get the DNA back into a viable form. The DNA could be used to bring a thylacine back to life. The project is funded by the National Museum of Natural History in London.
The Tasmanian devil is a marsupial that gives birth to babies the size of a jelly bean. Scientists have spliced thylacine DNA into a mouse genome. They put a tag on the DNA so that it would appear blue-green in the mouse baby.
"CNN's John Defterios goes back to the past to find out what happened to the Tasmanian thylacine. He meets a man who says he and his father used to live in the area. The man, who is now in his 90s, says he still remembers the thylacs."
The southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in 1926. The grasslands were sweeping away. The animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around. We need other parallel strategies coming online.
"Communism and democracy may both be laudable ideals, but the era of their dogmatic universalism is over. Let universality make way for plurality. Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us. Are we brave enough to welcome it?"

"Eric Li is a Chinese journalist and author. He was born in China, but was not born in the country. Li says there is a vibrant civil society in China but it's different to the way it is seen in the West. He says the concept of a 'civil society' in China is alien to Chinese culture."
"The number of democracies went from 45 in 1970 to 115 in 2010. In 30 years, China went from one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second-largest economy. Eighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation during that period happened in China."
"China is a one-party state run by the Chinese Communist Party, the Party, and they don't hold elections. Such a system is operationally rigid, politically closed, and morally illegitimate. Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of China's one- party system."
"Political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms, he says. Mao was the father of modern China, yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes. Every aspect of Chinese society, how the country is governed, are unrecognizable today, he adds."
"The Chinese Communist Party is one of the world's most powerful political parties. It is made up of civil service, state-owned enterprises and social organizations. The Party's Organization Department is the most powerful in the country. It has 25 members, including the president and the prime minister."
"The Organization Department runs a modernized version of China's centuries-old mentoring system. Once a year, the department reviews their performance. The process takes two to three decades. The best few move further up several more ranks, and eventually make it to the Central Committee."
"In 1949, when the Party took power, China was mired in civil wars, dismembered by foreign aggression. Today, it's the second largest economy in the world, an industrial powerhouse, and its people live in increasing prosperity. Pew Research polls Chinese public attitudes, and here are the numbers in recent years."
Most electoral democracies around the world are suffering from dismal performance. Corruption is widespread and undermines the system and its moral legitimacy. Most analysts misdiagnose the disease. The social and economic problems that come with wrenching change like this are mind-boggling.
"Transparency International ranks China between 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries. For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China, more than half of them are electoral democracies. Economic reform will accelerate, political reform will continue, and the one-party system will hold firm."
"The West's hubris is at the heart of the West's current ills, he says. ""I'm not here to make an indictment of democracy,"" he adds. ""On the contrary, I think democracy contributed to the rise of the modern world"""
"The only way to find out how many children were vaccinated in Indonesia is by knocking on doors. Sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this. And what makes it even worse is that, once you've collected all that data, someone -- some unfortunate person -- is going to have to type that into a computer."
"Vaccine-preventable diseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar can kill millions, he says. The data-entry part, the part that he used to do as a grad student, can take sometimes six months. Sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer."

"Magpi is an online form creator for mobile phones. It's cloud based, and it doesn't require any training, programming, consultants. Since it's already on a computer, we can deliver instant maps and analysis and graphing. It can be used on a smartphone, a basic Symbian phone, or even a laptop."
The software is based on the cloud and can collect data in real time. It has been used by charities such as the International Rescue Committee to track births and deaths. The software is also being used by Physicians for Human Rights to do rape exams in Congo.

"The English language has written into it negative associations towards the clouds. The bad press that clouds get is totally unfair. I think we should stand up for them, which is why I started the Cloud Appreciation Society. Tens of thousands of members now in almost 100 countries around the world."
"The society exists to remind people of this: Clouds are not something to moan about. They are, in fact, the most diverse, evocative, poetic aspect of nature. To tune into the clouds is to slow down, to calm down. It's like a bit of everyday meditation."
"The Kelvin–Helmholtz cloud is made up of very, very cold water droplets. This freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards with the ice crystals cascading and falling down below. These clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere."
"Cumulus clouds are the embodiment of the powerful, elemental force and power that drives our atmosphere. To be there is to be connected in the driving rain and the hail. It's to be reminded that we are creatures that inhabit this ocean of air."
"The author says we need to take a break from our hectic lives to enjoy the beauty of the clouds. He says that being in the present is good for the soul and good for your creativity. ""People think of clouds as things that get in the way, but they don't even notice the clouds,"" he says."
"MIT has created a virtual world in which we can see and move 3D pixels. The virtual world was created by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies. Students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion, physics."
"The power of computing has become accessible to everyone. Designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen. The digital information will start directly acting upon us as part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world."

"CNN's John Defterios has been working with Global Witness since 1993. He has spent time working with former Nigerian oil minister Abacha. Defterio: ""It's easy to think that corruption happens in countries we don't know about"""
"Until his death in 2006, he was the all-powerful leader of Turkmenistan, a Central Asian country rich in natural gas. He didn't do all of this in his own name either. He used shell companies. He did business with global banks. A bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at the problem of corruption in Africa. He says the problem is driven by the secrecy of the international banking system. Defterio: ""It's not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money"""
"A recent study by the World Bank looked at 200 cases of corruption. It found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies. Many of these companies were in America or the United Kingdom, its overseas territories and Crown dependencies. In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated, shell companies have appeared."
"In 2011, natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The Nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount, to the very dollar, to an account earmarked for a shell company whose hidden owner was Dan Etete."
"Corruption is too complex and difficult to change, says campaigner and investigator. Two thirds of the value of the world's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws. In a globalized world, corruption is a truly globalized business, says Global Witness."
"In Vancouver, the redwood forest grows to 40 stories tall. But the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on Earth. The challenge is, as we move to cities, cities are built in steel and concrete, and they're great materials."
"Eight percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from building materials. Steel represents about three percent of man's emissions. One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide. wood is the only material, big material, that I can build with that's already grown."
Wood is the only major material building material I can build with that actually does both those two things. We need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger. We've been working on is 30-story tall buildings made of wood. These buildings are available for architects and engineers now to build on.
"""We can use fire science to predict and make these buildings as safe as steel"" ""The last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees"" ""We'll grow enough wood in North America every 13 minutes. That's how much it takes"""
"""We're at the beginning of a revolution, I hope, in the way we build,"" he says. ""I've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column"" ""The challenge is changing society's perception of possibility, and it's a huge challenge"" ""It's really just the structure that we're talking about. It's not the technology,"" he adds."
"""I'm looking for this opportunity to create an Eiffel Tower moment"" ""I like to think that wood gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings"" ""We'll need something like C3PO to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines"""
"The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is funding a project to design a spacecraft to get to the nearest star in 100 years' time. What we're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us, ultimately, how we might interact with an alien from another world."
"NG: So this is scalable video infrastructure, not for a few to a few but many to many. VC: We're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins. NG: This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work, and we just got our first seed money."
"Dolphins are very different from us in body form and environment. They come from a radically different environment. We're separated by 95 million years of divergent evolution. I wondered how we might interface with these animals. In the 1980s, I developed an underwater keyboard."
"Peter Gabriel: I grew up surrounded by animals, and I would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there? Gabriel: This dolphin has self-awareness. Gabriel: How can we create interfaces, new windows into the minds of animals, with the technologies that exist today?"
"Dolphins aren't the only animals, the only non-human animals, to show mirror self-recognition. Sue Savage-Rumbaugh got excited about that, called her friend Steve Woodruff, and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring, which led us to Diana."
"Vint Cerf: ""I was struck in the history of the Internet"" ""I realized we had missed something, which is the rest of the planet"" ""We used to think this was a uniquely human ability, but we learned that the great apes, our closest relatives, also show this ability"""
"Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas, uses iPads to help stimulate and enrich the animals. The National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland, is committed to excellence in animal care, to research, and to conservation. The dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what's going on here tonight, says Allison Ginsburg."
Josh Plotnik is with Think Elephants International. The foundation is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world. Vint Cerf is one of the founders who gave us the Internet. The Internet was designed by Bob Kahn and Vint Cevallos.
"The Internet of Things is a system for connecting computers and other intelligent animals together. The system is designed to connect 400,000 networks, run independently by 400,00 operating agencies. The only reason this works is that they all use the same standard TCP/IP protocols. The production version of the system uses IP version 6."
"The sensor would have to be: inexpensive, rapid, simple, sensitive, selective, and minimally invasive. All kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system. We're beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn't just another person."
"Protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers, at high levels in the bloodstream. Key is that it's found in the earliest stages of the disease, when someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival. When he was 13, a family friend who was like an uncle to him passed away from pancreatic cancer."
"CNN's John Sutter tries to use paper to detect pancreatic cancer. Sutter: ""You start with some water, add some antibodies, mix it up, and you can detect it"" Sutter says he sent a proposal to 200 professors at Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health."
"The sensor is 168 times faster, over 26,000 times less expensive, and over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection. Over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late, when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival. The sensor has close to 100 percent accuracy, and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages."
"The Internet is a neutral space, where what you look like, age or gender -- it doesn't matter. Theories can be shared, and you don't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued. Today's current ""modern"" medicine is a 60-year-old technique."
"When he began recording in the late '60s, the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species. Now, because of global warming, resource extraction, and human noise, it can take up to 1,000 hours or more to capture the same thing. 50 percent of his archive comes from habitats so radically altered that they're either altogether silent or can no longer be heard in any of their original form."
"The Amazon rainforest is home to a vibrant animal orchestra, says David Perry. Perry recorded dawn choruses in Lincoln Meadow before and after selective logging. Perry: The density and diversity of that biophony has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation."
"The Great Basin Spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard-panned desert soil of the American West. When there's enough moisture in the soil in the spring, frogs will dig themselves to the surface and gather around large, vernal pools in great numbers. And they vocalize in a chorus that's absolutely in sync with one another."
"The soundscape is made up of three basic sources. The first is the geophony, or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat. The other two are the sounds of the natural world, like wind in the trees, water in a stream, waves at the ocean shore."
"The author has lived in Japan for the last 25 years, but says he is more international and multi-cultured than many of the kids he meets there. He says his whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole. The last word goes to a jaguar from the Amazon."
"CNN's John Sutter says home has less to do with soil than with a piece of soul. Sutter: The number of people living in countries not their own now comes to 220 million. He says the president of the strongest nation on Earth is half-Kenyan, partly raised in Indonesia, has Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law."
"In Canada's largest city, Toronto, the average resident is what used to be called a foreigner. The beauty of being surrounded by the foreign is that it slaps you awake. Many of the people living in countries not their own are refugees who never wanted to leave home and ache to go back."
"""I don't think I've really earned the right to call myself an Indian,"" he says. ""Where you come from is much less important than where you're going"" ""I was the only kid in all my classes who didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes"""
"The author spent three days in silence in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. He says the silence was not an absence of noise, but a presence of energy. The author was inspired by the stillness of the ocean and the beauty of the landscape."
"""It was really all the freedom I know when I'm traveling, but it also felt like coming home,"" he says. ""It's only by stepping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most care about"""
"The author grew up in Long Beach, California. He used to collect tree branches and tools to make bows and arrows. He says he feels more alien the longer he stays in the U.S. He now lives in New York and works in Washington, DC."
"""I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own,"" he says. ""I was really sorry, and I will be more careful with open fire from now on"" ""The most effective bow for me would be like this. Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw"""

"In 1992, the number of people on the Forbes 400 list was 1.7 billion. Today, that number has more than doubled to 2.4 billion. The world's population is growing at a faster rate than the rate of economic growth."
"Income inequality is a global problem, says Simon Tisdall. He says it's a result of political and economic factors, not just crony capitalism. The U.S. has the highest level of income inequality in the world, he says, and it's rising."
"Globalization and the technology revolution are also powering the rise of the super-rich. David Karp, the 26-year-old founder of Tumblr recently sold his company to Yahoo for 1.1 billion dollars. We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies like Sweden, Finland and Germany."
LZ Granderson: I'm a big fan of the Internet. He says it's a great way to connect with people. Granderson says it can also be a good way to make a difference in people's lives. He argues that it can be used to improve the quality of life.
"As income inequality increases, social mobility decreases. The plutocracy may be a meritocracy, but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race. The same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs."
"The 0.1 percent in the U.S. employed hundreds of thousands, Facebook fewer than 10,000. Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment. That means that our countries are getting richer, our companies are getting more efficient, but we're not creating more jobs. The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity."
"Before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society, we had to go through two depressions, the Great Depression of the 1930s. We also, not coincidentally, went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions. We need a new New Deal."

" consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis, digestion, mitosis -- you know all the biological phenomena. Once you accept that, most, though not all, of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate. It's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was, but I'll get to that."
" consciousness is a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we're conscious. consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness. Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition. Maybe consciousness exists, but it can't make any difference to the world."
"The distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are. All of our conscious states, without exception, are caused by lower-level neurobiological processes in the brain, and they are realized in thebrain as higher-level or system features."
" consciousness is real and irreducible. You cannot get rid of it by showing that it's an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions. Since we don't know how our brains do it, we're not in a position, so far, to build a conscious machine."
" consciousness is a digital computer program running in your brain, he says. ""It's really a digital program,"" he says, ""and what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program"" ""We don't need to worry about the hardware. Any hardware will do provided it's rich enough and stable"""
" consciousness creates an observer-independent reality. consciousness creates a reality of money, property, government, marriage, CERN conferences, cocktail parties and summer vacations. Their existence is observer-relative. consciousness is only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings are a university."
 neuroscience is a science where you make objectively true claims about a domain whose existence is subjective. The objection that you can't have an objective science of consciousness because it's subjective and science is objective is a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity. The distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior is important.
" Consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon. It is as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology, or, for that matter, the rest of science. The reason that it's proved very successful is it's private, it's anonymous and it's cheap."
"In the U.S., trust in banks is at an all-time low, according to a Gallup survey. People are actually trusting businesspeople more than they're trusting governments. In that context, networks like Bitcoin suddenly start to make a bit more sense."

"Eleanor was diagnosed with schizophrenia after hearing a voice in her head. The voice told her she had low self-worth, anxiety and fears about the future. She was referred to a psychiatrist who interpreted everything she said through a lens of latent insanity. The voices became increasingly hostile and menacing."
"Eleanor's mental health status had been a catalyst for discrimination, verbal abuse, and physical and sexual assault. She was so tormented by the voices that she attempted to drill a hole in her head in order to get them out. Eleanor says her voices were not her enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems."
"The voices were closely related to aspects of myself, and carried overwhelming emotions. The most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly. The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it, and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile voices were the parts that needed the greatest compassion."
"The International Hearing Voices Movement was founded by Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher. The movement locates voice hearing as a survival strategy, a sane reaction to insane circumstances, not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured. In the last 20 years the movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents."

"During a two-hour race, each car will be sending 750 million numbers. That's twice as many numbers as each of us speaks in a lifetime. It's not enough just to have data and measure it. You need to be able to do something with it."
The data was taken from the bedside instruments of children in intensive care at Birmingham Children's Hospital. The data was streamed to a computer in the hospital using normal 3G telephony. It was then used to tease out the patterns in the data in real time so we could see what was happening.
The data is being used to help doctors and nurses predict when a child is in danger of cardiac arrest. The data will be used to improve care for children with heart and breathing problems. The project is funded by the National Institutes of Health and the European Commission.

"Dan Cohen: Why do we try to convince other people to believe things they don't want to believe, and is that even a nice thing to do? Cohen: There are three models for arguments. The first model -- let's call it the dialectical model -- is we think of arguments as war; you know what that's like. Cohen: Think of a mathematician's argument."
"Philosopher Philippe Cousteau: Argument as war is the dominant model of argument. But arguments are also performances in front of juries, he says. ""I like to think that I'm actually pretty good at arguing,"" he says of his debating skills."
"The war metaphor has, I think, deforming effects on how we argue. It elevates tactics over substance. It magnifies the us-versus-them aspect of it. And finally -- this is really the worst thing -- arguments don't seem to get us anywhere."
"If argument is war, then there's an implicit equation of learning with losing, he says. ""I've gotten better at arguing. I have a new belief. And it's not just any belief; it's well-articulated, examined"""
"The argument-as-war metaphor is just ... it's a monster. It's just taken up habitation in our mind, and there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it. What we need is new exit strategies for arguments. We need to think of new kinds of arguments."

"In the years that I gathered data, only one experience came close to being the perfect one. That is, of course, sex. Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level. Not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close."
"The first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time. The first time-of-the-day clock uses something called the dwarf sunflower, which grows to about 12 inches in height. A toothbrush that tastes like candy, and when the taste of candy runs out, you'd know it's time to change your toothbrush."
"The five senses theory is a useful tool in evaluating different experiences in my life. I realize the five senses isn't the only thing that makes life interesting. There's also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor. Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk. Until then, please have fun using theFive senses in your own lives."
"The Akan of people of Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire developed Adinkra symbols 400 years ago. In the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the men pound out a cloth out of a special tree. In South Africa, Ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes."
African designers struggle with all forms of design because they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration.

We stayed there for six years without paying any rent. Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz. It's a very popular museum now, and I created a big monument for the government."
"In 1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa. Over two million people became refugees. They're so poor, and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season. In the shelters built by the U.N., they were just providing a plastic sheet, and the refugees had to cut the trees."
"The church was built out of beer crates. It was meant to stay there for three years, but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it. Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake, and we proposed to donate this church, so we dismantled them."
"In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake, I went there to use the local material to build a shelter. In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages. And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China, nearly 70,000 people were killed because of the corruption."
"In 1990, Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit, and our former prime minister came, so they helped us to collect money. I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium. In 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake, but it's impossible to fly over. So I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country, to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes."
"The building is made out of paper tubes. It was designed to look like a cathedral. The idea was to make it look like the inside of a church. It's a very small building, but it's very important to the community."
"Sleep disruption in severe mental illness has been largely ignored. New research shows that mental illness and sleep are physically linked within the brain. Sleep disruption in depression, schizophrenia and bipolar is also being studied. The results of a recent study on schizophrenia were quite extraordinary."
Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together. The neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep and give you normal sleep are overlapping. We're beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain. We can think of the sleep centers in the brain as a new therapeutic target.
"Sleep is important for your concentration, attention, decision-making, creativity, social skills, health. If you get sleep, it reduces your mood changes, your stress, your impulsivity, and your tendency to drink and take drugs. An understanding of the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes of mental illness."
"Sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology, and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it's so very important. We use Thomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night, and we occupied the dark, and in the process of this occupation, we've treated sleep as an illness, almost."
Some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state. Sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain. The biological clock tells us when it's good to be up and when it is good to sleep.
"Aristotle suggested that we restore, replace, and rebuild during the night. The energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night, he says. Sleep and memory consolidation is also very important, he adds. But sleep-deprive individuals, the ability to learn that task is smashed."
"If you live to 90, 36 percent of your life will have been spent asleep. A night of sleep is estimated to give us a three-fold advantage. Sleep is not an indulgence. It's not even an upgrade from economy to first class."
The body clock is locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us. The quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor. It's been estimated that 31 percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life.
"When you're tired and you lack sleep, you have poor memory, poor creativity, increased impulsiveness, and overall poor judgment. If you are a tired brain, the brain is craving things to wake it up. Caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across the Western world."
"Sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone. The brain says, ""I need carbohydrates,"" and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars. There's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain."
"Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure. If you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning, if you are taking a long time to get up, or if you're grumpy, chances are you are sleep-deprived."
"Light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light-dark cycle. Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain. Try not to drink caffeine too late in the day, ideally not after lunch."
"Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise, Descartes said. But there is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all, he said. 'Listen to your body. Do you need that much or do you need more?'"
"""I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages. Maths is beautiful. It's natural. It is written in the mathematical language,"" Descartes said. Numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written, he says."
"One is not prime. Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7, but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks, or as we call them, factors. When I say 2 ^ 5, I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other all multiplied together."
"The vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found are of that form: two to a prime number, take away one. A random odd number is a lot harder to test. The world's biggest prime: (2 ^ 31) - 1. It's over two billion."
"In 1876, a mathematician called Lucas proved that (2 ^ 127) - 1 is a prime number. But he didn't know what the factors were. 40 years later, Frank Nelson Cole calculated 67 powers of two. He took away one and wrote that number on the board."
"Frank Nelson Cole delivers the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words. It took him, by his estimate, ""three years of Sundays"" to find the prime factors of (2 ^ 67) - 1. The room went berserk when he wrote down these two large prime numbers."
"Curtis Cooper held the record for the largest ever prime, only to see it snatched away by a rival university. Currently the largest prime number we know, is 2 ^ 57,885,161. If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file, that's 22 meg."
"If written out as a book, this number would run the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again. Large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips. The discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences."
"The CubeStormer II can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube and solve it in five seconds. It's a metaphor for the time in which we live, when human minds and machines can conquer together. It is true, you can now download onto your smartphone an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess."
"Lebanese TV presenter and author Yannick Bourdain organized a marathon to raise money for charity. Bourdain: ""I needed something to take me out of my pain, an objective to look forward to"" Bourdain was inspired by the discovery of the Higgs boson, a particle that gives all particles their mass."
"""When you walk the talk, people believe you,"" says Lina Khatib. ""It was honesty and transparency that brought us together,"" she says. ""For every disaster we had, the marathon found ways to bring people together"""
"The United We Run is a five-kilometer race in Lebanon. It was started in 2005 after the assassination of the country's prime minister. The event has become a platform for peace and unity in the country. It has been attended by over 33,000 people from 85 countries."
"The first annual all-women-and-girls race for empowerment has just taken place. Themes have included runs for the environment, breast cancer, for the love of Lebanon, or just simply to run. The event has become such a respected event in the region that government officials have asked the organization to help them structure a similar event."
"Researchers claim to be able to activate a memory in the brain at the speed of light. They label a memory, and then activate it with a switch. XL: This is way more difficult than, let's say, finding a needle in a haystack."
"The hippocampus is a brain region implicated in processing memories that we hold near and dear. Scientists attached a switch to the cells of the hippocampus to control its activity. The switch was then injected into the brain of mice to activate a memory. The hippocampus is an ideal target to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory, the researchers say."
"Scientists are trying to use light to activate or inactivate brain cells. Light travels at the speed of light, so brain cells would have to respond to a light-sensitive switch. The technique that lets them do that is optogenetics."
"Optogenetics gave us this light switch that we can use to turn brain cells on or off. The name of that switch is channelrhodopsin, seen here as these green dots attached to this brain cell. The memory of that person and the awful, emotional undertones that color in that memory, are largely mediated by separate brain systems."
"Xu: We were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique. The moment we turned on the laser, like you see now, all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode.XL: While watching this, Steve and I are as shocked as the mouse itself."
"Researchers in the U.S. have created a way to control memory using a video clip. They can play back the clip and alter the contents of the memory at any time. The research is called Project Inception and was published in the journal Nature. The researchers are still working with mice, but the results are encouraging."
"Lasers can reactivate a memory using lasers just like they did before. If we present new information and allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory, this will change the memory. XL: These ideas probably remind you of ""Total Recall,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" or of ""Inception"""
Xu Liu: We're living in a time where it's possible to pluck questions from the tree of science fiction and to ground them in experimental reality. XL: One group in our lab was able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory and converted them into a pleasurable memory.
"People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying. But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health. Researchers estimated that 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that Stress is bad for you."
"The experimenter has been trained to harass you during the test. The evaluators are trained to give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback. The experimenter is also trained to make you do the test backwards from 996 in increments of seven. The test is designed to test your ability to count backwards."
"Harvard University study looked at how people's stress response changed when they viewed it as helpful. Participants who viewed their stress response as helpful were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident. In a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up, and your blood vessels constrict like this."
"Stress makes you social, which is good for your health. The hormone oxytocin is involved in the social aspect of stress. It's a neuro-hormone and is released when you hug someone. It can also cause stress-induced heart attacks."
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family. It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts. It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about. Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate.
The body releases the hormone oxytocin when it is under stress. The hormone helps the heart and other parts of the body recover from stress. It also increases the body's ability to fight off infections and other illnesses. It is thought to have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system.
"Researchers found that caring for others did not increase the risk of dying. Caring for others can help you cope with stress, says Dr. Chris Anderson. ""Stress gives us access to our hearts,"" he says. ""When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage"""
"CNN's John Defterios talks to Kelly Wallace about her new book, ""Rewilding"" The book is based on a study of 30,000 adults in the U.S. who were asked how much stress they'd experienced in the last year. Wallace: ""Go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself"""
"Wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995. The number of songbirds, of migratory birds, started to increase greatly. The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park, the places where they could be trapped most easily. The height of the trees quintupled in just six years."
"Wolves have changed the landscape of Yellowstone National Park. The number of beavers in the area has also increased. The effect has been seen in the riverbeds, which have become more stable. The park is now home to more than 100 species of wildlife."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at the role of whales in changing the environment. He says they are responsible for sequestering tens of millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere. Defterio: ""They make, in my view, a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species"""

"Local Projects is a media design firm that works with museums and public spaces. Their latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art, which they've created an engagement called Gallery One for. The entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself, says Jake Barton."
"An algorithm allows you to browse the actual museum's collection using facial recognition. You can actually see all 3,000 artworks all at the same time, and you can actually author your own individual walking tours of the museum. The 9/11 Memorial and Museum will open next year."
"CNN's John Sutter is the founder of StoryCorps, a storytelling platform. Sutter: ""We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating in the third person about an event like that"" ""We need people who are going to make their way through the actual museum itself"""

"The 9/11 Memorial Museum in New York is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. The museum has created an oral history archive of the day's events. The oral histories are mixed with interviews with people like Donald Rumsfeld, Bill Clinton and Rudy Giuliani."
"The memorial is organized into blocks of color with names scrambled for privacy. You can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial. And you can search for an individual name, or in this case an employer, on the memorial itself."

"The malaria parasite transforms itself like that seven times in its life cycle. It can hide in our bodies, undetected, unbeknownst to us, for days, for weeks, for months, for years, in some cases even decades. Only about 12 species of mosquitos carry most of the world's malaria."
"Malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on Earth. If you're poor, you're more likely to live in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained. You're less likely to have door screens or window screens, so you're getting bitten by mosquitos more."
"Malaria poses a huge economic challenge, says Dr. David Perry. The people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least, he says. ""Malaria is a normal problem of life,"" says Perry. ""Why would you write about something so boring, so ordinary?"""
"Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own. A child in Malawi, for example, might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two. That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru discovered the bark of the cinchona tree. Inside that bark was quinine, still an effective cure for malaria to this day."
"The first concerted attack against malaria started in the 1950s. It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department. They knew they had to focus on cheap, easy-to-use tools. But when those tools started to fail, and public opinion started to turn against those tools."
CNN's John Defterios says the fight against malaria is a big challenge. He says the best way to fight the disease is to make it easier for people to get it. Defterio: We need to make sure people don't have to get up in the middle of the night to get a mosquito net.
"Only 20 percent of the bed nets that were first distributed were actually used. The same people who distributed the nets went back and asked the recipients, ""Oh, did you use that net I gave you?"" That's exactly what we did in the 1950s, and that effort backfired."
"Malaria is unconquerable, but what if we attacked this disease according to the priorities of the people who lived with it? This is a question that's personally intrigued me for a long time. I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants visiting my cousins in India every summer. I was made to sleep under this hot, sweaty mosquito net every night."
"James Lyne shows some of the cybercriminals' latest and nastiest creations. He shows how you can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline. James Lyne: If you want your business competitors to go down, well, they can."
"Cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards to manage the distribution of their malicious code. For a small fee, they can upload it and make sure everything is good. You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you how to set up your illegal hacking server."
"Malware is very boring otherwise. We can access your documents, your data. You can turn on the webcam. That can be very embarrassing. Or just to really prove a point, we can launch programs like my personal favorite, the Windows Calculator."
"Computer viruses and trojans are designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars. Let's imagine that our attacker, called Evil Hacker just for comedy value, inserts something a little nasty. The browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs, and up pops fake antivirus."
"A group of hackers we tracked for a year and actually found -- and this is a rare treat in our job. People now pay cybercriminals money to run viruses, which I find utterly bizarre. Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day is a massive challenge, and those numbers are only growing in proportion to my stress line."
"Every second, eight new users are joining the Internet. Today, we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses. Using the email address, the telephone number and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling."
"Cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well. Our friends, our families and our colleagues can break our security even when we do the right things. We will see 30,000 new infected websites. By the end of the investigation, we had photos of the cybercriminals."

"Bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it. They do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note C. Humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history, mostly to harvest their honey."
"More than one third of the world's crop production is dependent on bee pollination. Honeybees can be considered a super-organism, where the colony is the organism and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000 individual bee organisms."
"Bees have been in decline in the United States since World War II. They are dying from multiple and interacting causes, says John Sutter. Sutter: ""Bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally. They're out there because they need to eat"""
"After World War II, we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our gardens. Many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival. We stopped planting clover and alfalfa, which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil."
"The neonicontinoids are a new class of insecticides. They move through the plant so that a crop pest, a leaf-eating insect, would get a lethal dose and die. In parts of the world where there are no bees, people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand."
"All of our beautiful wild species of bees are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees. Plant bee-friendly flowers, and don't contaminate these flowers, this bee food, with pesticides. Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns."
"Maria Spivak: We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert. She says when bees have access to good nutrition, they're better able to engage their own natural defenses. ""Let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large-scale change,"" she says."
"The TED Talk graph shows the global impact of TED Talk ideas. The top 25 percent of TED Talks have a global impact, from New York to New Zealand. The graph is based on the idea of a ""meme-ome"" - a collection of ideas that are connected."
"Every node is a talk, they're linked if they share similar ideas. The structure starts to emerge where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world."
"EB: You cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on YouTube. EB: How do we bubble stuff up to the surface that's maybe really creative and interesting? EB: Well, we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that."
"Sean Gourley: We took 24,000 TEDx Talks from around the world, 147 different countries. We wanted to find the mathematical structures that underly the ideas behind them. We're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique and creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields."
"We've got ourselves in a world that's massively complex, and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it. And we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other. And so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff, you need a lot of data. So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube."
"Growing leather is technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat. Growing leather is a gateway material, a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry. If we can succeed here, it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon."
"This is real, genuine leather, without the sacrifice. It can be grown in the shape of a wallet, a handbag or a car seat. Because we make this material, we can control its properties in very interesting ways. This piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick."
"The future of animal products could be much more like this. We can mimic nature, but in some ways also improve upon it. We have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years. Perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind."
"TED speaker: We need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved. Animals are not just raw materials. They're living beings, and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land, fresh water and greenhouse gases. We can create a global parliament of mayors."
" Democracy is in trouble, no question about that, and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded. Cities are not only the oldest of institutions, they're the most enduring. They are the places where we are born, grow up, are educated, work, marry, pray, play, and in time, die."
"More than three out of four people live in urban institutions, urban places, in cities today. There are scores of international, inter-city, cross-border institutions in which cities are already working together to deal with climate change. Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers."
"Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said, we could never get away here in Philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in Washington. Their job is to get things done, and if they don't, they're out of a job. There isn't a left or a right way of doing."
"Mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers. They get things done. They are also what I like to call homeboys, or to include the women mayors, homies. They're part of the neighborhood. It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor."
"China and the U.S. are locked in all kinds of anger, resentment, and rivalry for number one. That's the difference, and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves. Cities are profoundly multicultural, open, participatory, democratic, able to work with one another."
"The road to global democracy doesn't run through states. It runs through cities. Cities are doing this, but not just one by one. They are sharing what they do, and they are making a difference by shared best practices. Unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization, we will increasingly risk the failure to address transnational problems."

Titus is not the only person to be convicted based on somebody's false memory. In one project in the United States, information has been gathered on 300 innocent people."
"Many people believe that memory works like a recording device. But decades of work in psychology has shown that this just isn't true. Our memories are constructive. They're reconstructive. You can go in there and change it, but so can other people."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how memories can be distorted. He says some people's memories of events in their lives can be altered. Sutter: ""It's not unusual for people to have a memory of something they've never seen before"""
"In one study, researchers planted a false memory that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned and had to be rescued by a life guard. And in a study done in Canada, they planted the false memory of being attacked by a vicious animal, succeeding with about half of their subjects."
Scientists are being sued for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy. The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant. Therapists can't ethically plant false memories in the mind of their patients. There's nothing to stop a parent from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.
"DNA testing can reveal false memories, says Dr. Richard Branson. Branson: ""What we need is a test that says, ""What is x?"" ""Geneticists always say, you always get what you screen for,"" Branson says. ""I know from my work how much fiction is already in there"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his new course, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience. Sutter: ""Education is not about filling buckets; it is lighting fires"" ""It's quite challenging and it's quite interesting, but I have to say, it's not so exhilarating"""
"In a meeting with colleagues, we never talk about what we know, but about what remains to be done. This is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting. That's what was missing. So I thought, well, maybe I should teach a course on ignorance."
"In 2006, there were 1.3 million papers published. Last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published. We all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts, this accumulation model of science, as many have called it, and it seems impregnable."
"Knowing a lot of stuff doesn't make you a scientist, he says. The scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard, cold facts out of the data. The facts are important, but knowing a lot is not the point of science, he adds."
"The circumference of our knowledge grows with knowledge. George Bernard Shaw said that science just creates more questions than it answers. Scientists argue about this all the time, and sometimes we call them bull sessions. We're using it to make better ignorance, to come up with higher-quality ignorance."
"A graph shows the relationship between what you know and how much you know about it. The trend line dips below the zero axis, there, it gets into a negative area. Scientists need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist, but the purpose of knowing a lot is not just to know lots of stuff."
"Neuroscientist: ""The purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions"" ""We love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff"" ""Our technology has actually been pretty good at replicating what the visual system does"""
"We have TV, movies, animation, photography, pattern recognition, all of these sorts of things. They work differently than our visual systems in some cases, but nonetheless we've been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system. What is it that's the most difficult thing for a brain to do?"
"CNN's Jim Boulden asks: How can we tell the difference between a banana and a banana peel? He says the answer is that we can't, and we need to learn how to do it. Bouldens: We need to find out how to make the difference in our lives."
"In second grade, all the kids are interested in science, the girls and the boys. But by 11th or 12th grade, fewer than 10 percent of them have any interest in science whatsoever. ""We just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats and then they puke it up on an exam"""
"CNN's John Sutter asks: Were our ancestors on the verge of mental retardation? Sutter: The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves in ordinary people. He says the aristocracy was convinced that the average person couldn't make it, that they could never share their mindset or cognitive abilities."
"LZ Granderson: If a Martian came down to Earth and found a ruined civilization, he would be baffled. LZ: How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree? He says the answer is that it's down to the quality of the equipment."
"In 1900, people had only had, as people had in 1900, about four years of schooling. Luria: We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world. And our minds have altered, too."
"In the last 50 years, the role of the state has changed dramatically. The role of government has changed from being in charge of the economy to being a facilitator of change. In the past, the state's role was to make sure that the economy was growing. Now, it's more about making sure the economy is growing, not just making money."
"In 1900, only three percent of Americans were in a cognitively demanding job. Today, 35% of Americans are in a job that requires them to think about the world in terms of abstractions. The world has changed a lot since 1900, and so has the way we think."
"Ilyse Hogue: I'm primarily a moral philosopher. I merely have a holiday in psychology, and what interests me in general is moral debate. My father was born in 1885, and he was mildly racially biased. He hated the English so much he didn't have much emotion for anyone else."
"Without the hypothetical, it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground, he says. ""You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them,"" he adds. ""They're just inherited mores. They would not take the hypothetical seriously"""
"We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented. In 1900, people could do simple analogies. By 2010, college graduates, if you said two circles followed by a semicircle, two sixteens followed by what, they would say eight."
"If you score the people a century ago against modern norms, they would have an average I.Q. of 70. The people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses. Young Americans read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands."
"In our real lives, we seek to place trust in a differentiated way. I might, for example, say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher to teach the reception class to read, but in no way to drive the school minibus. In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy."
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life. Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim. What matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness. It's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects.
"The aim of rebuilding trust is more trustworthiness. The task is to rebuild trust. The aim is different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people. It is judgment, and simple reaction, attitudes, that don't do adequately here. It's not easy."
"Ilyse Hogue: 'You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust' 'You can't rebuild what other people give you. You have to, I think, be trustworthy' 'We need to think much less about trust, let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis-detected by opinion polls'"
"CNN's Christiane Amanpour talks about why people think trust has declined. Amanpour: ""I'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others"" Amanpour's new book, ""The Power of One,"" is published by Simon & Schuster."
"In the Bible, a young shepherd boy is sent down to fight a giant. He is outfitted head to toe in bronze armor, and he has a sword and a spear. The giant is so terrifying that none of the soldiers want to fight him. So the shepherd picks up five stones and starts to walk down the mountainside."
"David and Goliath has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger. The shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket, puts it in his sling and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes."
"David's sling is faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers. The stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate, which are twice the density of normal stones. The stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling, it's roughly equal to the stopped power of a [45 caliber] handgun."
"David challenges Goliath to a duel on a coastal plain along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now. Goliath is heavy infantry, and his expectation is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman. David has absolutely no expectation. Why would he? He's a shepherd."
"There are a number of odd things in the Bible about Goliath. He doesn't appear to be carrying a sword, and he doesn't seem to be responding to the challenge. There are many theories as to what is going on, but none that make sense."
"The most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly. It is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone. The tumor, as it grows, often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain."
"Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem, says anthropologist. Death is just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead, he says. Every year, thousands of visitors come to Tana Toraja to see this culture of death."
"In the highlands of Sulawesi island in eastern Indonesia, there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process. Until the funeral ceremony, which can be held years after a person's physical death, the deceased is referred to as ""to makala,"" a sick person."
"In Tana Toraja, the most important social moments in people's lives are not weddings or births, but funerals. The sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased, and, by extension, the deceased's family. The funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death."
"Nenet Katcha, the patriarch of her husband's maternal clan, is approaching the age of 100. Her husband's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his presence has meant to their lives. She asks what we can gain from seeing physical death as part of the greater human story."
"Amy Webb is the author of the book ""The End of Life"" She says the way we talk about death is reflective of a larger culture that is afraid of talking about it. Webb: ""It could change the way that we die, but more importantly, it could transform the how we live"""

"CNN.com's Nina dos Santos was asked to fill out a questionnaire about her ideal date. She says she was asked about monetization and fluency in Japanese. But the real failure was that there were plenty of men for her to date, she says. ""True love will find you when you least expect it,"" her grandmother told her."
CNN.com's Kelly Wallace Stromberg has been on a string of bad dates. She decided to bring her laptop with her on all her dates to track the men's bad behavior. She says men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately when they think about sex.

"Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior. It's a liquid that is completely black. And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it, which makes it magnetic. So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field, it would change its appearance."
"The ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic. That means it doesn't mix with the water. At the same time, it tries to maintain its position above the magnet. It creates those amazing-looking structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint."

"The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane. In the middle years of the century, polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated. Since 1970, no human beings have been back to the moon. No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10."
"Silicon Valley admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech. Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame, in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs."
"Less than two percent of the world's energy comes from solar, wind and other renewable sources. The U.S. needs to find a way to make solar energy more affordable. We need to find ways to make renewable energy more widely available."
"Before the Apollo program ended, 24 men flew to the moon. They didn't bring much back: 841 pounds of old rocks. President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets. Here's a question we need to rethink: What should be the role of money and markets in our societies?"
"The more things money can buy, the more affluence, or the lack of it, matters. A market economy is a place where almost everything is up for sale. It's a way of life, in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate."
"Many schools struggle with motivating kids to do well in school. Some have offered cash incentives for good grades or for reading books. In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read. Some people are in favor of this cash incentive."
Heike Moses: I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation. Michael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away. Elizabeth Loftus: Why not try it and do the experiment and measure things? Heike: It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail.
"The two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books. It also led them to read shorter books. But the real question is, what will become of these kids later? Will they have learned that reading is a chore, a form of piecework to be done for pay?"

"phthalmologist: ""We've been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades"" ""We have decades of experience with our NGOs and with our government entities, and there's an awkward reality,"" he says. ""The awkward reality is we're not making fast enough progress"""
"Problems still seem very daunting and very intractable, and any solutions we're achieving are small solutions. We can't make a large-scale impact on these problems. There's simply not enough money to deal with any of these problems at scale using the current model."
"The scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing. Business creates wealth when it meets needs at a profit. That's how all wealth is created. Only business can actually create resources. Other institutions can utilize them to do important work, but only business can create them."
"Business should give more and be more responsible, he says. Business profits when it makes a profit because it can create a solution that is self-sustaining, he adds. But this is not getting us where we need to go, he argues. He says business should take its profit and redeploy it into social problems."
"Conventional wisdom has been that business makes a profit by causing a social problem, he says. That thinking has led to much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business, he adds. ""The more I tried to address them myself, personally, in a few cases, the more I found actually that the reality is the opposite"""
"Reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit. It saves money. It doesn't waste resources. Having a safer working environment actually, and avoiding accidents, makes the business more profitable. Health of employees is something that business should treasure, because that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work."
"There's a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems. This is what I call shared value: addressing a social issue with a business model. Shared value is capitalism, but it's a higher kind of capitalism. It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be."
"""We have to step back and think about how we've understood and pondered the problems,"" he says.

New York City is largely a city without seats. The design of this street is really to maximize the movement of cars moving as quickly as possible. It misses all the other ways that a street is used. The best example of our new approach is in Times Square. We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street.
"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says Times Square is now one of the top 10 retail locations on the planet. De Blasio: ""It doesn't need to be a zero-sum game between moving traffic and creating public space"" De Blasio says the results of the project have been overwhelming."
The project will create a new public space on Grand Avenue in New York City. The project is the first of its kind in the U.S. and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The goal is to create a public space that can be easily accessed by the public.
We've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space. We've created over 50 pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city. New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States.
"We created the first parking-protected bike lane in the United States. Bike volumes have spiked. Injuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, are all down. We've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes, and now you're seeing them pop up all over the country."
"Citi Bike is the largest bike share program in the United States. The average daily ridership on the streets of New York is 36,000 people. Since we've launched the program, three million trips have been taken. People have ridden seven million miles."
"Transportation commissioner: Citi Bike is an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around. New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America, the slowest bus speeds, he says. ""It's possible to change your streets quickly, it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits,"" he adds."
Both states feared the Soviet Union and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq. Israel's security was best achieved by creating alliances with the non-Arab states in the region. Israel helped Iran by selling it arms and providing it with spare parts for Iran's weaponry.
"In the 1980s, Israel and Iran saw each other as potential security partners. But in the 1990s, the U.S. began to see Iran as a threat to its own security. The two countries have been at odds ever since."
"Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon, only a few decades old in a history of 2,500 years. The ebbs and flows of hostility have not shifted with ideological zeal, but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape. When Iran's ideological impulses collided with its strategic interests, the strategic interests always prevailed."
"Iran is the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside of Israel itself. The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people throughout history have been quite positive. A third of the Jewish population stayed in Babylonia. They're today's Iranian Jews, still 25,000 of them."
"In the U.S., children are shooting other children with guns, says Dr. Gary Sick. Sick: ""I wasn't aware of any problems in America. In fact -- seriously. I would visit friends of mine, and I noticed that they had water that came right into their homes"" Sick: It reminded me of ancient epidemics that were misunderstood because the science hadn't been there."
"The problem of violence was stuck, and this has historically been the case in many other issues. And I'd heard this before as well. It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like, but there was a sense that we would have to do something."
"The greatest predictor of a case of violence is a preceding cases of violence. Violence is, in a way, behaving like a contagious disease. In order to interrupt transmission, you need to detect and find first cases. In this case, it's someone who's very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend."
"Violence interruptors are trained in persuasion, cooling people down, buying time, reframing. Outreach workers are trained to keep people in a way on therapy for six to 24 months. The Economist in 2009 said this is ""the approach that will come to prominence"""
The Interrupters are a group of journalists based in the U.S. and Europe. They have been covering the Ebola outbreak in West Africa for the past two years. The group's website is: http://www.interrupters.org/.
"The U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed not only the approach but the specific model. The theory, in a way, is kind of being validated by the treatment. It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with playgrounds or parks."
"Twitter's John Sutter: ""We are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation"" Sutter says we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium. He says the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces."
"The New Yorker started a fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created. Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account. Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called ""Evidence"" that was originally written with Twitter in mind."
"CNN's Jarrett Bellini talks about Twitter's role as a storytelling tool. Bellini: ""West Wing"" and ""Invisible Obama"" are examples of how Twitter can be used to tell a story. He says Twitter can also be used as a way to engage with the real world."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about a Twitter parody account that became a book. The account followed the daily activities of the U.S. presidential race. Author Dan Sinker turned the account into a narrative book. Sutter: ""I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea"""
"RealTimeWWII documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail. Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news. In both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content."
"Many people in the emerging markets believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point. Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia, said these words in 1775. He could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with American generations."
"China's economic performance over the past 30 years has been quite significant. China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct. People in the emerging markets look at China's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout. In a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed, Africans in 10 countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things."
"In the past hundred years, the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the U.S. to new levels of economic development. In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile, have shown that actually, it's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy."
"The West can either compete or cooperate with China, says Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: If the West decides to compete, it will create a wider schism. He says the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions."
"CNN's Richard Quest was born and raised in Zambia, where blacks were not issued birth certificates until 1973. Quest: ""The question before us, and the question before seven billion people on the planet is, how can we create prosperity?"" He says the Western model speaks for itself."
"In the '70s, the typical American family spent one tenth of their income on transportation. Since then, we've doubled the number of roads in America, and we now spend one fifth of our income on transport. Working families in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing, slightly more."
"In the 1970s, the city of Portland, Oregon, began investing in bike paths. The number of people driving in the U.S. has fallen since then. The city has also seen a rise in the number of young people moving to the area."
"In the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese, and a second third of the population is overweight. Inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no such thing as a useful walk, is driving our weight up."
"Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma, three times what it was in the '90s. American pollution does not come from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes. 12 people out of every 100,000 die every year from car crashes."
"The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti-city movement from Jefferson on. Cities are pestilential to the health, to the liberties and to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities, we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe."
"The average U.S. resident is consuming gasoline at a rate not seen since the '20s. Canadian cities consume half the gasoline of American cities. ""We're all trying to be green the wrong way,"" he says. ""I think we're one of many people who believes that"""
"Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a ""lifestyle choice"" The Mercer Survey ranks hundreds of nations worldwide according to quality of life. Honolulu, number 28, is followed by Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt, the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta are not appearing on the list."
"Sustainability may not be a direct function of our health, says John Sutter. Sutter: ""We are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway"" He says the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life."
"With no elevators, the tower is like a 45-story walkup. Designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven't had any education in architecture or design. The inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands, and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride."
"Makoko is a slum in Nigeria where 150,000 people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops. Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self-built wells throughout the area."
"The city of Cairo is home to more than 100,000 people. The city is also home to a large number of homeless people. Many of the homeless people live in the city's slums. They live in makeshift homes built on the site of a former church."
"Despite limited access to space and money, the homes in the area are designed with care and detail. Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously, putting a lot of work and care into the details. Despite this elaborate decor, sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways."
"The Torre David is an informal city in the Brazilian city of Recife. It was built by people who are disadvantaged and without the support of the government. The city is a remarkable example of how people can make the most of their circumstances. The project is the work of Zita Cobb, founder of the Shorefast Foundation."
"It turned out to be a rare, exceedingly aggressive type of kidney cancer. It was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most. And yet, he did not die. Mysteriously, he lived on. He coached Little League for our son. He built a playhouse for our daughter."
"CNN's John Sutter meets a man dying of cancer for the third time. The man is a Fulbright scholar in China. Sutter: ""There's another drug out there. It's more powerful. Perhaps there's still hope ahead"""
"""We never thought it was the end. We always had hope,"" he says. ""It was the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care"" ""We fought together, we triumphed together,"" he adds. ""We never got to say goodbye"""
"Up until days before his death, I felt strongly and powerfully, that I could keep him from dying ever. Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope. The medical professionals too, you out there, you're in denial too. You want to help."
"Terence Moore's oncologist told him ""better days are just ahead"" before he died. Moore: ""You just redefine denial and hope, and it becomes a feature of being human"" Moore: Giving up the fight meant giving up not only his life but also our story."
"Dying is seen as failing, but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go. Maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye. Terence loved poetry, and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets. This is a poem about Mark Antony, the conquering hero."
"The poet tells him how to say a noble goodbye, a goodbye that's fit for a hero. The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial. It's part of our DNA as humans, and maybe it's time our system -- doctors, patients, insurance companies -- started accounting for the power of that hope."
"In the past 10 years, computers' ability to recognize people in photos has improved by three orders of magnitude. We can start from an anonymous face, offline or online, and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data. We even developed an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to the cloud."
"A future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or, one day, their contact lenses, and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you. In fact, we didn't develop the app to make it available, just as a proof of concept."
"Marketers can use social media to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. We reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before, and so much information about us is being collected by organizations. So next time you are looking for a certain product, and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it, it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends."
"In principle, that's a very good thing, but it is not sufficient. Transparency can be misdirected. You can tell people what you are going to do, and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information. There are complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy."
"In the last 20 years, researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy-preserving manner. We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient, not even the NSA. In other words, we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy."
"Marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them, but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. But in fact, in a few years, organizations will know so much about us, they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them."

"Sustainable products can be beautiful or ugly, sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive, functional or useless. The LED is the next best thing to daylight.

"""We will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves. We will go all in,"" he says. ""It's not just about products in people's homes. We've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products"" ""We can and will go zero waste,"" he adds."
"Cotton is dirty in production. It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer and lots of water. We've worked with others, with other businesses and NGOs, on the Better Cotton Initiative. We're going all-in. By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton."
"By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. We've installed 300,000 solar panels so far, and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate in six countries. We're going 100 percent renewable."
IKEA has 80 auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights. IKEA is working with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights. Many businesses now have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains.
"IKEA has launched a women's open network this week in IKEA. 47 percent are women today, but it's not enough, says CEO. ""We want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management,"" he says."
"We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees. We need CO2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down. It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively. The West has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub-Saharan debt."
"Per capita incomes since the year 2000 have doubled, and this boom is impacting on everyone. When public sector debt is low, governments don't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe. If there's any continent that can do what China has done -- China's at about 130 percent of GDP -- it'll be Africa in the next 30 years."
"The number of 15- to 24-year-olds in various parts of the world is getting bigger. Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now. It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia. And they're investing in telecoms, shopping malls."
"In 1975, just nine percent of kids were in secondary school in sub-Saharan Africa. Today, sub-Sahara is at the levels that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975. And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent: 600,000 less people a year are getting HIV."
"Most Africans are now living in democracies. Democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education. Education is helping growth and investment, and that's giving budget revenues. It's a positive, virtuous circle. But I get asked this question, and this particular question makes me quite sad: It's, ""But what about corruption?"""
"Malaria deaths from malaria are down 27 percent, according to the latest World Bank data. People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s. The Economist had a very famous cover, ""The Hopeless Continent,"" in 2000. In 2012, The Economist has a new cover, and what does it show?"
"Growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent. This shouldn't surprise us, because actually, everybody grows. If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year 1 A.D., there was about 1,800 years where there wasn't an awful lot of growth."
Africa will go from a $2 trillion economy today to a $29 trillion economy by 2050. Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years. The population's going to double from one billion to two billion. Household incomes are going to rise sevenfold in the next 35 years.
You can go and buy some of the great tunes. My iPod's full of them. Buy African products. Go on holiday and see for yourself the change that's happening. It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland. It's just a matter of when the inevitable happens.
"This year is the centennial of Proust's masterpiece, ""In Search of Lost Time"" The novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration, he says. Jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States."
"Jealousy is a hungry emotion. It must be fed. Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood. Every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his ""collection of instruments in his private torture chamber"""
"Proust links the language of scholarship and jealousy. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case. Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd. Grief, humiliation, loss: These were the avenues to wisdom for ProuSt."
"The more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself."
"The author of ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" says jealousy muddles our minds. ""We live in jealous times. Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do"""
"In ""The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"" once Holmes comes in, Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says, ""We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you."" It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries."
"Last year, on the Fourth of July, experiments at the Large Hadron Collider discovered the Higgs boson. The Higgs is the only elementary particles in nature, even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far. We will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe, says Proust."
"The LHC has conclusively proved that this substance is real, because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of. According to the laws of quantum mechanics, it is possible to have transitions between two states, even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states. Besides the known Higgs state, there could be a second state."
"The intensity of the Higgs field is critical for the structure of matter. A bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling. The bubble would then expand at the speed of light, invading all space. If space-time were filled by this HiggsState, all atomic matter would collapse."
"The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that will eventually collapse. It is not likely to happen for at least the next 10 to the 100 years. The Higgs boson does not share the beauty, the symmetry, of the rest of the elementary particles."
"Higgs boson mass could be around the critical value, near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field. This may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach, the multiverse. We think that this these ""why"" questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature."
"In 2015, the LHC will almost double the energy of the colliding protons. This will allow us to explore further the particle world, and we will certainly learn much more. It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions."
"The project is the first of its kind to be built in the city of Tunis, Tunisia. It is designed to be self-sufficient in terms of energy use. The idea came from the patterns of the women's dresses used in the project."
Ethiopian and Tunisian projects are in emerging countries. Both projects have a common approach in the design process. The different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture. The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments.
"Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa is home to a number of large shopping malls. Many of the buildings are empty because people cannot afford to buy things. The self as we once knew it no longer exists, and I think that an abstract, digital universe has become part of our identity."
"The author says the story of our life is based on direct experience, but it's embellished. The overall time that we have for our narrative, our lifespan, has been increasing, but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk, he says."
"Time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one. With no distinction left between the past, the present and the future, we are left with this moment everywhere. This digital now is not the present, because it's always a few seconds ahead."
"Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else. Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose. For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does."
"Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core, says author. We are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget, even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable. We want to clutch, and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments."
"The present is a moment in time that cannot be stored. The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one. The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, it threatens the completeness of ourselves."
"CNN's Jim Boulden says we can choose to take time out of our lives to reflect on the world around us. He says a group of women in their 70s and 80s have returned to the site of the Chernobyl disaster. They are the last of their kind, he says."
Many of the survivors of the Chernobyl disaster are still living in the area. They were forced to leave the area by the Nazis in the '40s. The women say they are not afraid of the radiation that has contaminated their land. They say it is better than being stuck in a high-rise.
"Chernobyl is full of life. Wild boar, lynx, moose have returned to the region in force. The benefits of hardy, physical living, but an environment made toxic by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation."
"The women have lived in the Chernobyl exclusion zone for 27 years. They have outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation, by some estimates up to 10 years. The women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets. The power of motherland seems palliative."
"The Bureau of Labor Statistics says sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country. The weight takes a long time to get used to and the smell is prevalent, but it's not as prevalent as you think. ""It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education,"" he says."
"Truck drivers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city. They are the first guardians of public health. If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively, it starts to spill out of its containments. The dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the role of sanitation workers in cities. Sutter: ""Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical. They wear a uniform in many cities"" ""They are almost a form of reassurance. The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves"""
"Municipal waste accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream. The Department of Sanitation cleans up after us to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage every day. Next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them."
"In the past six years anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people have lost their lives in drug-related violence. This is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy at the cost of thousands of lives."
"The U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world, accounting for more than half of global demand. The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users of illegal drugs in the United States. The only way to do this, because it's illegal, is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs."
"The Mexican drug cartel has been in operation since the 1980s. The cartel is made up of a number of criminal groups, including the Los Zetas. The group was created to take control of the drug trade in the Gulf of Mexico."
"The Zetas focus most of their recruiting on the army, and they openly advertise for better salaries, better benefits, better promotion paths. The Knights Templar emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Ztas into the state of Michoacán. The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state."
"The Sinaloa Federation is the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations. They control all of Michoacán, and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas. The way they control their operations is through family ties. They protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model."
"The problem of spinal cord injury is that the brain and spinal cord are in a non-functioning state. The problem is that we don't know how to fix this, so we rely on the use of force. The solution is to use the spinal cord as a tool for healing, not as a weapon."
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a project to help people with spinal cord injuries. He says the problem is that the brain doesn't know how to respond to pain. Defterio: ""We need to make sure that we don't lose the ability to feel pain"""
"""The Man of Steel"" has raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people. The robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs. ""The robot is transparent, just like you would hold a child during the first steps,"" he says."
"The first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to permanent paralysis. ""It took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal,"" says Dr. Michael Bociurkiw. ""I can promise you this was such an emotional moment"""
"Researchers found a 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain stem. They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA. This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury, but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve quality of life."
"Researchers are working to create a ""personalized neuroprosthesis"" The goal is to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord. The U.S. is treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies, he says."
"Some are blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry, he says. But that's not going to really change the situation, he adds. The solution is open source systems, he writes. ""By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance"""
The NSA data center in Utah is due to be opened very soon. It will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. The electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. The U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners.
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the importance of the PRISM revelations. Sutter: ""Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already, because we did not know this already"" ""I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine,"" Sutter says."
"U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control."
"The first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers. They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers, including Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on."
"Sweden has a similar law to the U.S. when it comes to intercepting data. ""It's not balanced by any means, not even close,"" says CNN's John Defterios. ""How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services?"""
"U.S. intelligence agencies are running surveillance programs against the rest of the world, says Peter Bergen. Bergen: Are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them? He asks: Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion just because there are terrorists?"
"""I have nothing to hide. I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal,"" he says. ""If we indeed need a Big Brother, I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother"" ""Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use,"" he adds."
The president of Brazil was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And surveillance changes history.
"If you look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers, you'll see the numbers buried inside of them. Six is two times three, 15 is three times five, 40 is five times eight, two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate? Of course."
"The area of a rectangle is the sum of the areas of the squares inside it. The area is equal to its height times its base, and the height is clearly eight. The base is five plus eight, which is the next Fibonacci number, 13, so the area is also eight times 13."
"Mathematicians spend lots of time learning about calculation, but let's not forget about application. Mathematics is not just solving for x, it's also figuring out why. Leonardo of Pisa taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today. The Fibonacci numbers can be appreciated in many different ways."
"After brain surgery in 2009, the former cyclist's sight started to fail. Within six months, he had returned to work and was riding a tandem bike with his old cycling buddies. He says he is grateful that his son still has his dad, despite losing his sight."
"""I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me"" ""I was also surprised by the city's propensity for kindness as opposed to indifference or worse"" ""It's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you"" ""You can even follow your nose"""
"When you're sighted, everybody kind of sticks to themselves, you mind your own business. Lose your sight, though, and it's a whole other story. ""I don't know who's watching who, but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me"""
"""I was blessed every block of the way. Bless you, man. Go for it, brother"" "" Disability is an equal-opportunity provider"" ""I think it's pretty cool. It illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic, social, racial, economic lines"""
"The blind should be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities, he says. ""It's a different way of thinking about it, but I think it's kind of beautiful, because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versu-the-disabled"""
"By 2030, three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18. Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates. It is the story of the disenfranchised, unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg and London."
"In Somalia, 70 percent of young people don't work, don't go to school. ""If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, the story of cities 2.0 will be the same"" ""I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking, what if I had never left? Would I have become a terrorist?"""
Mogadishu has been hit hard by the drought. The city is struggling to find a way out of the crisis. One solution is to build a motorbike network. The network will help people get around the city. It will also help the city's economy.
"Until recently, if you wanted flowers at your wedding, you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. Mohamed saw an opportunity. He started a landscaping and design floral company. He's now working on creating Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years."
"Young people need capital to make their ideas a reality, says Mohamed. He says the Peace Park will transform the way people see their city. ""It's more than just starting up a business. It's about creating a social impact,"" he says."
"In the 1970s, when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat, our economy was soaring. In the early 1980s, it cratered quickly. Our banks began to fail. Before the end of the decade, 100 banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma."
"Oklahoma City was once one of the nation's most obese cities. Mayor says the city is now one of America's best places to work and start a business. The city's economy is starting to show some signs of life, he says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his lifelong struggle with obesity. Sutter: ""I was gaining about two or three pounds a year, and then about every 10 years, I'd drop 20 or 30 pounds"" ""I had this huge closet full of clothes, and I could only wear a third of it at any one time"""
"Oklahoma City is 620 square miles, but 15 miles is less than 15 minutes. You literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in Oklahoma City. Land's cheap and developers don't build sidewalks on new developments for a long, long time."
"The mayor of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is trying to get his city on a diet. The city is also building a new central park, 70 acres in size, to be right downtown in Oklahoma City. The mayor is also trying to build a downtown streetcar to help the walkability formula."
"Olympic-caliber events are coming to Oklahoma City. The city is building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks throughout the metro area. ""We're redesigning all of our inner city streets to be more pedestrian-friendly,"" he says."
"""We were on the list as the 22nd fittest city in the United States,"" he says. ""We have a long way to go"" in terms of health care, he adds. ""But we have a lot of good things going for us"""
"Oklahoma City is known as a city of innovation. The city is also known as the birthplace of the video game. The game is called massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling. To play, use three or four thumbs in a node. If you feel ambitious, you can go for it."
"It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you, the player, the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less. It's easier if you stand up. If you have a free thumb, wave it around. Make the node."
"The game is called ""massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling"" The game is played on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. The game takes place over the course of a few hours. The winner gets a special prize for getting all the thumbs in."
"The TED Talk is a one-minute game that challenges people to connect physically with each other. Participants feel joy, relief, love, surprise, pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder, contentment, and creativity in the span of one minute. The best way to release oxytocin is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds."
"According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling, this makes you a grandmaster of the game. The best way to become a legendary grandmaster, you've got your two nodes going on. Pick off the one that looks easiest. Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status."
"The game was invented 10 years ago by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom. As soon as you win, suddenly stop. You go in for the kill. That's how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."
"A drone is a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system. It contains a tiny computer, a compass, a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission, to tell the drone where to go."
"The first ever pictures of orangutan nests have been taken with a drone. The drone can also take pictures of other wildlife, including elephants and turtles. Drones can be programmed to fly to specific locations and land on them. They can also be used to count the number of animals in a given area."
"Drones are being used to monitor deforestation in Indonesia. They can also be used to take 3D images of the area. The images are then used to create a map of the forest. The maps can be used by conservationists to monitor changes in the forest, for example."
Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife. A drone could be flown over the forest and remotely download images from cameras. Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. They transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals.
"The drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes, which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers. It carries a variety of sensors, and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel."
"Carnegie Airborne Observatory images ecosystems in high-resolution 3D. Instrument can measure chemical composition of plants as we fly over them. High-powered lasers fire out of the bottom of the plane, sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second."
"Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees, and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming. Unfortunately, global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector. So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation."
"Scientists have mapped the carbon landscapes of Peru and Panama in high resolution. Red is extremely high carbon stocks, your largest cathedral forests you can imagine, and blue is very low carbon stocks. Most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands, but what you see is the stuff that's up in the mountains."
Climate change is changing the climate of the Amazon rainforest. Droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests. Species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains.
Scientists have used laser-guided spectroscopy to map the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest for the first time. The data will be used to help develop conservation plans for the region. It will also reveal where species may migrate to and migrate from as climate shifts.
Much of Africa's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen. This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management. Some of their decisions have really big impacts. How much and where to use fire as a management tool? Or how to deal with a large species like elephants.
"Sarge Salman became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40. He became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. Salman: ""I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet"""

"He says he would have been treated like a vegetable 100 years ago. He says his goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible. ""With the help of people like you, we can make this dream a reality,"" he says."
The network uses three key technologies. The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles. The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of. And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network. It's a network for a transportation of matter that we call Matternet.
Vehicles use GPS and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations. The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground. The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network. It monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles.
"The cost to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle is just 24 cents. The cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, 85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season."
"It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer, with very low infrastructure investment, very low ecological footprint. China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years. It's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint, operating in the background 24/7, just like the Internet."
"""We would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions,"" he says. ""It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics"" ""We do need to engage, though, in social fiction to make it happen,"" he adds. ""There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier"""
"Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned as primitive and miserable, but also romanticized as happy and peaceful. Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives, although materially poorer. Their children are more self-confident, more independent, and more socially skilled than are our children. They think more realistically about dangers than we do."
Older people in traditional societies are still effective at producing food. They are also capable of babysitting their grandchildren. Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies. They remain valuable. And they continue to live in the same hut or near their relatives.
"In traditional societies without writing, older people are the repositories of information. Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S. Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications and hospitals."
"U.S. has more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past. Older people are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge, he says. The slow pace of technological change means that what someone learns as a child is still useful when that person is old."
Older people are increasingly useful as caretakers for their grandchildren. But they are also losing their value as a result of changing world conditions and technology. What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S. today?
"Older people are much better than younger people at supervising, administering, advising, strategizing, teaching, synthesizing, and devising long-term plans. Traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern, big societies."
"People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers. They tend to solve and do well on standardized tests, however important that is. They're able to have high levels of writing ability and reason at high levels. ""I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks, and we're going to take your  working memory out for a ride"""
"TED Talk: ""Working memory allows us to investigate our current experience as we move forward"" ""We need to take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that's about the size of a pea,"" he says."
"Working memory is great for allowing us to communicate. It allows us to make sense of the world around us. But it does have certain limits. We tend to remember about four things. It used to be seven, but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four."
"Working memory is a way of processing what's going on so that we can use it later. We need to process our existence, our life, immediately and repeatedly. We also need to repeat it, and we need to practice it. We negotiate that through strategies."
"phthalmologist: ""We want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge"" ""We are built for images. We need to take advantage of that,"" he says. ""We're going to write it down, and when you get home, pull out those notes"""
"Working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day. Organization helps, so we need to structure what we're doing in ways that make sense. The support may come in asking people questions, giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it."
"Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos, but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos. Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are, so their brains should also be larger than ours. The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy it uses."
"Scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of, but they were wrong. The human brain has the most neurons of any brain, regardless of its size, especially in the cerebral cortex. Scientists thought that all mammalian brains, including the human brain, were made in the same way, with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size."
"Human brain has 86 billion neurons, 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex. 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has, and this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. Human brain is not a large rat brain. A brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight."
"The human brain may be remarkable, yes, but it is not special in its number of neurons. The human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. The relative cost of our brain is large, but just because we're primates, not because we are special."
"A primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most 53 billion neurons, but then its body cannot be any bigger than 25 kilos. Gorillas and orangutans, for instance, afford about 30 billion neurons. Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate."
"The human brain has the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth. This allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut, which makes them yield much more energy."
"If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes, larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains. The larger the brain, the more cognitively able its owner should be. So it is not happiness that makes us grateful. It's gratefulness that make us happy. If you think it's happiness that make you grateful, think again."
"The key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while. We cannot only have grateful experiences. We can be people who live gratefully. Grateful living, that is the thing. By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment."
"The Dalai Lama says the key to happiness is to be grateful in every moment. He says we can't be grateful for everything, but we can be thankful for the opportunities we are given. The Dalai Lama: Every moment is a new gift, over and over again."
"All of us want to be happy. But once in a while, something very difficult is given to us. When this difficult thing occurs to us, it's a challenge to rise to that opportunity, and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful. Learning patience, for instance."
"When I was in Africa, I didn't have drinkable water. I put stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet, and every time I turned it on, water. It made me so happy. But after a while, this wears off. You can find whatever works best for you, but you need stop signs in your life."
"""Nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy,"" says the Dalai Lama. ""If you're grateful, you act out of a sense of enough and you are willing to share"" ""There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is,"" he says."
"The future of the world will be a network, not a pyramid turned upside down. Grateful people are joyful people, and joyful people -- the more and more we'll have a joyful world. We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something."
"The social impact bond is a new business model for social change. The idea is to raise money from socially motivated investors. They pay for a set of services, and if those services are successful, then they improve outcomes. With those measured reductions in re-offending, government saves money."
Investors get a return of up to 13 percent on their investment. The government gets a return on its investment of £2.5 million. The money will be used to improve the quality of care given to children in care homes. It will also help to reduce the number of people in care who need to be re-sentenced.
"There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain, and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world. David Cameron's put 20 million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea. Obama has suggested 300 million dollars in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures."
"In Peterborough, the prison service added case management across all of the different organizations working with prisoners. The last element is partnership with the Ministry of Justice. This creates a structure through which they can combine. This leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change."
"phthalmologist says drug testing is too costly, takes too long and fails more often than it succeeds. He says new model could help reduce re-offending by up to 50 per cent. The new drug could also be used to test new drugs on animals."
"We need human cells, but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body. We call it an organ-on-a-chip. Right here in my hand is a breathing, living human lung on a chip. And it's not just beautiful."
"The chip is the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry, the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies. We use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment. We could mimic infection, where we add bacterial cells into the lung."
"Cells from the small airways in our lungs have these hairlike structures. These structures are called cilia, and they actually move the mucus out of the lung. Cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis."
Human cells in a gut on a chip can mimic many of the functions of the human intestine. The technology can also be used to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. The goal is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what's going to happen in humans.
Skin on a chip could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment. It could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism or radiation exposure. Organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials.
"The Wyss Institute is developing an instrument that can link 10 or more organ chips together. The instrument creates an easy user interface, allowing researchers to take a chip and put it in a cartridge. The Wyss institute is also establishing important industry collaborations."
"phthalmologist: We could imagine one day having Geraldine on a chip, having Danielle on aChip, having you on a Chip. The two main tools available at our disposal are cells in dishes and animal testing. ""I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't,"" he says."

"When I became mayor, applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interest, we implemented a mass transit system based on buses in exclusive lanes. We called it TransMilenio, in order to make buses sexier. In fact, buses are not sexy, but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing cities."
"In Bogotá, Colombia, people who walk are third-class citizens while those who go in cars are first- class citizens. In terms of transport infrastructure, what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways but quality sidewalks."
"Protected bicycle ways are a right, just as sidewalks are, he says. More than 10,000 children are killed by cars every year in the world, he adds. In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities which will exist in the year 2060 will be built."
"In 1925, almost 7,000 children were killed by cars in the United States. In Amsterdam, more than 30 percent of the population uses bicycles, despite the fact that the Netherlands has a higher income per capita than the U.S. In new cities which are going to be built, this would not be particularly difficult."
"Cities we are going to build over the next 50 years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future. But unfortunately, reality is not as good as my dreams. Because of private property of land and high land prices, all developing country cities have a large problem of slums."
"For such an enormous industry -- there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea — it's become pretty much invisible. In Singapore, shipping is so present that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel. But elsewhere in the world, if you ask the general public what they know about shipping, you will get a blank face."
"CNN's John Defterios travels around the world with a crew of just 21. He finds the pace of modern shipping is punishing for what he calls ""the human element"" Defterio: ""Most seafarers now have less than two hours in port at a time"""
"The crew of a container ship was held hostage by pirates in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait in the Indian Ocean. The crew was not allowed on deck, and there were double pirate watches. Some seafarers were held hostage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience."
The 15 largest ships pollute as much as all the cars in the world. A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean. The acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to 90 percent. But there are no laws governing acoustic pollution yet.

"The name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the Sandy Glacier. As new snow lands on the glacier, it melts in the summer sun, and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice. They start to melt and bore their way down through the glaciers, forming big networks of caves."
"The cave is formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that's slowly sliding down the mountain. Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down. Warm air from below the mountain actually rises up, gets into the cave, and melts the ceilings back."
"CNN's John Sutter explores a new type of cave in the U.S. state of Oregon. The caves are made of ice, which Sutter and his colleagues used to map the area. Sutter: ""The more I studied caves, the more useful I found all that math"""
"Brent named this cave Pure Imagination, I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined. Scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles, tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions, might be living under the ice."
"Every year, new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before. You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go. The most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it."

"By 2010, Detroit had become the poster child for an American city in crisis. Many people were beginning to write it off, as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities. Between 1950 and 2000, the region grows by 30 percent. But the migration leaves African-Americans in place."
"Detroit is 139 square miles. Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels. Former models can move to Detroit, buy property, start successful businesses and restaurants. Some are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots and start community gardens."
"Detroit is under the control of an emergency manager, and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The city itself wasn't necessarily too large, but the economy was too small. There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit, very different from a Denver or an Atlanta."
"The industrial Internet is a world where machines are self-aware, predictive, reactive and social. Industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors. Increasingly sophisticated analytics then sift through the data, providing insights that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways."
"The Industrial Revolution brought us machines and factories, railways, electricity, air travel, and our lives have never been the same. Today, 10 percent of all flights cancellations and delays are due to unscheduled maintenance events. This results in eight billion dollars in costs for the airline industry globally every year."
"New technology is reducing the time it takes to care for patients, says Dr. Andrew Weisman. He says it is also reducing the cost of health care. Weisman: By 2020, the Internet will account for over 50 percent of all digital information."
"Industrial Internet will make life easier for workers of all skill levels. The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man than the Charlie Chaplin of ""Modern Times"" The new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work."
"The industrial Internet could raise average income by 25 to 40 percent over the next 15 years, boosting growth to rates we haven't seen in a long time. In the U.S. alone, the Internet could add between 10 and 15 trillion dollars to global GDP."
"Technology is beginning to transform industrial sectors that play a huge role in our economy and in our lives.

"There are over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee. The Jaipur Foot Organization was looking for a better knee. This is a knee that's been designed specifically for poor people. It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism."
"D-Rev has developed a knee that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait, for 80 dollars retail. The key is to get this great invention to the people who most need it. D-Rev looked at three things that we really believe get technologies to customers, to users."
"D-Rev's Jaipur Knee has the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market. The knee is designed to be user-centric, not just for the end user, but also for the prosthetist who fits it."
"At the time, the U.S. government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction. We also saw that our users had modified it in other ways. We did a lot of iterations, not just  around this, but some other things."
"D-Rev has fit over 5,000 amputees. The industry average is about 65 percent. Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries. We'll double the impact in 2015, and we'll double it each of the following years after that."
"D-Rev is short for Design Revolution. D-Rev represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users.

Piff: As a person's levels of wealth increase, their feelings of compassion and empathy go down. ""Their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness, and their ideology of self-interest increase"""
"Psychologists have found that wealthier people are more likely to moralize greed being good. In one study, people who made under 15,000 dollars a year gave 44 percent more to a stranger than those who made 150,000, 200,000.

"If you lose a lot of weight, your brain reacts as if you were starving. People who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed. From an evolutionary perspective, your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense. Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point."
Dr. Yoni Freedhoff says changing the food environment is the most effective solution to obesity. He says intuitive eaters spend less time thinking about food. Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising and the all-you-can-eat buffet.
"The healthier the lifestyle, the less likely people were to die during the study. Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range. For obese people with no healthy habits, the risk is very high, seven times higher than the healthiest groups. mindful eating: learning to understand your body's signals."

"At the Archivio di Stato, you have 80 kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of Venice over more than 1,000 years. We are setting up a 10-year digitization program which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system."
"The information system can be searched in many ways. You can ask questions like, ""Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?"" How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market in 1434? What was the salary of a glass maker in Murano maybe over a decade?"
"The project aims to reconstruct a fully documented potential story of Venice's history. The challenge is qualifying, quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of the process. The system should allow for that, because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty, which is new for this type of giant databases."
"The project is part of a larger effort to create a new generation of ""digital humanists"" in the humanities. The aim is to create an immersive system that allows people to dive and reconstruct the Venice of a given year. The project is currently being conducted in Geneva, Switzerland."

"The objects were made by the Sèvres Manufactory, made of porcelain in the late 1750s, and designed by a designer called Jean-Claude Duplessis.

"Luxo is a robot that can communicate with a human. It was designed to help the human in a variety of ways. The robot can also be used as a guide for the human. The project is still in development, but the robot is already in use."
"When humans and robots interact, it's much more like a chess game. The human does a thing, the robot analyzes whatever the human did. The robot decides what to do next, plans it and does it. Then the human waits, until it's their turn again."
"In his PhD thesis, he learned about method acting. He says method acting shows you don't have to plan every muscle in your body. Instead, you have to use your body to find the right movement, he says. ""Our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave,"" he adds."
"Researchers have created a computer model of embodied artificial intelligence. The robot is the same lamp that you saw, and I put two brains in it. It's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony."
"Israeli roboticist says he was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing. He found that people actually loved the adventurous robot. They thought it was more intelligent, more committed, a better member of the team, contributed to the team more."
"""I thought, if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies, maybe I can make the robots jam together like a band"" ""I tried to do the same things, this time with music, where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play, but is still doing it"""
"The head doesn’t actually touch the marimba, it just expresses what the music is like. The robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human, while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing. It's all in the motion, in the timing of how the thing moves."
"The robot is a speaker dock that plays music to a person's phone. The idea came from a teacher who said, ""As an animator, you're not a director -- you're an actor"" The robot is designed to look at people in the periphery of their vision."
"The Arab Spring has changed all that, in uprisings which have blossomed across the region since 2011. Now religion and politics are connected, with the rise of such groups as the Muslim Brotherhood. And some people are starting to ask questions about the role of Islam in public and private life."
"Across the Arab region, the only accepted context for sex is marriage -- approved by your parents, sanctioned by religion and registered by the state. If you don't tie the knot, you can't  move out of your parents' place, and you're not supposed to be having sex. In a patriarchy, boys will be boys."
"Women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve this tiny piece of anatomy. This is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the Arab region. In Egypt, where my research is focused, I have seen plenty of trouble in and out of the citadel."
"Wives in the Middle East are often afraid to have sex with their husbands for fear of being seen as a bad wife. This is despite the fact that sex in the Arab world is still seen as acceptable. The Arab world has a long history of sexual repression, according to a new book."
"Islam has a rich tradition of talking frankly about sex. But in the Arab world, sex is largely unknown. This is part of a wider closing in political, social and cultural thought. In these, as in so many other matters, Islam offers us at least 50 shades of gray."
"Sexual violence is at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa. The region is one of only two regions in the world where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise. The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows, and that is true for us all."
"Women are 70 percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes. Even with this high prevalence, women are misdiagnosed between  30 and 50 percent of the time. The NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law in 1993. It mandated that women and minorities be included in clinical trials."
"Women are now routinely  included in clinical studies. There are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease. What we have learned about these  differences is often overlooked. We are just not doing enough, says Dr. David Perry."
Linda was diagnosed with a rare form of heart disease. She had to have an operation to remove the plaque from her heart. She is now recovering well and her family is happy to have found the cause of her heart disease and the treatment it caused.
"Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of women in the U.S. Women have the tools to make the diagnosis. But for too many women, that's not the case. A landmark study that was published two years ago asked the very important question: What are the most effective treatments in women?"
"Women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men. When women are diagnosed, their survival tends to be better than that of men. Researchers have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor  cells of both women and men."
"Depression is the number one cause of disability in women in the world today. The U.S. has invested billions of dollars in breast cancer research. We can do the same for lung cancer and for every other disease, says Dr. David Frum."

"Education has been calcified for 500 years, we really cannot think about reengineering it, micromanaging it. We really have to completely reimagine it. I really believe that we can transform education, both in quality and scale and access, through technology. I'd like to reimagine education."
"When edX launched its first course, 155,000 students from 162 countries enrolled. This number is bigger than the total number of alumni of MIT in its 150-year history. We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises, online videos."
"Many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world. We are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom, to create a blended model of learning. When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager, she stopped speaking English, and she began speaking this new language."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a group of young people about how they can use technology to improve their lives. Sutter: ""I'm willing to bet that our kids will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs to text"""
"With MOOCs, students can learn online and in person at the same time. The idea is to create a blended model of education to reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom. One of the key ideas is active learning, where students learn in their own homes."
"Students learn much better when they are interacting with the material, he says. Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises, he adds. Students can hit the pause button. They can rewind the professor. Heck, they can even mute the professor, he suggests."
Students can get instant feedback on their work. They can use this feedback to improve their skills and learn more about the world around them. This is a new way of teaching. It's a way of making learning more fun. It is a way to make learning more exciting.
"Fifth is peer learning. You can engage students much like they design with Legos. So here, the learners are building a circuit with Lego-like ease. And this can also be graded by the computer system. The students are learning from each other, and they're telling us that they are learning by teaching."

"40 percent of food purchased for the home in the U.S. is wasted. Half of the world's produced food is wasted, according to the latest U.N. stats. The refrigerator is a serious contributor to this, and one of the features of it is the crisper drawer."
Lettuce is getting thrown out because the crisper drawers are not designed to actually keep things crisp. The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical. We need to design things like this far better if we're going to start addressing serious environmental problems.
"The refrigerator is a sign of modernity, but we haven't really changed the design of them since the 1950s. Forty percent food waste is a major problem. Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that. Another item that I find fascinating is the electric tea kettle, which is really big in the U.K."
"Sixty-five percent of Brits admit to over-filling their kettle when they only need one cup of tea.

"The National Science Foundation funded a project to create custom-crafted voices for people who had lost their voice later in life. The project is called VocaliD, or vocal I.D., for vocal identity. The voice is a combination of the source, which is the vibrations generated by your voice box, and the rest of the vocal tract."
Scientists have developed a way to combine the voice of a person with severe speech disorder to create a new type of voice. The process involves borrowing the filter from a person of the same age and size as the person you want to speak to. The voice is as clear as that of the person we borrow it from.
"The more speech you have, the better sounding voice you're going to have. The idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language. We're using concatenative synthesis, and that's what we're using in this project."
"Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice. For Samantha, her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest, a stranger who gave her the gift of voice. Rupal Patel: That was the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking."
"In the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans who are unable to speak. Professor Hawking uses an American-accented voice. All we need is a few hours of speech from our surrogate talker, and as little as a vowel from our target talker."
Sally Kohn: I noticed a disturbing trend in leadership. She says it was a lack of leadership preparedness. Kohn asks: What makes a great leader? She says we need leaders who are prepared to make tough decisions. She asks: How do we get to that point?
Leadership in the 21st century is defined and evidenced by three questions. Where are you looking to anticipate the next change to your model or your life? Who are you spending time with? What are you reading? And then how are you distilling this into a decision?
"Great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels. They don't just talk about risk-taking, they actually do it. The most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is naïve or reckless."
"CNN's John Sutter has spent 25 years observing what makes great leaders. Sutter: What kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality? Sutter says the standard narrative of human sexual evolution is wrong. The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA, according to Sutter."
"Human sexuality evolved as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex, flexible social systems, networks, that our ancestors were very good at. In a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers. So I'm saying, yes, there were overlapping sexual relationships. But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive."
Darwin was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates. chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day. Humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle.
"The average human has sex about 1,000 times per birth. Humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face-to-face when both of them are alive. The human, chimp and bonobo all have external testicles."
"Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution. The human, some of you will be happy to hear, has the largest, thickest penis of any primate."
"Edward Wilson: Human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation. He says our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world. Wilson: Our fight is with an outdated,  Victorian sense of human sexuality."
"The author says the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories. We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant, he says. He says a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations of human sexuality."
"Ben Franklin believed that government could be built by the people, and we call those people civic hackers. The values that underly a healthy democracy, like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise, are the same values underly the Internet.

"Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. Most of it is made of something very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures."
"Dark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens  when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception."
The universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. The cause of this is called dark energy. How does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Here is a computer simulation to help you understand this. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts of the universe.

"Business strategy is based on the idea that what holds a business together is transaction costs. Since the mid-'90s, communications costs have actually been falling even faster than transaction costs, which is why communication, the Internet, has exploded in such a dramatic fashion."
"In the days of leatherbound books, most of the cost of information was passed on to the reader. In the days before the Internet, this was not the case. The Internet has changed the way information is shared. It is no longer the case that information must be shared equally."
"In 2000, the world's stock of data was growing, indeed growing quite fast. But it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog. By 2007, the data had exploded, and there'd been this massive substitution of digital for analog. About a half of that digital data is information that has an I.P. address. It means it becomes possible to put together half of the world’s knowledge."
"The first human genome, that of James Watson, was mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year 2000. Since then, the costs of mapping the genome have come down. The cost is now below 1,000 dollars, and it's predicted that by 2015 it will be below 100 dollars."
"Technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it. The logic isn't just about big data. If we were to look, for example, at the telecommunications industry, you can tell the same story about fiber optics."
"izontalization of the structure of industries implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy. It means, for example, we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition simultaneously. We need industry structures that will accommodate very, very different motivations, from the amateur motivations of people in communities."
"Gamma International's software allows police to monitor people remotely. The company's managing director has said he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.

Workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused, she says. Breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts."
"Breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival. Real equality means recognizing that the work women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionallydone. ""We don't typically challenge why men's work is advantaged"""
"Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones, because they have a choice about how much they want to work. Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need. Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, provide universal child care."

Males have a spiked, barbed penis that they literally stab into the female, and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina. The sperm migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries."
Sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex. Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings. Sex didn't actually evolve until about 65 million years ago with the advent of mammals.
"Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris, or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally. It's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology. In hyena societies, adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale."
"Penis is a detachable, swimming penis. It finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water, attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm. It's a close relative of squid and octopus, and males have a hectocotylus."
"Psychopaths have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala. The amygdala is an almond-shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain. It is responsible for emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, anxiety and fear of the unknown."
"The more empathic a person is, the larger and more active their amygdala is. It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy. acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up, like learning to speak. By the age of 12 months, most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others."
The early years of a person's life are crucial for brain development. Scientists used to think that no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain. But new research has shown that the brain can grow new cells in a variety of ways.
"In some areas of the brain, more than 20 percent of cells are newly formed. Mice reared in a standard cage have dramatically lower levels of new neurons in the brain. The more stress, the less brain development, which in turn causes higher stress levels."
"The best way to achieve that, even in adults, is to change and modulate our environment. In such a setting, the perpetrator can see, perhaps for the first time, the victim as a real person. Such programs won't work for everyone, but for many, it could be a way to break the frozen sea within."
Writer: We need to change our view of Joe as someone wholly irredeemable. He asks: Will he be among the 70 percent of inmates who end up reoffending? Writer: There is nothing that is definable at the time of birth that would define you as a male or female.
"""I saw someone age 24, genetically female, went through Harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story"" ""I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity,"" he says. ""If you just think of the following, you'll get it right,"" the patient says."
"The rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest in the world. The fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be, with puberty, actually is nullified by the puberty you get."
"""I'm going to show you what it's like to be a boy or a girl,"" he says. ""It's not easy. It's not fun. But it's worth it"" ""You have to do it,"" he adds, ""or you're going to lose your child"""
"Jackie had been abused in the Midlands, in England. She's 12 years old there, she was living as a girl, but she was being beaten up. Jackie, on top of it, was, by virtue of skeletal markings, destined to be six feet five."
"Nicole and brother Jonas are identical twin boys, and proven to be identical. Nicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three. At age seven, they changed her name, and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty."
"There are only 17 states that have an anti-discrimination law against discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodation. Only five of those states are in New England. We need to get this condition out of the DSM. It is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian, and that went out the window."
"The author says reason is just a means to an end, and the end depends on the reasoner's passions. He says reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoners want peace. But it can also lead to conflict and strife if thereasoner delights in conflict."
"Human nature hasn't changed, but we've become more empathetic. Empathy emerges early in life, perhaps before the age of one. Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain that respond to other people's actions the same way they respond to our own. But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress."
"The author of ""The Power of Now"" argues that reason can be used to change the world. He argues that the way we see the world is not the same as how we see ourselves. ""The power of now"" can be applied to all aspects of our lives, not just those in power."
"In 1764, a pamphlet was circulated calling for the punishment of breaking the wheel. The pamphlet was written by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria. The idea that punishment should be proportionate to the harm it will cause is still popular today."
Modern anti-war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war. John Locke argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government. The cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning.
"Mary Astell: If absolute sovereignty is not necessary in a state, how comes it to be so in a family? If all men are born free, how is it that all women are born slaves? Jeremy Bentham: The question is not, can they reason, nor can they talk, but can they suffer?"
The panelists debate the role of reason in society and the moral progress we have made. The panelists also debate the use of religion to justify the unjustifiable. The debate ends with the panelists agreeing that reason is a better angel than reason.
"Global Witness is an 80-strong team of campaigners, investigators, journalists and lawyers. It investigates, we report, to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict. And then we campaign hard to  change the system itself. We're doing this because so many of the countries rich in natural resources are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet."
"Anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes. There are just so many examples, the horesemeat scandal in Europe, the Italian mafia, they've used these companies for decades. Anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the Ukraine."
In some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card. London is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company. In the U.S. you can simply go online and find a company service provider.
You can set up an online company and pay for it to be anonymous. You can add more companies to the list to make it harder to find out who is behind them. But who is the real owner of the company that you are paying to be an anonymous user?
"Over 200 people died when a fire broke out in a Buenos Aires nightclub. The victims' families tried to find out who was responsible. But they found instead anonymous companies, and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved. Why should this secrecy be such an accepted practice?"
"Companies were created to limit financial risk, they were never intended to be used as a moral shield. My wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good. Together let's ignite world opinion, change the law, and launch a new era of openness in business."
"Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue. The U.K. government is already on board; it supports these public registries. But it's early days. America still needs to come on board, as do so many other countries."
"""This is about being on the right side of history,"" he says. ""The Internet is not the enemy. It's a part of our society"" ""I don't think there's any question that some of the most important revelations are yet to come,"" he adds. ""Let's just do it"""
"""Bullrun"" is a program named after a Civil War battle. The reason that they're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure. They're building in backdoors that not only the NSA can exploit, but anyone else who has time and money to research."
"NSA has traditionally prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that American secrets are simply worth more, says Edward Snowden. Snowden: The first open court, the first federal court that's reviewed this, outside the secrecy arrangement, called these programs Orwellian and likely unconstitutional. Congress, who has access to be briefed on these things, has produced bills to reform it."
"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange talks to CNN's John Defterios. Assange says he has been targeted by governments who want to kill him. He says he goes to sleep every morning thinking about what he can do for the American people. Assange: ""The fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process, they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial"""
"Edward Snowden: ""Whatever part I can do to see that end, I'm happy to do despite the risks"" ""I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me"" ""It's not left or right, it's not really about pro-government, libertarian, or not just that"" ""Part of it is almost a generational issue"""
"Snowden: ""This is not a left or right issue. Our basic freedoms, and when I say our, I don't just mean Americans, I mean people around the world, it's not a partisan issue"" ""I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet is exactly what we need,"" Snowden says."
TED founder says we are now watching Big Brother through the power of the web. He argues that government surveillance powers have increased by several orders of magnitude. He says we need to rebalance our privacy rights to make the web accessible to ordinary citizens.
"Timothy Stanley: ""I did this to do what was right, and I'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself"" ""I would say the last year has been a reminder that democracy may die behind closed doors, but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors,"" he says. ""We don't have to give up our privacy to have good government,"" Stanley says."
The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason. We've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm. It's a program through which the government could compel corporate America to do its dirty work for the NSA.
"Snowden: ""These aren't the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be"" Snowden: ""It doesn't mean that there's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the NSA palling around"""
"The biggest thing that an Internet company in America can do today, right now, without consulting with lawyers, is to enable SSL web encryption on every page you visit. The reason this matters is today, if you go to look at a copy of ""1984"" on Amazon.com, the NSA can see a record of that."
" Boundless Informant: More communications are being intercepted in America about Americans than there are in Russia about Russians. The NSA has its own internal data format that tracks both ends of a communication, and if it says, this communication came from America, they can tell Congress how many of those communications they have today."
"Edward Snowden: ""If you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to worry about"" ""Who I am really doesn't matter at all. We have a right to privacy,"" he says. ""We require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion"""
"CNN's John Defterios says the U.S. is in danger of losing control of the internet. He says it's a mistake to think the internet is a free-for-all for the rich and powerful. The Internet is a tool to help the poor, he says, not a weapon for war."
"Chris Hadfield: ""It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things"" ""You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself"" ""It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there's a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space"""
"Ilyse Hogue: I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do. I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me it was just an obvious thing -- I want to somehow turn myself into that. It's an entirely different perspective, you're not looking up at the universe, you and the Earth are going  through the universe together."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the scariest thing he's ever done. Sutter: ""I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind, and I didn't know why"" ""If a brown recluse bites you, you end with one of these horrible, big necrotic things on your leg"""
"The danger is entirely different than the fear. The spider that may come out is  no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly. If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded, your natural reaction would be to panic."
"We practice things going right, so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs. You can fundamentally change  your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you. You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled with a Russian crew on a mission to the ISS. The crew rode a meteorite back to Earth in a simulator before the mission. After the mission, the crew rode the meteorite home in a custom-built Soyuz spacecraft."
 RL: I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons. Metadata is the information that lets you find connections that people are trying to hide. The alternative to that is one that's much less efficient and much more invasive of privacy.
"CNN's John Defterios spoke with the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Defterio: ""We need to have that be a fact-based conversation, and we want to help make that happen"" ""I think this is a really important conversation that we're having in the United States and internationally,"" he said."
"The reason that there hasn't been a major attack in the United States since 9/11, that is not an accident. The chance in the last few years of being killed by terrorism is far less than the chance of being dead by lightning. The other thing I would say is that your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat is not at all far-fetched."
"NSA director: Characterizing Snowden as a whistleblower actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities. He says the programs were authorized by two different presidents, two different political parties, by Congress twice, and by federal judges 16 different times. The NSA provided all the relevant information to our oversight committees, and then the dissemination of that information by the oversight committees throughout Congress."
"The NSA is working on a proposal to publish transparency reports. The agency is heavily biased towards defense. The majority of vulnerabilities that the NSA finds are disclosed to the people responsible for manufacturing or developing those products. ""We eat our own dog food. We use the standards,"" NSA chief says."
"NSA chief: ""There is a strong tradition in American jurisprudence of having discussions with people who have been charged with crimes in order to, if it benefits the government, to get something out of that"" ""There's always room for that kind of discussion,"" he says."
"The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government, and so learn the facts. Don't rely on headlines, don't reliance on one-sided conversations, he says. The NSA has a sign, a badge tab, we wear badges at work with lanyards, and if I could make a plug, my badge lanyard at work says, ""Dallas Cowboys."""
Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director of the National Security Agency. He says Edward Snowden had other avenues for raising his concerns. He also says Snowden's actions put people's lives at risk. Led gett: Snowden showed an amazing arrogance to the idea that he knows better.
"Richard Ledgett: The Internet is used by legitimate foreign intelligence targets. But it's also used by people who are working against us and our allies, he says. ""They're trying to hide from the government's ability to isolate and interdict their actions,"" he adds. ""So we have to swim in that same space"""
"The Internet is viewed as a momentous invention of humanity, kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press, for example. From that lens, what the NSA has done is equivalent to the authorities back in Germany inserting some device into every printing press that would reveal which books people bought."
"The U.S. needs to be more transparent about its surveillance programs, he says. The U.K. and other countries are using the program to counter U.N. spying, he adds. The NSA is trying to make the world more aware of its surveillance program, he argues."
" RL: We didn't realize that he was going to show up there, so kudos to you guys for arranging a nice surprise like that. RL: I think absolutely, folks do have a right to privacy, and that we work very hard to make sure that that right is protected."
"Google's Larry Page says automated cars could be used to separate bikes from traffic. He says Google is trying to get people to use bikes more. The company has been working on the idea for 15 years, but it's not done, he says."
"Loon's founder says the more he learns about technology, the less he knows about it. Loon is trying to do things that people might not think are possible, he says. ""I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that,"" Loon says."
"""We need revolutionary change, not incremental change,"" he says. ""I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil,"" he adds. ""We have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy"" ""You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better"" ""I think we aim to do kind of similar things."
"LP: I think the most important thing -- I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong? And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I try to focus on that and say, what is that future really going to be and how do we create it?"
"Larry Page: ""It's still very, very clunky. That was a good thing to be working on"" ""I felt guilty about spending time on that. And I felt like that was stupid,"" Page says of Google's search engine. ""It doesn't really understand you,"" he adds."
"Deep Mind is learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games, and really just, maybe I can show the video, just playing video games and learning how to do that automatically. LP: The amazing thing about this is this is, I mean, obviously, these are old games, but the system just sees what you see, the pixels."
"Computer scientist Demis Lerman: ""I think for me, this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time"" ""This is the state of the art right now, understanding cats on YouTube and things like that, improving voice recognition,"" Lerman says."
Zack Matere and Charlie Rose search the Internet for information. Matere finds a video of a cat that shows how computers can understand people. Rose finds a way to use the Internet to help people in need. The pair then use the technology to help others in need of help.
"CNN's Cevallos talks to the founder of the Loon Project, a project to give people access to the Internet. The project is using balloons to send information to people around the world. Loon is a project that aims to help people in need by giving them access to information and technology."

"The Artemia swarm manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming conspicuous colored swarms. The shrimp are just one step on its journey. The ultimate destination is this, the greater flamingo. Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce, so to get there, it manipulates hosts."
"CNN's Jim Boulden writes about the fascinating world of insects. He says they are part of a larger group of creatures that control the human mind. They are called ""parasites"" for their ability to control the mind of their hosts. Bouldens: ""Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations"""
A parasitic wasp attacked a caterpillar and laid eggs inside it. The eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body. Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults.
"Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon. The wasp basically un-checks the escape-from-danger box in the roach's operating system, allowing her to lead her helpless victim back to her lair by its antennae."
"CNN's John Sutter asks if there are dark, sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior. Sutter: Parasites have as much control over their own fates as my car. The prospect of losing those qualities to forces unseen informs many of our deepest societal fears."
"Toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine, a substance involved in reward and motivation. If the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss, it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away. How those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear."
" Estimates suggest that one in three people around the world have Toxo in their brains. The parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long period of time. Experts are divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior. But given the widespread nature of such manipulations, it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren't affected."
"CNN's John Defterios says autonomous vehicles will change the world. He says people need to be encouraged to follow their dreams. Defterio: ""We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success"""

The Pantheon is a temple for all of the gods in Rome. The ceiling is like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome. The only source of light is an big open hole in the roof. This was the first church that I'd been to that provided an unrestricted view of the heavens.
"The Pantheon is the largest unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built. To make it even structurally possible, they had to invent super-strong concrete. To build the Pantheon took some miracles. It took 10 to 20 years to cut and drag stone blocks across the countryside."
"""I realized for the first time that light could be used to create art,"" says the artist. ""It's not just about light, it's about how to make it work,"" he says. ""You have to be able to combine it with other forms of art and science to create it"""
"CNN's John Defterios looks at some of the greatest architectural achievements of the 20th century. He says it's hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when the first man set foot on the moon. Defterio: ""It's remarkable that, after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art, that modern art is about 15 minutes old"""
"The Internet isn't a Pantheon. It's more like the invention of concrete: important, absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon, and enduring, but entirely insufficient by itself. New designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure."
The U.S. government has been developing autonomous vehicles for 30 years. The goal is to reduce the number of cars on the road and improve air quality. The technology will be used to create new ways of living and working in the United States. It will also reduce the cost of living.
"You must have near-continuous communication with high-performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent. The wireless technologies developed for mobile devices, with some minor modifications, are completely suitable to solve this. You'll probably want some restricted roadways to get started."
Liking a page for curly fries does not necessarily mean that you're smarter than the average person. The rise of social media and social networks in the early 2000s has changed the way we interact with each other. It turns out things like viral videos or Facebook likes or other information spreads in the same way that diseases spread through social networks.
"Liking something indicates a trait for you that's totally irrelevant to the content of what you've liked. There's a lot of power that users don't have to control how this data is used. ""We have good models of it. We have to put those things together and start seeing why things like this happen"""
"The revenue models for most social media companies rely on sharing or exploiting users' data in some way. It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users aren't the customer, they're the product. And so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users?"
"Twitter CEO: ""My goal is not to infer information about users, it's to improve the way people interact online"" ""I want users to be informed and consenting users of the tools that we develop,"" he says. ""I think all of us can agree that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward"""
"""Yo, bitch"" is a common greeting on Twitter. It is also used on Twitter when people are role-playing as dogs. In fact, in that case, it's not only not abusive, it is technically just an accurate greeting. The details have been changed to protect the innocent."
"In January 2009, we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform. We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it. That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors, and even then, we can still get it wrong."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at what happens when you add a photo to a tweet. Sutter: ""I try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death. And that's hard to do"""
"When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera, there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image. That's why, when we launched photos on Twitter, we made the decision to strip that geodata out. The vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way."
"Adrianne Haslet-Davis performs for the first time since the attack. She says technology is broken, and that a human being can never be ""broken"" ""I began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world of rock and ice climbing,"" she says."

Neri Oxman has created a 3D-printed model of a person's body. The model shows how the human body works. Oxman says we still don't know how to attach devices to the body. She hopes to use this technology to create prosthetic limbs.
"In the future, our clothing, our shoes, our braces, our prostheses, will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies, but rather, data-driven quantitative frameworks. With this framework, we've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn."
"Bionic limbs have been fitted to nearly 1,000 patients, 400 of which have been wounded U.S. soldiers. At heel strike, under computer control, the system controls stiffness to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground. At mid-stance, the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person into the walking stride."
"Steve Martin lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan. Martin has a normal physiology, so these exoskeletons are applying muscle-like torques and powers. The more I fire my muscles, the more torque I get, and I can even run, Martin says."
"Scientists are growing nerves, transected nerves, through channels, or micro-channel arrays. The nerve then attaches to cells, skin cells and muscle cells. When this is fully developed and for human use, persons like myself will have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone."
"Hugh Herr: Over half of the world's population suffers from some form of cognitive, emotional, sensory or motor condition. He says we can achieve these human rights, if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled. He tells the story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis, who lost her leg in the Boston terrorist attack."
"Dance is a form of expression that can't be stopped by violence. The Boston Marathon bombing killed more than 3,000 people. The attack also injured more than 1,000 others, many of whom were injured in the blast. The city is still recovering from the attack."

Intel set aside 475 million dollars to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw. The problem would come once out of every 360 billion calculations. The flaw was created by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos.
Gravitational waves from the fundamental era of the universe have long since faded. But gravitational waves put little twists in the structure of the light that we see. This is evidence of the ringing of the space-time of the early universe. It tells us that we and everything we see around us are one large bubble.
"The Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small, incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass. Now, we've mapped that afterglow with great precision, and one of the shocks about it is that it's almost completely uniform."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a group of college students about their plans for the future. Sutter: ""I think we're going to be able to do a lot of good things in the world"" Sutter says the future of the world is in the hands of young people who can learn from the past."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about how to teach magic to students. Sutter: ""If we could transform teacher education to focus on teaching teachers how to create that magic then poof! we could make dead classes come alive"" He says teachers need to go into the hood and learn how to engage with people."
"Bob Greene: Public spaces always need vigilant champions. He says it's not just the number of people using them, it's the greater number who feel better just knowing that they are there. Greene: It took nine months of nonstop negotiation to get a deal on the park."
"The park provided what New Yorkers crave: comfort and greenery. People would come in, find their own seat, move it a bit, and then stay a while. People themselves attracted other people, and ironically, I felt more peaceful if there were other people around."
"Cities are fundamentally about people, and where people go is at the core of what makes a city work. The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s. I wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling of Paley Park."
"Design is not just how something looks, it's how your body feels on that seat in that space, says Michael Bloomberg. ""I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience,"" he says. ""Some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces"""
The city of New York has been trying to find a way to reduce the number of new homes in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city's transit system is the key to solving the problem. The city has spent more than a decade working on a plan to make the city more sustainable.
Rezoning was never my mission. My mission was always to create great public spaces. I wanted to make sure that there were tree-lined paths from the upland to the water. I had no idea how it would turn out. But I had to have faith.
"After 9/11, the city had very little control over its waterfront. Now it has a public waterfront on all three sides. ""I love when people come there and look up and they say, ""Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close"""
"The High Line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on Manhattan's West Side. It became a self-seeded landscape, a kind of a garden in the sky. The High Line is widely known now and phenomenally popular, but it is the most contested public space in the city."
"The High Line has been pitted against development interests in New York City. The High Line may be the ultimate time-lapse image: the anatomy of Earth brought to life. With high-speed cameras, we can do the opposite of time lapse."
"We can see how nature's ingenious devices work, and perhaps we can even imitate them. We're unaware of things that are too small for us to see. And there are unseen creatures living all over your body, including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes."
"We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances, born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life. Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day, perhaps, repair DNA. Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries."
"""Mysteries of the Unseen World"" is a new 3D IMAX film. The film uses time lapse to show the movement of air traffic over the U.S. It also shows how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at sunlight."
"Sierra Leone is infamous for a decade-long rebel war in the '90s when entire villages were burnt down. An estimated 8,000 men, women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time. The prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb."
"In order to fulfill yourself, you have to forget yourself. The internal side of our nature is a moral logic and  often an inverse logic. We live in a society that favors Adam I, and often neglects Adam II. The résumé virtues are the ones you put on your ré sumé."
"""We're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it, how to confront it,  and how to combat it,"" he says. ""We live in a culture with an Adam I mentality where we're inarticulate about Adam II"" ""Adam I wants to conquer the world. Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world,"" he adds."
"Soloveitchik: In our quest to create happy kids, we may be assuming the wrong moral burden. He says it's better to focus on making productive kids and moral kids, and hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do. He asks: Why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish?"
"CNN's John Sutter looks at the changing role of children in the U.S. Sutter: ""We don't know what parenting is supposed to be"" He asks: How did we get to this point? Sutter says the answer is that we don't have a clear idea of what parenting should be."
"The old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical, but it was reciprocal. We provided food, clothing, shelter, and moral instruction to our kids, and they in return provided income. Once kids stopped working, the economics of parenting changed. The middle class now pours all of its time and energy into its kids."
"When he was a kid, high school specifically, I was told that I would be at sea in the new global economy if I did not know Japanese. The world is changing so rapidly, it's impossible to say. So, absent being able to anticipate the future, what we all do is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future."
"Most women today are in the workforce. Mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers. Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world, couples fight. Men spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them."
"The U.S. is one of eight countries that does not have a paid maternity leave policy. ""All I want is for my children to be happy,"" says mother-of-two Lisa Ling. ""Happiness is a wonderful goal for a child. But it is a very elusive one"""
"""Happiness and self-confidence can be the byproducts of other things, but they cannot really be goals unto themselves,"" he says. ""We are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world's ugliness that we now shield them from ""Sesame Street,"" he adds. ""Happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid"""
The author was high as a kite on morphine when he gave birth to his first child. He says the Hippocratic Oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness. All of us have said or done hurtful things that we wish to God we could take back.
"In the next decade, we'll be able to image an Earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life. It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer, the father of the space telescope, in 1962. We build a big screen, we fly it in front of the star, we block out most of the light, and boom, we get to see planets."
"Spitzer: If we can feather the edges, soften those edges so we can control diffraction, well then we can see a planet. Spitzer: My colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton and I are working on technology that will be able to do that in the coming years."
The starshade was built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL. Astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet. They speculate that up to one fifth of them have an Earth-like planet that might be able to harbor life.
"I think this is the coolest possible science. That's why I got into doing this, because I think that will change the world. We want to see if there's water, oxygen, ozone, the things that might tell us that it could harbor life."
It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's. But let's move yet again ten times further away. None of the straight lines are actually straight. It has that spark of life from the human hand that the program can never capture.
"The typeface is from the mid-'60s, the change from metal type to photo, hot to cold. The spacing system only provided 18 discrete units for letters to be accommodated on. The rigid 18-unit system really boxed me in. It kind of determined the proportions of the design."
"This is from the mid-'70s early trials of Bell Centennial typeface. It was my first experience of digital type, and quite a baptism of fire. Designed for the phone books, to be printed at tiny size on newsprint on very high-speed rotary presses."
"In the mid-'80s, the early days of digital outline fonts, vector technology. AT&amp;T had wanted to set the phone books in Helvetica, but the letters were designed to be as similar to one another as possible."
"CNN.com editor-in-chief's talk is about the connection between technology and design of type. ""I made a serif type, you can see it on the right, without curved serifs. I made them polygonal, out of straight line segments, chamfered brackets,"" he says."
"Charter is a sort of parable for me, really. I liked the design for its own sake. The technology has changed a number of times since I started work: photo, digital, desktop, screen, web. In the end, there was no hard and fast causal link."
"Microsoft wanted a typeface designed for the screen to face up to the problems of coarse resolution displays. At that time, screens were binary. The pixel was either on or it was off. Microsoft came back to say that affordable computer monitors with better resolutions were at least a decade away."
"In a binary bitmap, you actually can't ask for more than that. The designer's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad. The ""a"" in the upper one, I think, is better than the 'a' in the lower one, but it still ain't great."
It's been 18 years since Verdana and Georgia were released. Will they outlive the now-obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market? Or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche that is independent of technology?
"CNN's John Sutter watched an archer practice for three hours to hit a target. Sutter: ""I stayed because I realized I was witnessing what's so rare to glimpse, that difference between success and mastery"" ""What gets us to do this, what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win,"" he says."
"Mastery is in the reaching, not the arriving. We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge. The greater our proficiency, the more clearly we might see that we don't know all that we thought we did. We see it even in the life of the indomitable Arctic explorer."
"Success motivates us, but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest. A near win puts our goals, which we tend to put at a distance, into more proximate vicinity to where we stand. It gets us to focus on what, right now, we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights."
"In Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics. This is what's called a spirit line, a deliberate flaw in the pattern to give the weaver or maker a way out, but also a reason to continue making work."
"Australian naturalist Harry Butler suggests wetsuit banding to mimic shark warning systems. The web is awash with evidence that supports this sort of thinking, he says. It makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote because that's time-tested evolution."
The idea was to create a suit that could be worn by a shark. The suit would show the shark's face and not just its body. The idea was developed with the help of the University of W.A. and the Australian Shark Institute.
"The SAMS technology suit is designed to hide the wearer in the water column. The suit has three panels which match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially. Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years, culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period."
"Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement in July. The announcement was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see. For the first time, live, worldwide, I can show you what biological adaptation, science and design looks like in real life."
"Satellite is 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters, weighs four kilograms. It can take pictures 10 times the resolution of the big satellite. It's called ""Dove"" because satellites are typically named after birds of prey. It is the first time a space company has built a satellite."
The company's founders met at a United Nations conference 15 years ago. The team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity. The company has used modern production techniques to build large numbers of satellites at scale. The first two of the company's satellites were launched from the International Space Station.
CNN's John Defterios shows off the first image taken by a new satellite. More than 100 of the satellites will be launched over the next year. They will provide a radical new data set about our changing planet. The satellites will take pictures as the Earth rotates underneath them.
"The satellite will be able to track urban growth as it happens around the whole world in all cities, every day. The data will also help water security and help improve crop yield. The image on the left is from our satellite, and we see buildings are being built."
"The satellite imagery we have of the planet today is old. We want to democratize access to information about our planet. Satellites are big, expensive and they're slow. We believe that together, we can help to take care of our Spaceship Earth."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his new project, Planet Labs. The project aims to make satellites ultra-compact and highly capable. Sutter says his inspiration came in the most unlikely and unexpected place. He says he wanted to be a writer, but failed at it for six years."
"""Eat, Pray, Love"" is a memoir about the author's life and career. The author says his home has always been writing. ""Your home is whatever in this world you love more than you love yourself,"" he says."
"""Eat, Pray, Love"" was a huge break for the author. ""I knew that I had broken the spell and I had found my way back home to writing,"" she says. ""The only trick is that you've got to identify the best, worthiest thing that you love most,"" she adds."
The project was inspired by the idea that people should be able to use their hands to express themselves. The project involved building a series of small robots that could be used to move around a table. The idea was to create a way for people to interact with their hands without using a computer.
The system uses a combination of a computer and a physical hand. It can be used to move objects in a variety of ways. The technology is being trialled in the U.S. and is set to be rolled out in other countries.
"The ""Chase"" is a race between two pairs of shoes. Each shoe is attached to a pendulum, which can be used to play different notes. The chases end when the runner crosses the finish line. It's a way for people to test the limits of the human body."
"Olympic record: 1,314 miles (2,788 km) by Roger Bannister in 1964. He was the first man to run a sub-four-minute mile. He ran on cinders, which are one and a half percent faster."
"In 1972, the world record for a 100-mile bike ride was set at 3,774 feet. Now, the record is 2,856 feet. The new record is for a 50-mile race, set at 2,788 feet."
"In the early half of the 20th century, physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors. In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper and average elite shot-putter were the same exact size. But as that idea started to fade away, as sports scientists and coaches realized that you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches, a form of artificial selection took place."
"In 1983, the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league. Almost overnight, the proportion of men in the NBA who are at least seven feet tall doubled to 10 percent. A seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare in the general population -- so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of 20 and 40, there's a 17 percent chance he's in theNBA right now."
"Human brain acts as a limiter, preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources. Endurance and ultra-endurance sports serve as a great example of this. Ultra-end endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health, but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra- endurance."
"Athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet have taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before. Technology, changing genes, and a changing mindset have conspired to make athletes stronger, faster, bolder, and better than ever."
There are 39 million people in the world who are blind. Eighty percent of them are living in low-income countries such as Kenya. The retina is the single part of the eye that has huge amounts of information about the body and its health.
"Peek Vision is an app that locates people who are blind from a curable or preventable disease. Project managers, hospital directors, are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in. For patients like Mama Wangari, who have been blind for over 10 years and never seen her grandchildren, for less than 40 dollars we can restore her eyesight."
"""We can see all parts of the eye and of the body. It makes it possible to pick up diseases that would not be possible without access to the eye"" ""We have developed a system that can be used by anyone in any part of the world"" ""It's a new way to provide eye care for people in need"""
"Climate models in the 1990s took an even smaller chunk of that, only about three orders of magnitude. The stuff that we can't resolve, the sub-scale processes, we need to approximate in some way. New-fangled ideas like C really haven't had a big impact on the climate modeling community."
"We can look at all of the different equations that go into making the ice grow or melt or change shape. We can encapsulate that in code. These models are around a million lines of code at this point, and growing by tens of thousands of code every year."
"There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit over hundreds of thousands of years. Big volcanoes go off and change the climate. Deforestation changes the climate by changing the surface properties. Changes in biomass burning, in smoke, in aerosol particles, all of those things change theClimate."
"The question is whether a model tells you more information than you would have had otherwise. The models are skillful, not just in the global mean, but also in regional patterns. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 put an enormous amount of aerosols, small particles, into the stratosphere."

"We build them so they look like us, behave like us and think like us. The perfect robot will be indistinguishable from the human, and that scares us. In the first story about robots, they turn against their creators. It's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction."
"We use robots to create the illusion of trust between humans and machines. To create the robotic illusion, we've devised a set of ethical rules that all robots would live by. A robot may not harm humanity, or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm."

"CNN's John Defterios takes a musical tour of the world of ants. He meets a blind, autistic piano player, a spoken word poet and a crossfader. Defterius: ""All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants"""
"In the desert, operating costs are high because water is scarce. An ant outside foraging, searching for seeds in the hot sun, just loses water into the air. The colony gets its water by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds that they eat."
Researchers have been tracking a population of ant colonies for 28 years. They were able to find out which colonies were founded by which parent. They also found that the parent colonies were more likely to stay inside on hot days. This is the first time that scientists have been able to track the evolution of a population.
"An ant colony consists of sterile female workers and one or more reproductive females. So data doesn't leave the source computer unless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth. Operating costs are low in the tropics, because it's easy for the ants to be outside."
"The problem is that when there are many ants in a space, they need to stretch out their search area. So the ants are working so hard to hang on to the wall or the floor that they're less likely to find each other. The researchers are trying to solve this problem by using different species of ants."
"Ants smell with their antennae, so when one ant touches another with its antennae it can tell, for example, if the other ant is a nestmate and what task that other ant has been doing. We could learn from this about other systems that operate without central control."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the importance of trust in the military. Sutter: ""We give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain"" He asks: ""Where do people like this come from? And my initial conclusion was that they're just better people"""

"Oceana has seen an 18-percent decline in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch since 1980. But we know how to turn it around, and that's what I'm going to talk about today. We can do a few simple things in targeted places, and use them to feed people."
"There are seven times as many fish in the coastal areas than there are in the high seas. The European Union manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy. If we took it up to 24 countries plus the European Union, we would up to 90 percent, almost all of the world's fish catch."
"When countries set limits, or quotas, on its fishery, what happens? The fishery comes back. We've seen this happening in countries all around the world, time and time again. If we take that fishery catch that's on the decline and we could turn it upwards, we could increase it."
"Fish is the most cost-effective protein on the planet. It also doesn't need a lot of land, something that's in short supply, compared to other protein sources. It uses a lot less fresh water than, for example, cattle, where you have to irrigate a field."
"In the oceans, biodiversity is not at war with abundance. When we do things that produce biodiversity, we actually get more abundance. The way illegal fish get into our market is through fraud. It's when fish are labeled as something they're not."
A third of fish samples tested were not what they were labeled to be. Traceability is a way where the seafood industry can track the seafood from the boat to the plate. 450 chefs have signed a petition calling on Congress to support the SAFE Seafood Act.

"The author says she survived her childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance. After you've forged meaning, you need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity. Identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community, and to give strength there, too."
"Forging meaning and building identity is about changing the world. Forging meaning does not make what was wrong right. It only makes what waswrong precious. Dr. Ma Thida, a leading human rights activist, spent many years in solitary confinement."
"""We don't seek the painful experiences that hew our identities, but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences"" ""We could have been ourselves without our delights, but not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning"" ""People always give us these little sayings like, 'God doesn't give you any more than you can handle'"
"Bob Greene was one of a group of artists who stood up against the Soviet Union. He says the artists were fighting against a society that was annihilating humanity. Greene: Sometimes, forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need to fight for your freedom."
"""I would have had an easier life if I were straight, but I would not be me,"" he says. ""I like being myself better than being someone else,"" he adds. ""If you banish the dragons, and we become attached to the heroic strain, that's a good thing"""
"Gay rights are not primarily marriage rights, and for the millions who live in unaccepting places with no resources, dignity remains elusive. I am lucky to have forged meaning and built identity, but that's still a rare privilege. And gay people deserve more, collectively, than the crumbs of justice."
"In 1902, the U.S. government created the first teddy bear. It was a symbol of the end of the days when wolves and bears were considered dangerous. Today's teddy bears represent a new way to look at nature, author says."
"CNN's John Defterios is a journalist and author. He is best known for his book ""The Secret Life of the Bumblebee"" He is also the author of ""Bumblebee,"" a best-selling book about the bumblebee."
"In 1902, America was urbanizing. For the first time, nearly a majority of people lived in cities. There was a safe space where we could reconsider the bear and romanticize it. We exert our power, but then we're unsettled by how powerful we are."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the rise of the ""billy possum"" as a toy. The toy was a response to Teddy Roosevelt's hunt of an opossum in 1902. Sutter: Opossum was a delicacy in the Southern United States."
"The toy was an absolute flop, and it was almost completely forgotten by the end of the year. The story of the billy possum was all wrong, especially compared to the backstory of the teddy bear. We're living now in an age of what scientists have started to call ""conservation reliance"""
The line between conservation and domestication is blurred. The stories that we tell about wild animals are so subjective they can be irrational or romanticized or sensationalized. How we feel about an animal affects its survival more than anything that you read about in ecology textbooks.
"When he was in high school, he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. He decided to join the Army, and soon realized that he was growing up. He says he's excited to be here to speak about vets, but he doesn't want to go to war."
"""I didn't join the Army because I wanted to go to war, the truth is, I joined in 1996,"" he says. ""After 9/11, there was an entirely new context about the occupation that I chose"" ""I remember walking out with my unit for the first time, and when you go through a combat tour, everyone looks at your shoulder"""
"No one in my family ever had joined the military at all, and how I first got introduced to the military was when I was 13 years old. And I was the only person walking around with a bare shoulder, and it burned every time someone stared at it. But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers and you ask them why did they sign up."
"When he first came back from Afghanistan, I thought that if you make it back from conflict, then the dangers were all over. I wanted people to come up to me and tell me, ""What was it like? What was the food like?"" And the only questions I got from people was, ""Did you shoot anybody?"""
"""Thank you for your service"" means acknowledging our stories, asks us who we are, understanding the strength that so many people who we serve with, have, and why that service means so much,"" she says. ""Just because we've now come home and we've taken off the uniform does not mean our larger service to this country is somehow over"""
"""We signed up because we love this country we represent,"" Rep. Tammy Duckworth says. Duckworth: ""Thank you for your service"" needs to be more than just a quote break. ""These are the people who I served with, and these are thePeople who I honor,"" she says."
Travelers in the U.S. take advantage of laws that make it illegal to sleep on the street. The law also makes it illegal for people to sleep in their cars. Travelers say they would rather live in the open air than in a hotel room.
"This is the nomadic dream, a different kind of American dream lived by young hobos, travelers, hitchhikers, vagrants and tramps. The word ""hobo"" conjures up an old black and white image of a weathered old man covered in coal."
"Singer-songwriters are rewarded for revealing their innermost thoughts on the page for the entertainment of others. But if you can't write about yourself anymore, then who do you write about? ""It was always a Faustian pact anyway,"" singer-songwriter says."
"The singer-songwriter returns to the community he left to find his missing muse. ""A torrent of ideas, of characters, of verses, couplets, materialized in front of me,"" he says. ""Sometimes you reveal more about yourself than you'd ever intended,"" he adds."
"""I was infected. I was infected with an idea. I don't belong in this street,"" he says. ""We're having a moment, me and the Queen Mother. She's acknowledged me. And then she's gone,"" he adds. ""I wasn't cured of anything. It was the opposite, actually"""

"Christopher Hitchens wrote a book called ""God Is Not Great"" Hitchens' subtitle was, ""Religion Poisons Everything"" ""You don't have to believe in a God per se, just in being Jewish,"" a rabbi tells Hitchens. The Dalai Lama's religion does not involve belief in God."
"Christianity is an extremely specific tradition. It has all kinds of things in it that are the results of the specifics of Christian history. It's a religion in which people are really concerned about whether you believe the right things. It was actually adverted to earlier, but a very specific thing happened in the late 19th century."
"In the early 19th century, if you made a claim about the age of the Earth, you had to explain it. By the end of the century, it was possible for people to write about anything without having to explain their religious beliefs."
"Rattray: ""Every time they do anything, they're conscious of the ancestors"" ""This is not a world in which the separation between religion and science has occurred"" ""It would take a long while to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing that could be washed"""
"A study of change in people's personal values over time. At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set, people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next 10 years. We call this the ""end of history"" illusion."
"At every age, people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade. The rate of change does slow as we age. People predict that the friend they have now is the one they'll have in 10 years. But people who are 10 years older say, ""Eh, you know, that's really changed"""
"We overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences. We find it hard to imagine who we will be 10 years from now. It's as if, for most of us, the present is a magic time. We work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain."
"The person you are right now is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been. Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished. Poems are easy to share, easy to pass on, and when you read a poem, you can imagine someone's speaking to you."
"CNN's John Sutter reads some of the best-known poems of the 20th century. One of the poems, ""The Garden of Earthly Delights,"" was written by A.E. Hirst. Sutter: ""Poems can bring people together temporarily, and it sticks in my head"""
"The poem is about the Garden of Eden and the Fall, in which sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time. The poem reacts to old lipstick ads, and its edginess about statement, its reversals and halts, have everything to do with resisting the language of ads."
"Poet Wallace Stevens' poem ""The Brave"" is about a person who is afraid of the sun. Stevens: ""Poems show us not just what somebody thought or what someone did or what happened but what it was like to be a person like that"" The poem is older than Armantrout's but a little younger than A. E. Housman's."
"Poems can help you say, help you show how you're feeling, but they can also introduce you to feelings, ways of being in the world, people, very much unlike you, maybe even people from long, long ago. John Keats is doing in his most mysterious, perhaps, poem."
"The robots are made up of compliant joints that are tubes and plates connected to one another. They can even lose three legs, in a tripod, and adopt a new gait, a hopping gait. The robots are called DASH, for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod."
"Cockroaches can compress their body by over 40 percent. They can go through three-millimeter gaps, the height of two pennies. Their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower."
"The neocortex is 80 percent of our brain, and that's where we do our thinking. It's the great sublimator. We still have that old brain that provides our basic drives and motivations. But I may have a drive for conquest. That'll be sublimated by the neocortex into writing a poem."
"The amount of data we're getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year. We can now see inside a living brain and see individual interneural connections connecting in real time. We have about 300 million of them, and we create them in these hierarchies."
Computer scientists are beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex. Watson got a higher score than the best two players combined on Jeopardy. Watson could invent new behaviors rather than the fixed behaviors that non-mammalian animals have.
"In the 2030s, if you need some extra neocortex, you'll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain. 20 years from now, we'll have nanobots, because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology. And our thinking will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking."
"No other species has done that. We're going to again expand our neocortex, only this time we won't be limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure. That additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology. Thank you very much."
"New laws make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their property. The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism are not about violence, they're about public relations. The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago, and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his experiences with the FBI. Sutter says he was arrested for reporting on environmental activists. He says people in power have used fear to silence the truth and silence dissent. ""Our best weapon is sunlight,"" he says."
"Hackers are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft. ""With great power comes great responsibility, and you all like to think that if we had such powers, we would only use them for good,"" hacker Kyle Lovett says."
"A group of hackers used ""jackpotting"" to get into people's files. They left a note: Your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world. They broke the law, but they also forced that company to fix their product."
"CNN's John Defterios says the world needs a new way of thinking about the Internet. He says it's time for a new generation of Internet users to take control of their own destiny. Defterio: ""We need to make sure that we don't let the Internet be used as a tool to destroy the world"""
"Hackers are in the business of redistribution, but what they are after isn't your money. They grab the spotlight for causes they support, forcing us to take note. They can bring people together. And if the Internet doesn't like it, just watch what happens when you try to shut the Internet down."
"The Syrian Electronic Army is a pro-Assad group of hackers. They've taken down multiple high-profile targets in the past few years. In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula to Latin America, from Europe to the United States, hackers are a force for social, political and military influence."
"The rules of the game are not that clear anymore, but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data-hoarding corporates. They make us, they force us to fix things or demand something better, and I think we need them to do just that. After all, it is not information that wants to be free, it's us."
"In a few years, it's quite likely we will have a family tree with all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth, he says. ""This is an unprecedented history of the human race, and it's giving us valuable data about how diseases are inherited, how people migrate"""
"We all have a bit of our ancestors' DNA in us, he says. The farthest cousin you have on Earth is about a 50th cousin. ""I think that there's also a human bias to treat your family a little better than strangers,"" he adds."
"""We're not just part of the same species. We share 99.9 percent of our DNA"" ""I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots and you're not, so you cannot join my family"" ""It's really a fascinating time in the history of family because it's changing so fast"""
"I see this as a family reunion meets a world's fair. Paul McCartney is 11 steps away, so I'm hoping he brings his guitar. Cass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhaps the most brilliant legal scholar, will be talking. George H.W. Bush, number 41, the father, and Nick Kroll, the comedian, and Dr. Oz, and many more to come."
"Genealogy is going through a fascinating revolution, and a controversial one. Partly, this is because of DNA and genetic testing, but partly, it's because of the Internet. There are sites that now take the Wikipedia approach to family trees, collaboration and crowdsourcing."
"Dictionaries are fantastic resources, but they are not timeless. Even the most critical people out there tend not to be very critical about dictionaries. ""Look it up in the dictionary,"" suggests that all dictionaries are exactly the same. ""I'm struck as a teacher that we tell students to critically question every text they read"""
"Every January, the American Dialect Society votes on the word of the year. In the past, some of the winners have been ""tweet"" in 2009 and ""hashtag"" in 2012. ""My all-time favorite word at this vote, which is ""multi-slacking,"" is ""YOLO"""
"Lake Superior State University issues its list of banished words for the year. ""Plutoed,"" to mean demoted, was the word of the year in 2006. Some of the past winners now seem completely unremarkable, such as ""app"" and ""e"" as prefix, and ""google"" as a verb."
"Dictionaries include usage notes for words that are considered slang or offensive. ""Impact"" is described as ""boorish, bureaucratic misspeak"" ""LOL"" and ""defriend"" are considered ""inappropriate"" by the Oxford English Dictionary."
"American Heritage Dictionaries names 200 people on its Usage Panel. They include academicians, journalists, creative writers and a Supreme Court justice. ""I do not like the word ""impactful,"" but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether "" impactful"" is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written prose"""
The English language is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it. The language is not going to change so fast that we can't keep up. I hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome but fun and fascinating.
"Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource, but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what words mean. Realizing that small choices can also be hard, may make big hard choices seem less intractable. We also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard because we are stupid."
"In hard choices, there is no best option, so we take the least risky option. Fear of being an unemployed philosopher led him to become a lawyer, and as he discovered, lawyering wasn't who he was. Hard choices are hard not because of us or our ignorance; they're hard because there isno best option. If alternatives are equally good, you should flip a coin between them."
"If you have two jobs and one is better, which one should you choose? We've got two jobs, but they're not equally good, so what's the difference? Here's how it works: If you have a job that's better than the other, you should do it."
"Hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing, hand-washing, the gnashing of teeth. The stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers, the other world can't. We're weighing the merits of two jobs, after all, not a plate of fried eggs."
"In a world of only easy choices, there's always a best alternative, says David Frum. He says there's no reason to believe that one alternative is better, worse or equal to the other. Instead, he says, the alternatives are in the same neighborhood of value, while at the same time being different."
"In any easy choice, one alternative is better than the other. When we choose between options that are on a par, we can do something rather remarkable. We can put our very selves behind an option. We might decide to be a pink sock-wearing, cereal-loving, country-living banker."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the joys of making hard choices. He says hard choices are opportunities to celebrate what is special about the human condition. Sutter: ""We have the power to create reasons for ourselves to become the distinctive people that we are"""
"CNN's John Sutter writes about his experiences in North Korea. Sutter: ""It's not what you do, it's how you do it"" Sutter says he's been trying to make sense of his experiences for the past 24 years."
"In recent years Americans are working fewer hours than 50 years ago. We have more and more time, but sometimes, it seems, less and less time. In many a piece of music, it's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty."
"When he was 29, David Perry decided to remake his entire life in the light of going nowhere. He abandoned his dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto, Japan. Perry: ""I sometimes think I'd rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails"""
"CNN's John Sutter travels the world and writes about his experiences. Sutter: ""Travel allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world"" He says he's noticed more people taking conscious measures to open up a space inside themselves."
"In an age of constant movement, nothing is so urgent as sitting still. So, if you want to come back home alive and full of love, I think you might want to try considering going nowhere. And a few people do that for us by going to the movies."
"I was a young drug dealer with a quick temper and a semi-automatic pistol. I ran black market stores, I loan sharked, and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled into the prison. Because of my activity, I landed in solitary confinement for seven and a half years."
"""I had to look at my life in a new way,"" says the former prisoner. ""I realized I was a child who had been through some hardships and made a series of poor decisions"" ""Most of the people I met in prison wanted help and they wanted to turn it around,"" he says."
"In 2010, I walked out of prison for the first time after two decades. I was exposed to the Internet, social media, cars that talk like KITT from ""Knight Rider"" But the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology. I had no idea what all these abbreviated texts meant."
"""I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others. I also had to apologize to the people I had Hurt,"" she says. ""Anybody can have a transformation if we create the space for that to happen"" ""My journey is a unique journey, but it doesn't have to be that way,"" she adds. ""We have a role in determining what kind of men and women return to our community"""
"Carnegie Mellon's new password policy requires a lot of entropy. The professor suggests that people think about things that make them happy. He also suggests that we think about our pasts, not our present or future. He hopes that people will think about their pasts and not their future."
"The National Institute of Standards and Technology has some rules of thumb for measuring entropy. NIST would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose, but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data. 80 percent of people said they were reusing their password."
"Researchers used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk to create 5,000 passwords. They paid people about 50 cents to create a password and answer a survey. They then paid them again to come back and log in using their password and answering another survey. The study looked at how long it would take to crack these passwords."
"A study found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong, and the complex passwords were pretty strong too. Some people had long passwords that actually weren't very strong. People were really frustrated by the very complex passwords, the study found. The study suggests that, instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers into their passwords, we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords."
We tested different types of passwords to see which were most effective. The most effective were the ones that made you work harder to remember them. We also used a cartoon character to test the effectiveness of different passwords. We hope this has helped you find the right one.
"The study found that, surprisingly, pass phrases were not actually all that good. People were not really better at remembering the pass phrases than these random passwords. The researchers are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better."
The passwords were created by a group of students at Carnegie Mellon University. The students created the passwords using a computer program. The passwords were then put into a database to be used by the university. The database was then used to create a list of all the passwords.
"""Monkey"" is one of the most popular words in the English language. The word is used to refer to a person or a thing. It can also be used to describe a person, a place, a thing or a person. It is also used as a name for a child."
"CNN's John Sutter meets two dogs who have taken the command ""speak"" quite literally. The first dog is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner. The next dog speaks in something called the revenant, which means a spirit that comes back to visit you."
"The human voice is the most powerful sound in the world, probably. The word ""hail"" has a great definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically. Dogmatism is the confusion of facts with opinions. We don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us."
"H is honesty, of course, being true in what you say, being straight and clear. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously."
"The voice is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened, says Sir Paul McCartney. He shows you how to use the tools to increase the power of your speaking. You can locate your voice, however, and you can train your voice to be more powerful."
"""I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning,"" he says. ""There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs,"" he adds."
"I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into. Warm up your voice. Some people broadcast the whole time. Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately."
"Do these steps any time you're going to talk to anybody important. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. Then, roll an R. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren."
"phthalmologist Dr. Richard Branson: ""We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics"" ""We know people who are like this in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time"""
"CNN's John Defterios says he's changed his mind about living in a rich country. He says he wants to live in a ""good country"" and that the number 6.8 can change the world. Defterio: ""We can use it to change the way that our politicians and our companies behave"""
"""We've somehow got to get our act together and we've got to figure out how to globalize the solutions better"" ""There's one superpower left on the planet and that is the seven billion of us who cause all these problems,"" he says."
"We need to find ways of encouraging countries to start working together a little bit better. Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards? The first and most obvious reason is because that's what we tell them to do. The second reason is that these governments, just like all the rest of us, are cultural psychopaths."
"There's a belief that the domestic and international agendas are incompatible. This is just nonsense, says the head of the World Health Organisation. We should accept that we are an inherently conservative species, he says. ""We probably wouldn't still be here today if we weren't so resistant to change"""
"CNN's John Defterios is the founder of the Nation Brands Index. The index is based on a survey of 70% of the world's population. It aims to find out what people think about their countries and the world at large. Defterio: ""This is the miracle that has enabled us to transship our bodies and our minds"""
"The Good Country Index measures how much each country contributes to the rest of the world. It is the first time the index has been used to measure the contribution of a country to the world as a whole. The index ranks countries based on their contribution to the global good, not just their own population."
No country on Earth contributes more to the world that we live in than Ireland. Finland ranks pretty much the same. The only reason why it's below Ireland is because its lowest score is lower than Ireland's lowest score. A lot of us are not aware of the extraordinary successes of the Millennium Development Goals.
"The top 10 countries in the Good Country Index are all Western European nations. Germany is 13th, the U.S. is 21st, Mexico comes 66th and Russia is 95th. The index is available on goodcountry.org."
"I've had enough hearing about competitive countries, he says. ""Good"" is the opposite of selfish, good being a country that thinks about all of us,"" he adds. ""I feel that globalization has taken us by surprise, and we've been slow to respond to it,"" he writes."
"In 1942, Japanese-Americans were rounded up with no charges, with no trial. ""We were to be rounded up and imprisoned in some of the most desolate places in America"" ""I will never be able to forget that scene. It is burned into my memory"""

"When Pearl Harbor was bombed, young Japanese-Americans rushed to their draft board to volunteer to fight for our country. That act of patriotism was answered with a slap in the face. They were denied service, and categorized as enemy non-alien. They fought with amazing, incredible courage and valor."
"The men of the 442nd scaled a sheer rock cliff to break a six-month stalemate with the Germans. The men climbed for eight hours straight, and those who made it to the top stayed there until the first break of light. They were greeted back on the White House Lawn by President Truman."
"The Facebook ""Like"" button was redesigned over 280 hours. The design of the button had to be constrained by specific height and width parameters. ""The little things really matter,"" says the designer who designed the button. ""We are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale,"" he says."
Facebook's 'Like' button is one of the single most viewed design elements ever created. The button is seen on average 22 billion times a day and on over 7.5 million websites. Facebook has had a tool that allowed people to report photos that may be in violation of community standards.
A new tool allows people to post photos of themselves that they don't like. The photo can then be taken down by the person who posted it. The tool was created to help people express how the photo made them feel. The project is now being rolled out to more people.
"""Data-driven"" is a term that is used to describe how design decisions are made. But it's also a way of saying that good design is not always the same as good design. ""We use data to inform our decisions, but we also rely heavily on human intuition,"" he says."
The new design for YouTube's mobile app is designed to make it easier for people to use the app. The new design is the result of a lot of work by the team at YouTube. The team is now working on a version of the app that will be available to all YouTube users.
Designing for low-end cell phones is not glamorous work. It means finding the audacity and the humility to do right by them. We use our products in non-English languages to make sure that they work just as well. It's the never-ending thrill of being a part of something so big.
"Amel Zenoune died at exactly 5:17 p.m., which we know because when she fell in the street, her watch broke. The men who cut her throat then told everyone else, ""If you go to university, the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this"" Her name even means ""hope"" in Arabic."
Mahfoud Bennoune is the son of an Algerian professor. He wrote a series on fundamentalism in Algeria in the 1990s. He says the struggle against fundamentalism is one of the most important and overlooked human rights struggles in the world.
"According to a 2009 survey of Arabic language media, no more than 15 percent of al Qaeda's victims were Westerners. Some may be non-governmental organizations, like the Muslim Brotherhood, and some may be openly armed groups like the Taliban. But in any case, these are all radical projects."
"CNN's John Defterios speaks to four people whose stories he had the great honor of telling.

"The power of the idea of choice is still strong among the poor, says Frida Ghitis. Ghitis: ""We rarely make really rational choices. Choices are influenced by our unconscious, by our imaginations"" She asks: ""How come even people who are poor can still identify with the concept of choice?"""
"We are choosing by looking at what others are choosing. We're also guessing what is socially acceptable. Now, because of this, we actually even after we have already chosen, endlessly read reviews about cars, as if we still want to convince ourselves that we made the right choice."
The author and his friend Bernard Harcourt delivered their papers at a conference on the idea of chance. The pair decided to take chance seriously and read their papers in a way that made it seem like a completely random paper. The author says that people are turning a blind eye to the fact that chance is becoming more and more traumatic.
"Psychoanalysts know that people surprisingly don't have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance. When we are ignorant about where we are heading, a lot of social damage can be caused. In today's times of post-industrial capitalism, choice, together with individual freedom and the idea of self-making, has been elevated to an ideal."
"Why would people who have no health insurance not embrace universal healthcare? Sometimes they don't embrace it, again identifying with the idea of choice, but they have nothing to choose from. We identify with the guru who tells us what to do, self-help therapist, or we embrace a totalitarian leader who sort of knows."

"In 2003, the FDA said that trocar incisions might be the most dangerous step in minimally invasive surgery. A lot of neurosurgical procedures actually start with a drill incision through the skull. And if the surgeon isn't careful, he can plunge directly into the brain."
"Laparoscopic surgery, epidurals, and cranial drilling account for over 30,000 complications every year in the U.S. The key to this problem is that all these different puncture devices share a common set of fundamental physics."
"Newton says the wall is going to apply force back, equal and opposite to the forward force. But what if right at the moment of puncture you could pull that tip back, actually oppose the forward acceleration? That's what I set out to do."
"Bob Prottas: The first time I stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery, I had no idea what to expect. The more surgeries I watched, the more I realized this is how it is. The device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling."
"Puncture is a problem that has been injuring and even killing people for over 100 years. I worked on this because this problem really fascinated me. It kept me up at night. But I think it should fascinate you too, because I said puncture is everywhere."

"Physarum polycephalum, a type of slime mold, grows at about one centimeter an hour. I fed it a varied diet and observed as it networked. It formed a connection between food sources. I watched it leave a trail behind it, indicating where it had been."
The slime mold is one of 700 known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba. Researchers exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold. The slime mold slowed down in anticipation of the cold air. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime Mold had a primitive form of intelligence.
"The single-celled organism, a cell, joins together with other cells to form a mass super-cell to maximize its resources. The slime mold had replicated the Tokyo transport network. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem."
"The Slime Mould Collective is a social network for people to experiment with the slime mold. Members include scientists, artists, architects and designers. The group has also run a series of public slime-making events in the UK. The slime mold is being used as a tool for social cohesion and communication."
"Researchers in Rotterdam tied people together so they were a giant cell, and invited them to follow slime mold rules. When they met trees, they had to reshape their connections and reform as a mass cell through not speaking. An entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park. Each person brought in their own individual interpretation."
"A microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it. A lot of my work draws on the scientific research, so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way.

There are no limits to the number of students who can take part in the program. The program is open to students from all over the world who want to take part. There is no limit to the amount of time that can be spent on the course. The cost of the program is free.
"Every week, every student must contribute to the class discussion, and also must comment on the contribution of others. By the end of the course, they take the final exam, get a grade, and follow to the next course. All we ask our students to cover is the cost of their exams, 100 dollars per exam."

"Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy. They're usually referred to as a model figure, a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs. The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas."
"A new, free, open-source software, Molecular Flipbook, is created just for biologists. It only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis. The beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today."
"HK: In a democracy, the rules are for everybody, so it's not allowed that any institution doesn't respect the rules. In 1917, the Russian Communists founded the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, shortly Cheka. In the criminal code of Germany, it is not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the judge."
"There has been a debate in Germany about granting asylum to Edward Snowden. This year, Germany is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Stasi, the secret police of East Germany, was established in 1945."
"In 1953, the Stasi had more employees than the Gestapo had, the secret police of Nazi Germany. The number doubled in each decade. In 1989, more than 90,000 employees worked for the Stasis. One employee was responsible for 180 inhabitants, which was really unique in the world."
"Germany inherited the archives of the East German secret police, known as the Stasi. More than 11,000 soldiers were serving in its so-called Guards Regiment. Every day, 90,000 letters were being opened by these machines. The Stasi even collected the smell of people."
The Stasi had its own university to teach people how to be informants. The Stasi also had a network of informants who could be used to get information. The system was set up in the 1950s after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
"Two of my best friends reported about me to the Stasi. The main purpose was to control the society. The Stasi often used a method which was really diabolic. It was called Zersetzung, and it's described in another guideline."
"The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident. It preferred to paralyze them, and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information. Detaining someone was used only as a last resort. The Stasi owned 17 remand prisons, one in every district."
"Bruno Giussani: The Stasi died because of the structures that it was charged with protecting. The leadership stuck to the belief that socialism is a perfect system, and the Stasi had to confirm that. Despite all the information, the regime couldn't analyze its real problems, and therefore it couldn't solve them."

"Fez, Morocco, boasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world, nestled in a river valley. The city received a grant to divert sewage water and to treat it. With clean water, suddenly the uncovering of the river became possible. The Rcif Plaza is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland."
"The Fez River has been covered little by little by concrete slabs since 1952. The entire city of Fez is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The project aims to transform the river from sewage to public space for all, thereby making sure the city will remain a living city for its inhabitants."
"In 1984, a team of farmers in Kenya and Rwanda were insured against drought. They paid an average of half an acre and paid on average two Euros in premium. Traditional insurance doesn't work with two to three Euros of premium, because it relies on farm visits. So instead, we rely on technology and data, such as satellite images."
"The real challenge was selling insurance to Kenyan farmers. The data alone isn't enough. We devise agronomic algorithms which tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when. At the end of the season, you actually don't want it to rain, because rains then can damage the crop."
"Only 4.4 percent of Africans taking up insurance in 2012, and half of that number is in one country, South Africa. One goro goro can feed three meals for an average family, and in 1984, the whole harvest could fit in one goro Goro."

Most mental disorders in the U.S. are fear and anxiety disorders. Mood disorders may actually just be the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal. Obsessive compulsive disorders also are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing which is keeping yourself clean and groomed.
"Dogs can develop compulsions like this that they then engage in all day. They'll develop fixations like chasing their tails compulsively. Other common behaviors that you may see, particularly in captive animals, are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies."
"Many animals develop mood disorders. Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan are coming back with what's considered canine PTSD. Some parrots actually have been studied to better understand trichotillomania, or compulsive plucking in humans."

They gave him a rabbit, and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey. He was extremely happy to be with this rabbit."
"One in five Americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug. The drugs were tested in non-human animals first, and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects. SeaWorld gives mother orcas antianxiety medications when their calves are taken away. Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics."
"The animal pharmaceutical industry is growing, from seven billion dollars in 2011 to a projected 9.25 billion by the year 2015. Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely. The thing, though, I believe, that helps the most, particularly with social animals, is time with other social animals."
"As science offers greater power and promise, the downside gets scarier too. Within a few decades, millions will have the capability to misuse rapidly advancing biotech. We must surely try, but these enterprises are so competitive, so globalized, and so driven by commercial pressure."
"Scientists should be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world. Americans like instant gratification and the reverse.

"In 1781, an English composer, technologist and astronomer called William Herschel noticed an object on the sky that didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did. In many ways, this is the way we think of our universe: eternal and unchanging. But the universe is anything but static. It constantly changes on timescales of seconds to billions of years."
"One image from the LSST is equivalent to 3,000 images from the Hubble Space Telescope. Each image is three and a half degrees on the sky, seven times the width of the full moon. Over the mission lifetime of this telescope, it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies."
"Astronomy is constantly being transformed by this capacity to collect data. The LSST will be able to see asteroids far beyond the inner part of our solar system. The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids, dry and stony in the center, water-rich towards the edge."
"It took three years to find just 42 supernovae, because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy. Small changes allow us to make discoveries, like the planet found by Herschel. The universe must not just be expanding, but this expansion must be accelerating."
"With the LSST, we get a completely new view of the skies above Chile every three nights. In its first night of operation, it will find 10 times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy. By combining these supernova data with other measures of cosmology, we'll progressively rule out the different ideas."

"CNN's John Sutter talks about the mystery of existence and why you should care. Sutter: One theory is that God was so bored with pondering the puzzle of His own existence that He created the world just to distract himself. The laws of quantum field theory, the state-of-the-art physics, can show how out of sheer nothingness, no space, no time, no matter, nothing, a little nugget of false vacuum can fluctuate into existence"
"Lawrence of religion sees physical laws as being like divine commands. The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss, that it's pregnant with being. But that's a very primitive view of what a scientific law is. Stephen Hawking put forward a model of the cosmos that was self-contained."
"Physicists have been puzzled by the idea that all possible physical worlds really exist, they're all out there. We just see a little tiny part of reality that's described by the laws of quantum field theory, but there are many, many other worlds that are different from ours."

"CNN's John Sutter looks at how brain imaging is helping us understand the human brain. Sutter: ""This is the greatest scientific quest of all time"" He says it could lead to new treatments for brain disorders like Alzheimer's and stroke. ""It's a very exciting time to be a scientist"""
" Functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase, producing a higher MRI response where neural activity goes up. The human mind and brain is not a single, general-purpose processor, but a collection of highly specialized components, each solving a different specific problem."
Brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything. All you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts. Today I want to tell you about a project being carried out by scientists across the world to paint a neural portrait of the human mind.
"To tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function, you need to mess with it and see what happens. The patient doesn't know where those electrodes are, and he's never heard of the face area. So with the patient's consent, the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain."
"Nancy Kanwisher: This experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only selectively responsive to faces but causally involved in face perception. She shows how the brain responds to images like these. Kanwishers: You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before, but somebody different."
"The brain is divided into two hemispheres: the left and the right. The left hemisphere contains regions that are involved in perception, vision and hearing. The right hemisphere contains areas that are responsible for complex mental processes. The brain is also divided into regions that respond to different senses."
"Scientists have found that certain regions of the brain respond selectively to language. These regions respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence, but not when you do other complex mental things. Scientists are trying to find other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions."
"Brain imaging has shown that these regions respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all. The brain could have been a single, general-purpose processor, more like a kitchen knife than a Swiss Army knife. Brain imaging has delivered this rich and interesting picture of the human mind."
"Google co-founder John Defterios wants to build the world's first underground park in New York City. The site is located at the heart of the Lower East Side, one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city. With diffusion imaging, you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain. With this method you can also trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain, potentially giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain."
The Lowline is a plan to use solar power to create green space in New York City. The project has attracted the attention of hundreds of thousands of people around the world. The plan is to use the power to plant trees and other plants in the area.
The Lowline is a new public space in New York City's East Village. The project is the work of a group of young people who want to open up the city to the rest of the world. They hope to create a space where people can come together and share their stories.
"Uldus is a photo-based artist from Russia. He started his way around six years ago with ironic self-portraits to lay open stereotypes about nationalities, genders, and social issues. ""I am Russian. I sell drugs, guns, porno with kids!"" he says."
"""Desperate Romantics"" is a new series on CNN.com. The series is based on paintings from the pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood in England in the mid-19th century. The project aims to inspire girls to fight for goals, for dreams, and change stereotypes."
"In 1975, only 30 percent of people lived outside EU and North America. Today it's 50/50. In 2020, it's 57 percent in the rest. And in 2035, the West is  outnumbered in the rich consumer market."
"Hans Rosling asks Swedish public how they think GDP per capita has changed since the Second World War. Fifty percent thought it had doubled, 38 percent said it's more or less the same, 12 said it had halved. Only 12 percent of the Swedes know this, says Rosling."
"Women in school has almost caught up with men, according to the U.S. public. In the majority of the world, where most people in the world live, most countries, girls today go to school as long as boys. That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved, not at all."
"In U.S., when we asked the public, only five percent got it right. There must be preconceived ideas, you know. Many in the rich countries, they think that we can never end extreme poverty. Of course they think so, because they don't even know what has happened."
"The world was two groups: the poor and the rich, with fewer in between. The lower humps merged with the upper hump, and we have a dromedary world with one hump only. The percent in poverty has decreased. Still it's appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty."
"CNN published the results on their web and they had the questions there, millions answered. Ola Rosling: You see, the problem is not that people don't read and listen to the media. The problem is that the media doesn't know themselves."
Hudiksvall is a city in northern Sweden. It's a neighborhood with a large problem. It has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods where you grew up as well. It gave me a very biased view of how life is on this planet.
"We use our intuition to make sense of the world, but it's not working. We need to measure what is the pattern of ignorance, and then we can fix it. We're trying to get to the bottom of the problem of extreme poverty in the world."
"The project aims to create a global knowledge certificate. The certificate can be used by large organizations, schools, universities, or news agencies. The project is based on a survey of the public's knowledge of 250 facts. The results of the survey are then used to create the certificate."
We need to turn our intuition into strength again. We need to be able to generalize. I'm going to show you some tricks where the misconceptions are turned around into rules of thumb. Let's start with the first misconception: Everything is getting worse.
"In 1900, there was about half a million people who died every year from natural disasters: floods, earthquakes, volcanic  eruption, whatever, droughts. The next preconceived idea is first countries and people need to be very, very rich to get the social development like girls in school."
"Mac Barnett is a best-selling author of children's books. He used to run a summer camp for four- to six-year-olds in Berkeley, California. Barnett: ""My job is that I lie to children, but they're honest lies"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a young girl about the power of art. He says it's not just kids who can get to that place. It's also adults. Sutter: ""Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is given us"""
"When he was a kid, I was obsessed with secret door novels, things like ""Narnia,"" where you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land. We know these characters aren't real, but we have real feelings about them, and we're able to do that. I think kids are the best audience for serious literary fiction."
"The Echo Park Time Travel Mart is a time travel store on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. ""Whenever you are, we're already then,"" is the store's motto. The store's employees include Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens and Charles Dickens."
"Schadenfreude is the store's biggest seller. The store also sells Viking Odorant, Axe Body Spray and robot emotion chips. It's a very special space, because it's this weird space in the front. There's a quarterly that's published with just writing done by the kids."
"The writer says he likes to break down the fourth wall in his books. He says he wants fiction to escape and come into the real world. ""I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions,"" he says. ""The joke isn't a joke"""
"Underneath the case is an ad that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial for a blue whale. You can just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope and we'll send you a whale. He's got a phone number, and you can call and leave him a message. He has to take it to school with him."
"Mac Barnett: Nico has left over 25 messages for Randolph over four years. Mac Barnett: The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art, at least the art of fiction, was, was working with kids. ""Nico's the best reader I could hope for,"" Randolph says."
"In 1960, still a student, I got a traveling fellowship to study housing in North America. Thirty years later, this is Beijing today. This is Hong Kong. If you're wealthy, you live there, if you're poor,you live there. With it, comes congestion, and we lose mobility, and so on."
"Habitat is realizing the quality of life of Habitat in real-life projects across Asia. The concept of outdoor and indoor, promenades and parks integrated with intense urban life. Public housing high-rise buildings in all major cities: New York, Philadelphia, Colombo."
"Habitat would be all about gardens, contact with nature, streets instead of corridors. We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy, and there it is almost 50 years later. It's now a heritage building, but it did not proliferate. China has become the world's second largest economy."
"Growth of China is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change, in the structure of the world economy. Just 25 years ago, the developing countries were, notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people, they accounted for only about a third of world's output."
"Climate change will transform the relationship between human beings and the planet, he says. The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do, he adds. We have to decide whether to do it well or badly, the economic, or structural, transformation."
"Cities are an opportunity which we can use or it's an opportunity we can lose. The cities that are going to be built — and there are many, and many big ones — we have to think of how to design them in a compact way so we can save travel time. The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia is a very important case."
"In the 1950s, the only way to get around Beijing was to walk. Now, the city's transport system has been reformed to make it easier for people to get to work and school. ""We have to invest in our cities, and we have to do it wisely,"" says the mayor."
"In the next five or six years, they will likely move from around 20 percent in renewables to over 33 percent. That would bring California back to where they were in 1990, a period when the economy would more or less have doubled. Not just California - the government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes of 400 million people."
"In the last decade, we've lost a forest area the size of Portugal. Forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species. They hold water in the soil and take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. In Brazil, the rate of deforestation has been reduced by 70 percent."
"From Beijing to London, from California to India, from Brazil to Ethiopia, we do understand how to manage those two transformations, the structural and the climate. But, and it's a big but, the world as a whole is moving far too slowly. We're not cutting emissions in the way we should."
"China is a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel, particularly coal. We need leaders to step up. We can have better growth, better climate, a better world. If we make a mess of it, we, you and me, if we don't manage those transformations properly, it will be the worst of centuries."
"Kenneth Cukier: Big data is important, and big data is new. The only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges is because of the effective use of data, he says. In 1908, on the island of Crete, archaeologists discovered a clay disc. They dated it from 2000 B.C., so it's 4,000 years old."
"Data has gone from a stock to a flow, from something stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic. The disc that was discovered off of Crete that's 4,000 years old, is heavy, it doesn't store a lot of information, and that information is unchangeable."
Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti-theft device in cars. The idea is that the car recognizes that a non-approved driver is behind the wheel. The car senses that the person slumps into that position and sets an internal alarm.
"In the 1950s, a computer scientist at IBM liked to play checkers, so he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won, because the computer only knew what a legal move was. But Arthur Samuel knew something else. He wrote a small sub-program alongside it operating in the background."
"Machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online. It will improve our lives, but there are problems that we need to be conscious of. The police may use big data for their purposes, a little bit like ""Minority Report"""
"Big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar, professional knowledge work in the 21st century. The Industrial Revolution wasn't very good if you were a horse. We are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect. It's not just a problem for the National Security Agency."
"Big data is going to transform how we live, how we work and how we think. It's a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire. Businesses collect lots of data, and they misuse it too, and we need to get better at this, and this will take time."
"""I felt like I was in the middle of a war,"" says Palestinian photographer. ""I was in a war zone and I was trying to get out of the war zone,"" she says. ""It was like I had to fight my way out of it"""
"An EMT in New York told a man he was going to die and that there was nothing he could do for him. The man simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face. The patient simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes, I saw inner peace and acceptance."
"The dying need to know that their life had meaning, says Dr. John. ""I wish I had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time,"" he says. ""There's a need for immortality within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones, myself, my crew, or anyone around"""
"""I was afraid if I told them the truth, that they would die in fear,"" she says. ""It's the littlest things that give you peace in those final moments,"" she adds. ""Some of us won't make it."""
"There are 2.5 billion people in the world who don't have access to adequate sanitation. The United Nations estimates that every year, there are 1.5 million child deaths because of inadequate sanitation. To avoid open defecation, cities and cities build infrastructure, like pit latrines."
"In schools, children defecate on the floors and then leave a trail outside the building and start defecating around the building. In some countries, like India, the lower castes are condemned to empty the pits, and they're further condemned by society. We have to rethink sanitation, and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure."
"The idea is to create a system that can be used to collect waste. The waste can then be used in a variety of ways, such as as fertilizer. The idea is that the waste can be recycled and used for other purposes. The goal is to make the process easier for people."
"CNN's Richard Quest says access to adequate sanitation is a basic human right. Quest: ""We need to stop the practice of lower castes and lower-status people going down and being condemned to empty pits"" ""She deserves our support surely, because whether by subway, mule, or canoe, she is teaching us to walk the walk"""
"The Latin American Medical School opened in Havana, Cuba, in 1999. Students come from 83 countries in the Americas, Africa and Asia. They come from 100 ethnic groups, speak 50 different languages. More than half the students are young women."
"Havana's Latin American Medical School is the largest medical school in the world. It has graduated 23,000 young doctors since its first class of 2005, with nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline. Doctors are concentrated in the cities, where only half the world's people live, not in shantytowns or South L.A."
"The U.S. is the number one destination for medical students in the world. The students learn to work in teams, with a dose of humility. They also learn how to deal with the challenges of living in a poor country. They learn about the importance of community service, and how to help others."
"Haitian medical students flew in from Cuba to help build health system in Haiti. ELAM's graduates are smart, strong and also dedicated. Dozens of new health centers have been built, staffed, in 35 cases, headed by ELAM graduates."
Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world. Many of its doctors have left the country to work in the U.S. and other countries. They need to be able to return to their home countries and find work.
"Women represent 50 percent of middle management and professional positions. But women at the top of organizations represent not even a third of that number. To move forward, we may have to find our way back to that pediatrician who would knock on my family's door on the South Side of Chicago."
"Tonya Ehrlich: Why are there so many women mired in the middle and what has to happen to take them to the top? She says there's a notable absence of advice that relates to business, strategic and financial acumen. She says much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take, like become more assertive."
"Women make up 50 percent of the workforce in the U.S., but only 33 percent of senior positions. Expert: Traditional advice to women in 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top. Women must show they understand their businesses, where they're headed, and their role in taking it there."
"Only 37 percent of executives believe they have strategic alignment in place. For 63 percent of organizations, achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable. It's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women. It is important for women and men to examine the mindsets we hold about careers and success."
"The keyboardist has been playing music by George Frideric Handel for the past two years. He says he fell in love with the music and wanted to share it with as many people as possible. ""It was an experience of being totally in awe of the music, and I had not felt that in a long time"""
"Daria van den Bercken plays music for children as young as seven years old. She says the children are always in a ""state of wonder"" about the music she plays. ""They are in this constant state of wonder, and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening"""
"Every cell produces waste as a byproduct, and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve. Galen proposed that while we're awake, our brain's motive force, its juice, would flow out to all the other parts of the body, animating them but leaving the brain all dried up."
"The fluid and the waste from inside the brain don't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of CSF. Instead, there is a specialized network of plumbing that organizes and facilitates this process. But our most surprising finding was that all of this, with all this fluid rushing through the brain, it's only happening in the sleeping brain. When the brain goes to sleep, the brain cells themselves seem to shrink, opening up spaces in between them."
"New research shows that sleep clears amyloid-beta, a protein that's made in the brain all the time. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, the protein builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain's cells, instead of being cleared away. This buildup is thought to be one of the key steps in the development of the disease."
"Sleep may be an elegant design solution to some of the brain's most basic needs, according to new research. ""We're moving towards a new model of the state and society,"" says the author. ""No taxation without representation,"" can now be updated to ""No representation without a conversation,"" he adds."
David Frum: We need to talk about the future of democracy. He says it's not just a matter of voting once every couple of years. Frum says we need to find a way to build a democracy that works in the 21st century.
"DemocracyOS is an open-source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives. Users can get informed so every new project that gets introduced in Congress gets immediately translated and explained in plain language. And finally, you can vote how you would like your elected  representative to vote."
"El Partido de la Red, or the Net Party, is a political party in Buenos Aires. The party was founded in August last year and ran for elections in October last year. It aims to change the way political parties make their decisions."
"Argentina's Congress is launching for the first time in Argentina's history, a DemocracyOS. GG: Our political system can be transformed, and not by subverting it, but by rewiring it with the tools that Internet affords us now."
"Glenn Greenwald: ""I look at this as work that will never end until governments around the world are no longer able to subject entire populations to monitoring and surveillance"" ""To me, that's the way that privacy can be rejuvenated. That's the essence of journalism,"" he says."
LZ Granderson: People who say they don't care about their privacy are lying. He says they think they're doing nothing wrong and have no reason to be concerned. Granderson says people who are concerned about privacy should check their own accounts.
"All of us have things that we don't want anyone else to know about. The reason is that when we're in a state where we can be monitored, our behavior changes. Human shame is a very powerful motivator, as is the desire to avoid it."
"In ""1984,"" Winston Smith describes the surveillance system that they faced. Smith: ""You had to live, did live, from habit that became instinct, in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard"" A society in which people can be monitored at all times is a society that breeds conformity and obedience and submission."
"Voter turnout around the world peaked in the late '80s, and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before. In the last two years, two of the world's most consolidated, oldest democracies, the U.S. and France, held nationwide municipal elections."
"Rio de Janeiro is one of the most unequal cities in the world. The Human Development Index of Leblon is higher than Norway, Switzerland or Sweden. Rio is a place where you can go from northern Europe to sub-Saharan Africa in 30 minutes."
"The U.S. population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the past three decades. The American way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many, many American cities. We need a participation revolution, and we need it fast."
"Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Campos is the founder of Meu Rio. He says the city needs to do a better job of engaging its citizens. Campos: ""We don't need to wait for governments to do this work for us"""
"Rio de Janeiro has no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases. The Our Cities network hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities. We have already started doing it in São Paulo with incredible results, and want to take it to cities around the world."
"Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children's lives. It can save over 600,000 children every year. Four out of five people don't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet."
"In 90 percent of households in India, you will find soap. Even in countries where soap is the lowest, like Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent. Children pick up disease in the place that's supposed to love them and protect them."
"Every second in Asia and Africa, 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family. The Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England to combat cholera. 6.6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday."
"On October 15, we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day. The day is a celebration of the world's most important public health intervention. Most of these deaths are preventable, and that doesn't just make me sad, it makes me angry. The budget is not always there. The private sector can make a huge difference."
Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five. We run the world's largest handwashing program by any public health standards. We've reached over 183 million people in 16 countries. My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020.
"Handwashing can reduce the risk of cancer by up to 50%. Hand washing has been shown to have a positive effect on cancer prevention. Hand washing can also help prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the body, such as the lungs and liver."
"MicroRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression. Unlike DNA, which is mainly fixed, microRNAs can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions. abnormal microRNA expression levels creates a unique, specific pattern for each type of cancer. This pattern reflects the progression of the disease, and whether it's responding to medication."
A new way to detect cancer is being developed. It uses a 3D-printed microchip that can detect cancer cells in real-time. The technology is being trialled in the U.S. and will be rolled out to other countries.
"You don't need to have any symptoms to detect cancer. You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools. Today, cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear. That is, at stage 3 or 4, and I believe that is too late."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at a project to understand how people talk about quitting smoking. Sutter: Technology has brought us so much: the moon landing, the Internet, the ability to sequence the human genome. But it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears, Sutter says. The project is a fantastic example of courage in the face of a sea of irrelevance."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about his son's autism diagnosis. Sutter: ""Facts are stubborn things, but sometimes they're stupid, too"" He says his son found a way to communicate by typing a word in a Google search box. ""It helped us change our frame of reference"""
"The Internet, blamed for everything, right? Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture. The term ""refrigerator mother"" was actually the original hypothesis for the cause of autism. The humanities and sociology, and the social sciences, give us context for big data."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the power of big data and the challenges of interpreting it. Sutter: ""We are not passive consumers of data and technology. No. It's science, not magic. We shape the role it plays in our lives and the way we make meaning from it"""
"""I want to dedicate the rest of my life to making Africa great,"" says Nelson Mandela. Mandela: ""It's all because of leadership. One man, President Mugabe, is almost single-handedly responsible for having destroyed this country"" ""Africa needs a new generation of leaders,"" says Mandela."
"In Africa, more than anywhere else in the world, the difference that just one good leader can make is much greater than anywhere  else. It's because in Africa, we have weak institutions, like the judiciary, the constitution, civil society and so forth."
"African leaders make the most difference on the continent. The good news is that the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving. ""For the first time Africa's growing, and in  fact it's the second fastest growing economic region in the world"""
"Africa has the fastest growing population in the world. By 2050, it will have the largest workforce in the globe. The continent needs to invest in its future and create jobs for the future. The next generation of leaders must do more than just talk."
"Erick Rajaonary quit his job as a chartered accountant and started a company to manufacture fertilizer from the bat droppings. Today, Erick has built a business that generates several million dollars of revenue, and he employs 70 people full time and another 800 people during the season."
"The African Leadership Academy has been running for the last 10 years. Over the next 50 years, it expects to create 6,000 transformative leaders for the continent. The academy will have 25 campuses in Africa, each with 10,000 leaders at a time."
"Nelson Mandela once said, ""Every now and then, a generation is called upon to be great. You can be that great generation"" I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate the next generation of African leaders, then this generation four that is coming up will be the greatest that Africa and indeed the entire world has ever seen."
"GiveDirectly is the first organization dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor. A sender can pay a 1.6 percent fee and with the click of a button send money directly to a recipient's account. GiveDirectly has sent cash to 35,000 people across rural Kenya and Uganda in one-time payments."
"The more cash we give to the poor, and the more evidence we have that it works, the more we have to reconsider everything else we give. Organizations would have to prove that they're doing more good for the poor than the poor can do for themselves. The logic behind aid is too often, well, we do at least some good."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the idea of an unconditional cash transfer. Economists call it an unconditionalcash transfer, and it's exactly that: It's cash given with no strings attached. Governments in developing countries have been doing this for decades. Sutter: With more evidence and new technology, it's possible to make this a model for delivering aid."
"In New Zealand, Dr. Lianne Parkin and her team tested an old tradition in her city. The tradition is that in the winter, in that city, you wear your socks on the outside of your boots. The results were quite graphic when they saw it, and it's true."
"The Ig Nobel Prize for Literature is given out every year to people who have made a difference to the world. The winner is chosen by a panel of judges, and the winner is announced at the end of the year. The prize is given to the person who has made the greatest contribution to the field of literature."
"You get an Ig Nobel prize. The design is different every year. Most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash, some money. The other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony, which happens at Harvard University. It fits 1,100 people, it's jammed to the gills."
"The winners are kept secret until that moment, even the Nobel laureates who will shake their hand don't know who they are until they're announced. A team of doctors in Europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies, one way or another. The child comes flying out through centrifugal force."
Dr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere that in an emergency can be quickly separated into a pair of protective face masks. Dr. Bodnar was one of the doctors who treated victims of the Chernobyl power plant meltdown. She was always thinking after that about could there be some simple mask that was available everywhere when the unexpected happens.
"CNN's John Defterios goes to the bottom of the sea to find a new home for the crew of the Aquarius. The crew is trying to build a log cabin to live in for the rest of their lives. Defterio: ""If we're going to explore the final frontier on this planet, we need to live there"""
"The team was able to study sharks and grouper in aggregations that they've never seen before. They were also able to commune with animals that are much larger than us, such as the endangered goliath grouper. ""It's like seeing dogs and  cats behaving well together,"" says expedition leader."

"The Fotokite is a five kilogram device with an SLR under it. It is flown by the Kwikwasut'inuxw, a tribe from Vancouver, Canada. The ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities, all animals are one, has been a powerful inspiration to me."
"""It's just difficult to come up with common sense laws to regulate flying cameras,"" he says. The other problem is regulations, or rather, the lack of good regulation. ""It's a bit uncomfortable to fly, probably also for the operator,"" he adds."
"The Fotokite is a quadrocopter with a dog leash. It's like a personal flying pet, says the project's creator. ""It just always maintains a certain angle to you, and if I move around with it, it'll actually follow me naturally,"" he says."
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unveiled a camera that can be controlled from the air. Putin says the device is safe and easy to use. He says he plans to show the public how to use the camera on stage. The camera can also be used to take pictures of people in the sky.
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a group of photographers who flew flying cameras as a hobby. Sutter: ""You can really see the scale of this event — just the number of people, the colors, the banners"" ""I think, in the future, journalism and many other professions, there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there"""
"Cancer is about feelings and faith and losing and finding your identity, she says. It's about realizing that the most important things in life are not things at all, but relationships. ""The only reason I did not kill him with my bare hands was because I could not lift my right arm"""
"The way to cope with trauma, with loss, with any life-changing experience is to find meaning. No one can tell us what our experience means. We have to decide what it means. Meaning can be quiet and introverted. Maybe we make one small decision about our lives that can bring about big change."
"""I don't really have any friends,"" he says. ""So what?"" ""I'm going to make friends"" ""And I will,"" he adds. ""I will make friends with you"" ""You are my friend,"" she says, ""and I will be your friend"""

"CNN's John Defterios talks to the leaders of Colombia's guerrillas. He says the government wanted to demobilize as many of the rebels as possible. Defterio: ""We didn't know very much about it. If you live in the cities, you don't really understand it"""
"He was recruited when he was 17, and sometime later, in his squadron, if you will, this beautiful girl was recruited, and they fell in love. But it turns out that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla, so their romance was discovered and they were separated. He walked for two days and two nights, and he got out, and the only thing he wanted was to see her."
"The FARC guerrillas have been fighting in Colombia for more than 50 years. The Colombian government is trying to bring peace to the country. The government put up a Christmas tree in the capital, Bogota, to encourage demobilization. The FARC responded by saying they don't walk anymore and use rivers."
"Most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages. We sent thousands of these down the rivers, and then picked them up later if they weren't. This generated, on average, a demobilization every six hours, so this was incredible."
"""We are saving a place for you,"" the ad says. ""I don't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do, but what I do know is that our work may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization"""
"Housing crisis in Chile is one of the biggest in the world, with more than 220,000 people displaced. Housing crisis is a problem that can only be solved by building new homes, says housing minister. ""The more complex the problem, the more the need for simplicity,"" says Hernández."
"Designers are trying to give an answer to the ""3S"" menace, scale, speed, and scarcity. The key question is, which half of a good house do we do? They wanted to do with public money the half that families won't  be able to do individually."
"We wanted to have the right light, with the right temperature, and the right air. It's a collection of floors, one on top of each other, with a core in the center. When you have an open atrium, you are able to see what others are doing from within."
"Sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common sense. You don't require sophisticated programming. By 2030, out of the five billion people that will be living in cities, two billion are going to be under the line of poverty."
"Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able to read the subtitles, but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie, romantic, let's-all-dream-together-about- the-future-of-the-city kind of thing. It is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer."
"Dre Urhahn: ""Design's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities, which is not money but coordination"" ""We were able to save four million dollars, and  that is why the forest is today under construction,"" he says."
A Brazilian artist has painted a kite in the shape of a river. The artist wanted to show the effect of the river on the kite. The kite was painted in the same color as the river in the project's name. The project was a success.
"Jeroen Koolhaas and his team spent almost an entire year painting a river in Vila Cruzeiro, Rio de Janeiro. During that time, another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs. They learned that during those times, people in communities really stick together during these times of hardship."
"The project took almost two years to complete. More than 1,500 people put together and donated over 100,000 dollars. The city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment. The project was funded through a crowd-funding campaign."
"Houses are being plastered in Vila Cruzeiro, Brazil. The project was inspired by the idea that people should work together to build a community. The idea has spread to other parts of the world, including the U.S. and Holland."
"Ethan Zuckerman: U.S. is leading the world in reforming marijuana policies. He says it's time to legally regulate and tax marijuana more or less like alcohol. Most politicians in my country want to roll back the Drug War now, he says."
"In the late 19th century, when most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal, the principal consumers of opiates were middle-aged white women. The first drug prohibition laws in California and Nevada were driven by racist fears of Chinese transforming white women into opium-addicted sex slaves. The reason some drugs are legal and others not has almost nothing to do with science or health."
"The U.S. has less than five percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of its prison population. ""It's my country's history with alcohol prohibition and Al Capone, times 50,"" says John Sutter. Sutter: Legalizing marijuana would reduce crime, violence, corruption and black markets."
"CNN's John Sutter: Will more people use marijuana? Maybe, but it's not going to be young people. He says people in their 40s and 60s and 80s may prefer a little marijuana to other drugs. Portugal treats addiction as a health issue, he says. Sutter says half of all people who were addicted to cigarettes have quit."
"The obstacles to reform lie not just out there in the power of the prison industrial complex or other vested interests, but within each and every one of us. The War on Drugs gets justified as one great big child protection act, which any young person can tell you it's not. It's a subterfuge for advancing the realpolitik interests of the U.S."
"Ethan Nadelmann: The Drug War did  nothing to protect their kids. The National: How can we use computers, cameras, microphones to represent the world in an alternative way, as much as possible? Vincent Moon: We wanted to create another type of intimacy using all those new technologies."
"Filmmaker and music producer has spent five years traveling around the world to make his films. His films include music videos, documentaries and interviews with musicians and artists. He says he was traveling alone with a backpack, camera, microphones in it."
"In Peru, they drink pisco sour. In Chechnya, I was there to research on Sufi rituals. I would publish them online for free under a Creative Commons license, but I would also give them to the people and I would let them do  what they want with it."
"""I was still  keeping this idea in mind: What's the point? I was trying to get closer to a certain origin of it. We wanted to represent the music we love, the musicians we admired, as much as possible, far from the music industry"""
"""I think we are recording to regain a certain complexity,"" says the photographer.

"Vincent van Gogh's new project, ""Híbridos,"" is based in Brazil. Van Gogh: ""I really believe Brazil, far from the cliches, is the greatest religious country in the world"" He says Brazil is ""the greatest country in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities"""
Naná Vasconcelos: The first patient to ever be treated with an antibiotic was a policeman in Oxford. He explains how antibiotics have been used in large quantities sub-therapeutically to make chicken and hogs grow faster. He says the massive use of antibiotics around the world has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria.
"The problem of antibiotic resistance is a global issue affecting both rich and poor countries. If I misuse antibiotics or I use antibiotics, not only am I affected but  others are affected as well. The costs I impose on others through global climate change go everywhere, and I don't necessarily take these costs into consideration."
"We need to slow the pace of co-evolution with the bacteria. We have drug discovery processes, screening molecules, and FDA regulatory process. We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well. There are clean energy subsidies, which are to switch to fuels that don't pollute as much."
"The cost of penicillin per day is about 10 cents. The government is now considering ways of subsidizing new antibiotics and development. Other alternative technologies that people are working on include bacteriophages, probiotics, quorum sensing, synbiotics."
"The world depends on one drug, artemisinin drugs, essentially to treat malaria. If this were to become widespread, that puts at risk the single drug that we have to  treat malaria around the world. The alternative is a world in which even a blade of grass is a potentially lethal weapon."
My mother was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer. She lost her address book and tried to find her doctor on the Internet. She was told she should be fired and sent back to her own country. She decided to stay and fight for her life.
"""When it comes to medicine, having that trust is a must, and when that trust has been lost, then all that's left is fear"" ""What I saw behind every excuse was deep fear, and what I learned was that to become a doctor, we have to put on our white coats and hide behind it"""
"The more we know, the less we need to fear. We need to be afraid of what we don't know. The more we fear, the more we want to know. It's a vicious cycle. The fear of not knowing is the fear of knowing what we are doing."
People understand health care to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors. People want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice. Participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just where we went to medical school and what specialty we're in.
"Doctors should be able to tell their patients where they get their money from, says author. ""I find it an invasion of my privacy to tell my patients where I get my money from,"" says a doctor in New York. ""We need to make it clear that we're here to help people, not to exploit them,"" says another doctor."
"Wen: ""This is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory"" ""I'm American and I'm already here,"" she says. ""Let us patients decide what's important when we're choosing a doctor"" ""Over 300 doctors have taken the total transparency pledge,"" Wen says."
"In China, patients can ask their doctors to let them die. This was the norm in the U.S. as well. But the sickness of fear has taken over, and patients suffer the consequences, says the doctor. ""It's not that new of a concept at all,"" the doctor says."
"Doctors need to be more open with patients about their work, says Dr. David Perry. Perry: ""We can bridge the disconnect between what doctors do and what patients need. We can get there, because we know that transparency gets us to that trust"""
"In 1934, Dr. Sam Kuznets delivered a report to the U.S. Congress on the state of the economy. The report helped policy makers find a way out of the Great Depression. Kuznet's report was found to be so useful, it spread around the world."
GDP is a tool to help us measure economic performance. It's not a measure of our well-being. And it shouldn't be a guide to all decision making. We live in a world where GDP is the benchmark of success in a global economy.
"The Social Progress Index is a measure of a person's well-being. The index is based on three questions: Do I have enough food, water and shelter? And do I have a chance to pursue my dreams and ambitions? The index was created to help people understand their needs and aspirations."
"The Social Progress framework is based on 12 indicators. These include rights, freedom of choice, freedom from discrimination and access to the world's most advanced knowledge. New Zealand is the country with the highest social progress, according to the framework. It is followed by the United States, the UK, Australia and Canada."
"The country with the least social progress, I'm sorry to say, is Chad. The highest ranked G7 country is Canada. The United States is considerably richer than New Zealand, but with a lower level of social progress. Senegal has a higher level of  social progress than Chad, but same level of GDP."
"Gross domestic product (GDP) and social progress, according to a new report. The report shows that for poor countries, the curve is really steep. It shows that if poor countries can get a little bit of extra GDP, there's a lot of social progress bang for your GDP buck."
"With more and more of the world's population living on this part of the curve, it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development. Earlier this year, with our friends from the Imazon  nonprofit here in Brazil, we launched the first subnational  Social Progress Index."
"TEDx speaker: GDP has defined and shaped our lives for the last 80 years. You can create a Social Progress Index for any state, region, city or municipality. We did it for the Amazon region. With this detailed information, Imazon and other partners can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people's lives."
"The way that we work has changed dramatically over the last few years. A well-run meeting can yield really positive, actionable results. "" MAS"" is a self-inflicted wound, he says. ""I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic"""
The video is still getting thousands of views every month. Some of the biggest companies in the world have asked for permission to use the video in their new-hire training to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting. The video has been viewed more than a million times.
"A common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief that we are powerless to do anything other than go to meetings. But the truth is, we're not powerless at all. In fact, the cure for MAS is right here in our hands."
"Every day, we allow our coworkers, who are otherwise very,  very nice people, to steal from us. And I'm talking about something far  more valuable than office furniture. In fact, we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS: Mindless Accept Syndrome."
"Autism is an ability rather than a disability, according to the teenager. He says he has a very vivid imagination. When his imagination takes hold, his body takes on a life of its own, he says. But he says school can be a problem, as he has to explain his world to teachers."
"People tend to diagnose autism with really specific  check-box descriptions. It can be that people don't want to associate with anyone who can't fit into a box. So if people want to be these things, why are so many people striving to be normal?"
"Autistic writer and presenter Emma Watson is writing a book about her experiences with autism. She says stereotypes about the condition are often wrong. Watson: ""Why not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination?"" ""I wouldn't trade my autism and my imagination for the world,"" she says."
"Pete Frates was diagnosed with autism at the age of 18. His mother, Tracey, says her son has given her many gifts. She says he has also given her a mission in life. ""I'm going to save my son, and if it doesn't happen in time for him"""
"""I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry,"" he says. ""It's not a broken wrist, it's not an infection. It's just a wrist that's not working properly"" ""I just want to know what's wrong with my wrist,"" the man says."
"Pete Frate was diagnosed with ALS at the age of 25. He and his family were told there was no treatment or cure. Pete's family and friends rallied around him to raise money for research. To date, the ALS Association has raised 125 million dollars."
"""It just doesn't seem like there's a whole  lot of collaboration going on here,"" he says. ""We were supposed to  have therapies overseas, and the rug was  pulled out from under us"" ""For the next two years, we just watched my son be taken away from me, little by little every day"""
"On July 4th, 2014, 75th year of Lou Gehrig's inspirational speech comes, and Pete is asked by MLB.com to write an article in the Bleacher Report. Twenty days later,  the ice started to fall. On July 27th, Pete's  roommate in New York City, wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt, ""I'm taking the ALS  Ice Bucket Challenge,"" picked up the ice, put it over his head."
"""We knew awareness  would lead to funding, we just didn't know it would only take a couple of days"" ""We put our best  501(c)(3)s on Pete's website, and off we went"" ""It was interesting. My husband did Japanese television. It's absolutely fantastic"""
"The ALS Association, they think by year end, it'll be 160 million dollars. YouTube has reported that over 150 countries have posted Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS. They had a clinical trial for a drug that they've been developing. It was on a three-year track for funding."
"Pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his  teammates in the dugout. He hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages. He said, ""I just don't feel  I'm living up to my potential. I don't feeling this is my mission in life"""
"The extracellular matrix is different from every part of the body. The matrix is responsible for all wound healing, so if you imagine cutting the body, you actually have to rebuild this very complex ECM in order to get it to form again. So when I was a freshman at NYU, what I discovered was you could actually take small pieces of plant-derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound."
"Gel is able to stop a bleed in less than three minutes. It then reassembles into local tissue. The technology will be in the hands of doctors within the next year, he says. ""We have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work,"" he adds."
"Some people, some Americans, think photographs like these best reflect how Obama really looks. 89 percent of these people voted for McCain. How could it be that when I look at a person, an object, or an event, I see something very different than somebody else does?"
"Social psychologist Dr. Michael Bociurkiw is fascinated by people who don't see eye to eye. He says perception is a subjective experience, and that's how we end up seeing through our own mind's eye. The amount of information that we can see is the equivalent of the surface area of our thumb on our outstretched arm."
Researchers measured waist-to-hip ratio and asked people to walk to a finish line. People who were out of shape and unfit saw the distance to the finish line as significantly greater than people who were in better shape. People's states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment.
"Survey: Unfit individuals saw the distance as farther, saw the finish line as farther away, than people who were in better shape. People who had committed to a manageable goal that they could accomplish in the near future and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal saw the exercise as easier."
"""Keep  your eyes on the prize"" is an actual directive for how to look around your environment. People who used this strategy saw the finish line as 30 percent closer than people who looked around as they naturally would. ""We thought this was great. We were really excited because it meant that this strategy helped make the exercise look easier"""
"People who kept their eyes on the prize actually moved 23 percent faster than people who looked around naturally. People who did the exercise required 17 percent less exertion than those who did it naturally. The exercise was moderately challenging but not impossible, like most exercises that improve our fitness."
"What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye. We might see the world in a different way, and sometimes that might not line up with reality, but it doesn't mean that one of us is right and one of we is wrong."
"Western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised, but there's plenty of holes in it. Western treatment are injections of antimony, which are painful, expensive, and not good for your heart. The fact is that these people can sometimes, sometimes,sometimes cure things we cannot."
"Loren McIntyre, the discoverer of the Amazon, was lost on the Peru-Brazil border. He was rescued by a group of  isolated Indians called the Matsés. McIntyre: ""These people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do"""
"The rainforest has been called the  greatest expression of life on Earth. But as you all know, it's rapidly disappearing. This is a $4 billion industry based on venom from a Brazilian snake, and the Brazilians did not get a nickel. It's not an acceptable way of doing business."
"Top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs, bottom half carbon in the atmosphere where it's driving climate change. The number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere is forest destruction. The greatest and most endangered species in the Amazon Rainforest is not the jaguar, it's not the harpy eagle."
"CNN's John Defterios goes to the Amazon to meet some of the world's most isolated people. He finds a group of people who have left their mark on the forest with stone carvings. Defterio: ""They know we exist, they know there's an outside world. They have chosen to remain isolated"""
"At the turn of the last century was the rubber trade. The demand for natural rubber, which came from the Amazon, set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush. It was a mad race to get that rubber, and the man on the left, Julio Arana, is one of the true thugs of the story."
"The Colombian Amazon is bigger than the state of Maryland. It's home to three isolated tribes and over 200,000 pre-Colombian art paintings. The Amazon's a big forest, and Brazil's got a big part of it, but not all of it."
"In the past, this is why you didn't mess with isolated Indians. But the world is changing. There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes. We see illegal logging coming from the south. And in Peru, there's a very nasty business."
"It's called human safaris. They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture. We've done this now with over 30 tribes, mapped, managed and increased protection of over 70 million acres of ancestral rainforest. So this allows the Indians to take control of their environmental and cultural destiny."
"Using automatic weapons to slaughter uncontacted peoples is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today, and it has to stop. Let's live in a world where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs."
"The labor supply in Germany will go down in Germany, and will be much smaller in 2030. Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly. Eight million people are missing, more than 20 percent of our current workforce. Germany has to significantly increase migration, get many more women in the workforce."
"By 2030, we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies, including three out of the four BRIC countries. China, with its former one-child policy, will be hit, as well as Brazil and Russia. The next thing we looked into was robots, automation, technology."
"Technology will replace a lot of jobs, regular jobs. Even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced by robots, artificial intelligence, big data, or automation. The key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs, but when, how fast, and to what extent."
"In 1980, less than 10 percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts. Today, this number is more than 30 percent and it will grow to more than 50 percent by 2030. More than 60 percent of these 200,000 job seekers are willing to work abroad."
"The least mobile countries are Russia, Germany and the U.S. Number seven is Australia, where 28 percent could imagine moving. The top priority worldwide is being appreciated for your work. People are looking for recognition in their jobs, the report says."
"Global workforce crisis consists of overall labor shortage plus a huge skill mismatch, plus a big cultural challenge. Right now, we are just at the turning point. Every company, but also every country, needs a people strategy, and to act on it immediately."
"A veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo called a cardiologist about a chimpanzee with a facial droop. The procedure was identical to one performed on a human patient, with the exception of the paw and the tail. The call was a wake-up call for the cardiologist, who had studied evolutionary biology."
"CNN's John Sutter talks to a group of doctors who are trying to find the cause of heart disease. Sutter says the problem is that we don't see ourselves as being different from other people. He says we are all suffering from the same disease, but we are not the same person."
"Some human patients  harm themselves. Some pluck out patches of hair, others actually cut themselves. How many human lives might have been saved if this knowledge had been put into the hands of E.R. docs and cardiologists? The gulf between our fields remains large."
"Some physicians can be snobs about doctors who are not M.D.'s. ""It's time for us physicians to embrace our patients' and our own animal natures,"" he says. Some of the best and  most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human."
"Three months of protests resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead and many more missing. Snipers, loyal to the government, started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street. As the days passed in Kiev's central square, streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands."
"The death toll stands around 3,000, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Most women cried when I photographed them. The color of their pastel coats, their shiny handbags, and the bunches of red carnations, white tulips and yellow roses jarred with the blackened square and the men encamped there."
"CNN's John Defterios takes a look back at the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. The protests were sparked by President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to withdraw from the European Union. Defterio: ""What I was witnessing was not only news, but also history"""
"Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story, and we think that we can continue doing it, not too often, once or twice a year, so we keep the feeling of an event. When people smile, it might be a very good slow idea, so after all, life is best when it's a bit strange."
Al Jazeera's Listening Post has been on the air since November 2009. The show was interrupted in September due to a signal failure at the last station. 1.2 million Norwegians watched part of the show on NRK2.
"The Norwegian media in a nutshell: not much drama. NRK decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven-hour train ride. The coastal ship journey Hurtigruten from Bergen to Kirkenes, almost 3,000 kilometers, covers most of Norway's coast."
"A new kind of reality TV show was born, and it goes against all the rules of TV engagement. In June 2011, 23 of us went on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship and we set off. The Norwegians, more than a million of them according to the ratings, loved it."
"Norwegian broadcaster NRK turned a conference room on board the Hurtigruten into a complete TV control room. It made it possible for them to take close-up pictures of people 100 kilomteres away, like this one. They also could take pictures. of people waving at us, people along the route, thousands of them, and they all had a phone in their hand."
"Hurtigruten was selected to be part of the Norwegian UNESCO list of documents. It's also in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest documentary ever. 3.2 million Norwegians watched part of this program, and we are only five million here."
"The Colbert Report is a weekly look at the news of the day. This week, we look at a new series, The Colbert Report, on CNN.com/soulmatestories. Next up, we'll look at some of the most popular shows of all time."
"Slow TV takes the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time. Viewer gets the feeling of actually being on the train, on the boat, and knitting together with others. Thomas Hellum: This is so completely different to other TV programming."
"Mike Katz-Lacabe asked his local police department for information about the plate reader data they had on him. The police department had photographs that captured where he was going and  often who he was with. The reason it's happening is because, as the cost of storing this data has plummeted, the police departments simply hang on to it."
"NSA-style mass surveillance is enabling local police departments to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each and every one of us. The government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors. Local police departments can be governed by the city councils, which can pass laws requiring police to dispose of the data."
"Rio de Janeiro is a very heterogenous city in a way that Baltimore or San Francisco is not. You still have the lobe of people involved with government, newspapers, politics, columnists. But then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music."
"Rio de Janeiro is one of the most multicultural cities in the world. The city has a population of more than 1.5 million people. It is home to a large number of different races, cultures and ethnicities. A new map shows the relationships between people in the city."
"CNN's John Sutter explores the different communities in Baltimore. Sutter: ""We see the same people over and over again, but that's because we're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city"" ""There's something that connects the two communities together, and that's sports,"" Sutter says."
"CNN's Al Sharpton says we need to do more to help young people. Sharpton: ""We've been schooled in them as well. We need to change that"" He offers three ideas to help change the way we think about young men and women."
"Diversity expert: ""I lean on a bias that I didn't even know that I had"" ""I want a guy. That's my default. Men are my default,"" she says. ""If you ask me explicitly, I would say, ""Female pilot: awesome."" But it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome, a little risky"""
"Five million people have taken the implicit association test, which measures unconscious bias. When people are shown images of black men and white men, we are more quickly able to associate that picture with a positive word. When we see a black face, it is easier for us to connect black with negative."
"Scientists say we should not think about color blindness. Instead, they say, stare at awesome black people. The problem was never that we saw color. It was what we did when we saw the color. The other possibility in science is that if you stick a white person who is odious that you know, and stick it up next to a person of color, a black person, who is fabulous, then that sometimes actually causes us to disassociate."
"CNN's Nina dos Santos: ""It's not the hardest thing to do, but it's also one of these things where you have to be conscious  and intentional about it"" ""I think black guys generally know where they're going. I don't know why exactly I think that, but that's what I think,"" she says."

CNN's Richard Quest gives his top three mathematically verifiable tips for love. He believes that mathematics is so powerful that it has the potential to offer us a new way of looking at almost anything. He says that love is full of patterns and mathematics is all about the study of patterns.
"The more attractive you are, the more messages you get on an online dating website. A study by mathematicians has found that the more attractive a person is, the less messages he or she gets. The study also found that people who are more attractive than others are more likely to get more messages."
"If you ask people how attractive they thought Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were, and you ask them to give them a score between one and five they'd average out to have roughly the same score. But the way that people would vote would be very different. Portia's scores would all be clustered around the four because everybody agrees that she's very beautiful, whereas Sarah Jessica Parker completely divides opinion."
"How do you know when it's time to settle down? Here are some tips to help you out. If you're looking for a partner, don't be afraid to pick someone who isn't like you. Don't be scared to pick a person who's not like you, even if they're not attractive."
"Peter says he should reject everyone in his first 37 percent of dating window. Then, he says, pick the next person that comes along that is better than everybody that you've seen before. He says this is the best possible way of finding the perfect partner."
"There are certain types of fish which employ this exact strategy. They reject every possible suitor that turns up in the first 37 percent of the mating season. I think this is conclusive proof, if ever it were needed, that everybody's brains are prewired to be a little bit mathematical."
"One in two marriages in the U.S. ends in divorce, according to a new study. Researchers recorded every aspect of a couple's conversation. They were able to predict if a couple was going to get divorced with 90 per cent accuracy."
"The most successful couples are those with a low negativity threshold. This means they don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other some room to complain. An arguing couple spiraling into negativity is equivalent to the beginning of a nuclear war. It also gives Peter a 1 in 285,000 chance of bumping into any one of these special ladies."
The World Economic Forum says that there's between a 10x and a 20x shortage of physicians in the developing world. Google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm. It would take about 300 years to train enough people to fix that problem.
"Deep learning is a form of machine learning that uses complex algorithms to predict what people will want to do. The better computers get at intellectual activities, the more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities. This is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before."
CNN's John Defterios looks at how computers are learning to do things we can't do ourselves. He says we need to think about how we will use computers in the future. Defterio: We need to make sure we don't rely on computers to solve our problems.
"Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works. It's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do. The more data you give it, the better it gets. The New York Times also showed another extraordinary result of deep learning."
"Deep learning is a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything. In 2011, we had the first example of computers that can see better than people. In 2012, Google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm watch YouTube videos and crunched the data on 16,000 computers for a month."
"Deep learning is helping computers understand what they see and can search databases of hundreds of millions of images in real time. Complex, nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms. Deep learning has been used to read Chinese, again at about native Chinese speaker level."
"Computer can now read and write sentences based on pictures. The technology is only two weeks old, but could be in use within a year. In tests, humans prefer the computer-generated caption one out of four times. In 1962, a computer beat the Connecticut state champion at checkers."
"In medicine, a team in Boston announced that they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer. In Stanford, a group announced that, looking at tissues under magnification, they've developed  a machine learning-based system which is better than human pathologists at predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers."
"The theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible. With our deep learning algorithm, it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images. It now takes us about 15 minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test."
The project took a team of five or six people about seven years to complete. It now takes just 15 minutes for one person acting alone to complete the task. The goal is to have 62 percent of the 1.5 million images classified correctly.
"Using this kind of process for each of the different groups, we are now up to an 80 percent success rate in classifying the 1.5 million images. At this point, it's just a case of finding the small number that aren't classified correctly, and trying to understand why."
How are we raising our children for now instead of yet? Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting As? Do we raise kids who don't know how to dream big dreams? Are they carrying this need for constant validation with them into their future lives?
"The words ""yet"" or ""not yet"" give kids greater confidence, give them a path into the future. Students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition. Those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades."
"In one year, a kindergarten class in Harlem, New York scored in the 95th percentile on the national achievement test. In a year, to a year and a half, Native American students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district to the top."
"Pimp My Carroça is a mobile art exhibition in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. Pimpx is inspired by TEDx and is a simplified, do-it-yourself, crowdfunded edition of Pimp MyCarroça."
"Pimp My Carroça is a group of street artists who collect waste and sell it to junk yards. They collect waste in carroças, which are built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil. In two years, over 170 catadores, 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 donors have been involved."
"Linguist: ""I want you to make as many new words as possible"" ""Don't! No. Creativity stops right here, Give it a rest"" ""I'm a lexicographer, not a grammar teacher,"" he says. ""I don't want to tell you what to do, I just want to help you"""
"Linguists call it borrowing, but we never give the words back, so I'm just going to be honest and call it stealing. Words in English are like Lego: If you use enough force, you can put any two of them together. Words like ""heartbroken,"" ""bookworm,""  ""sandcastle"" all are compounds."
"Every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other. Motel is a blend of ""motor"" and ""hotel"" Edutainment is a blending of ""education"" and 'entertainment"" Commercial used to be an adjective  and now it's a noun."
"Every word is a chance to express your idea and get  your meaning across. Mugwump is a perfectly  good word of English. Bulldozers bulldoze, butlers butle and burglers burgle. National Aeronautics and Space Administration becomes NASA."
"There are two kinds of grammar, one inside your brain, the other inside your language. English has no age limit. Start making words today, send them to me, and I will put them in my online dictionary, Wordnik. The word ""grammar"" was invented by a professor at Boston University in 1958."
"Whales release huge amounts of fecal matter into the ocean. This is important for the growth of phytoplankton, which is the base of all marine life. Whale carcasses are also known to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon per year."
"Many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced by 200 years of whaling. The Save the Whales movement was instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on. We need to address the more modern, pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today."
"Ilyse Hogue is the founder of Mejdi Tours, a social enterprise that aims to connect people. Hogue: Tourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls. ""I decided to dedicate my life to bringing down the walls that separate people,"" she says."
"One billion people who travel internationally every year travel like this, he says. ""This is the future of travel, and I invite you to join me to do that, to change your travel,"" he adds.

"Ilyse Hogue was inspired by Jane Jacobs, Stanley Milgram and Kevin Lynch. She used computer science tools to replicate social science experiments at scale, at web scale. Hogue: ""Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere"""
"Yahoo Labs has created a map of London weighted for human emotions. In tests, participants found the happy, the beautiful, the quiet path far more enjoyable than the shortest one. Walk the path through the park, not through the car park, and you have an entirely different path."
"CNN's John Sutter returns to the scene of the crime to find out what happened to the victims. Sutter: ""It's a tragedy that happened, but it's not a tragedy we want to forget"" Sutter found the victims on the side of the road in Cambridge, Massachusetts."
"Most of these crimes happened 32 years ago. We literally bring the  skeleton out of the ground. We'll take a small  fragment of the bone and we'll extract DNA from it. The other thing we want to understand is who they are. Whether it's a baby, or an adult."
"Grave 9 matched the family of Sergio Saul Linares. Grave 9 also matched the DNA of Amancio Villatoro. The DNA of that body also matched that family. The 300 means ""executed"" and the date means when they were executed."
"CNN's John Sutter reports from Guatemala. Sutter finds 533 bodies at a military base where peacekeepers are trained on top of bodies. The U.N. says about 40,000 people are still missing in the country. The Guatemalan government says it is still looking for the missing."
"Grave 15 was a grave full of women and children, 63 of them. Clothing from this grave matched the clothing from the region where these people were taken from. 83 percent of the victims are Mayan victims, victims that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of Central America."
"""We're giving a voice to the voiceless,"" he says. ""We have to now come together and decide that we're not going to have any more missing"" ""The most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to  defend us, the police, the military, are the ones that committed most of the crimes"""
"We used to have six billion hectares of forest -- 50 percent more than what we have now. In the last 100 years, we lost half of that. 12 percent of all the world's forests are in Brazil, most of that in the Amazon."
"Deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end of the '90s and the beginning of the 2000s. We still have 80 percent of the forest cover. But we lost 15 percent in just 30 years. So now in Brazil,  we have this system, DETER, where every month, we get information on where deforestation is happening."
"In the last 10 years, deforestation came down in Brazil 75 percent. Fifty million hectares of protected areas were created, which is an area the size of Spain. The indigenous people called this species pau brasil, and that's the reason why this land became ""land of Brasil"""
"Brazil has the largest deforestation rate in the world. 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation. The next step is to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in Brazil by 2020, he says. ""It's more or less like we are forest heroes, but still deforestation champions,"" he adds."
"""The forest is one of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change"" ""The goal is very clear. We want to limit the increase of the average temperature of the planet to two degrees"" ""We have a budget of emissions of 1,000 billion tons of CO2 from now until the end of the century"""
"In Brazil, almost 70 percent of the rain comes from the forest. The population is expected to grow from seven to nine billion by 2050. This means we need to reduce the amount of CO2 we emit by one ton per person per year. We can do this by reducing the number of people in the country by one."
"""We don't need to go back to the old way of doing things,"" says the mayor. ""We need a new way of looking at the world,"" he says. ""It's time to change the way the world looks at us,"" he adds."
"In India, we call it Jugaad. It is a Hindi word that means an improvised fix, a clever solution born in adversity. Frugal innovation is not about making do; it's about making things better. I think we are doing this with deforestation in Brazil, and I hope we can do it also with climate change in the world."
"Frugal innovation is being adopted on a larger scale to deliver healthcare and energy to billions of people who may have little income but very high aspirations. In China, the country's largest I.T. service provider, Neusoft, has developed a telemedicine solution to help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients in Chinese villages. In Kenya, a potter has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity."
The conventional business model in the West is more for more. The only way we can sustain growth and prosperity is if we learn to do more with less. Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers.
"Frugal innovation is also about making high tech more affordable and more accessible to more people. In China, the R&amp;D engineers of Siemens Healthcare have designed a C.T. scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers. In Peru, resourceful entrepreneurs can recharge your cell phone using bicycles."
"An engineering college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water. Be-Bound enables you to connect to the Internet even in no-bandwidth areas where there's no wi-fi or 3G or 4G. In France, there is a startup that allows thousands of people to walk into a Mom and Pop store and activate the service."
"Engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya are piloting a solution called Megaffic. The solution doesn't rely on roadside sensors, which are very expensive to install in Nairobi. Instead they process images, traffic data, collected from a small number of low-resolution webcams."
"The South pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity. The North is now learning to do more and better with less as it faces resource constraints. As an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States, my hope is that we transcend this artificial North-South divide."
"Groucho Marx: ""Why should I care about future generations? What have they ever done for me?"" Steve Forbes: ""I find it absurd to change my behavior today for something that will happen  in a hundred years"" ""There's only one concept that can reconcile those three time scales. It is simply having more consideration for others"""

"In evolution, cooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity. The OECD did a survey among 10 factors, including income, everything. The first one that people said, that's the main thing for my happiness, is quality of social relationships."
"""Banality of goodness is something that doesn't attract your attention, but it exists,"" he says. ""Our own mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy,"" he adds. ""It's neither selfish nor altruistic. It's either automatic behavior or it's not"""
"The Swiss village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon saved 3,500 Jews during the Second World War. The brain networks for empathy and loving-kindness are different, according to a new study. If we want a more altruistic society, we need individual change and societal change."
"CNN's John Defterios spent four weeks in an MRI machine to test the effect of meditation on the brain. He found that the brain changes significantly when it is in a state of meditation. Defterio: ""It's a very powerful thing to be able to change the way the brain works"""
"Culture is changing faster than the human race, says the head of the World Health Organisation. ""We need to change the way we think about the world,"" he says. ""The world is changing and we need to adapt to it,"" he adds."
"We are now the major agent of impact on our Earth. We need sustainable harmony. Sustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality. Homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty. We enter the Anthropocene, the era of human beings."
"""These Birds Walk"" is about wayward street kids who are struggling to find some semblance of family. The agenda behind our cinematic immersion was only empathy, an emotion that's largely deficient from films that come from our region of the world. The more I learned about these unethical practices, the more violated I felt."
"The Honest Chops meat shop is in the heart of New York's East Village fashion district. 90 percent of its in-store customers are not even Muslim, the owner says. For many, it is their first time interacting with Islam on such an intimate level, he says."
"""30 Mosques in 30 Days"" shared stories from over 100 vastly different Muslim communities. The stories ranged from Cambodian refugees in the L.A. projects to the black Sufis living in the woods of South Carolina. The media coverage forced local journalists to revisit their Muslim communities, but what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world being inspired to take their own 30-mosque journey."
"The robot is about the size of a Tic Tac. It can run about 10 body lengths per second, so 10 centimeters per second. The robot can also make 3D-printed versions that can climb over obstacles, a lot like the cockroach you saw earlier."
The robot is only four by four by seven millimeters in size. It jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it. Imagine the rubble that you get after a natural disaster like an earthquake. Or imagine what you could do if you had robots that could swim through your blood.
"UC Berkeley researcher explains how to make a semi-intelligent ant robot. He talks about how to combine rigid and soft materials in very, very small mechanisms. Insects store energy in a spring and release that quickly to get the high power they need to jump out of water."
"""I am a lesbian. I didn't want to be defined by them,"" says Morgan. Of all the employees surveyed, 61 percent said they changed their appearance to fit in. ""I wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles. I wasn't scared to be myself"""
The effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination. The U.S. House of Representatives is considering a bill that would allow gays and lesbians to opt out of public services. The bill would also allow them to sue if they feel they are discriminated against.
"Human resources worker says she has done nothing to advocate for diversity in the workplace. ""I made a choice today to reveal a part of myself that I have hidden for too long,"" she says. ""By facing my fears inside, I will be able to change reality outside,"" she adds."

"Miguel Nicolelis: ""What Juliano accomplished took 30 years to imagine in laboratories and about 15 years to plan"" ""A brain-machine interface is not rocket science, it's just brain research,"" Nicolelis says. ""I wouldn't be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times,"" he adds."
"Sensors read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing to generate the motor commands that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord. By doing that, we converted these signals into digital commands that any mechanical, electronic, or even a virtual device can understand. The subject can imagine what he, she or it wants to make move, and the device obeys that brain command."
"The first brain-controlled exoskeleton to be built was named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever, Alberto Santos Dumont. It allows the patient to imagine the movements and send his commands to the controls, the motors, and get it done. Brazil wanted to showcase a completely different country, a country that values science and technology, and can give a gift to millions."
"Brain-actuating technology is here to help paralyzed people walk again. The technology fools the brain by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him, but it is he who is walking again. Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick of the 2014 Brazilian  World Soccer Cup just by thinking."
"CNN's John Defterios shows how scientists are using monkeys to test new technology. Defterio: ""We are paid to be children, to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there"" ""We have no idea. Where is this going? We're just scientists,"" he says."
No monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys. Eighty percent of all diseases in India and most developing countries are because of poor quality water. Open defecation is rampant. 70 percent of India defecates in the open.
"The MANTRA project aims to improve sanitation in India's rural areas. Villages that agree to the project build a toilet and a shower room. Water will be piped to all households through three taps: one in the toilet, one  in the shower,  one in  the kitchen, 24 hours a day."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to El Salvador to visit a village where people build toilets and water towers. The village uses a system of two leach pits to treat the waste. Defterio: From the toilet, the muck comes into the first leach pit, and when it is full, it is blocked."
"Gram Vikas was working in the area of renewable energy. 1,200 villages have completed it. Waterborne diseases have come down 82 percent. Women used to spend six to seven hours a day carrying water. The most vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers."
Violence in Congo is in large part driven by local bottom-up conflicts that international peace efforts have failed to help address. Violence is driven by illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources and sexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war.
"The Democratic Republic of Congo is home to the largest and most expensive U.N. peacekeeping mission in the world. It is also home to some of the world's worst human rights abuses. In 2006, the country held the first free elections in its history, but violence continued."
U.N. peacekeepers have a dominant culture of conflict. They see conflict as the result of national and international tensions. It has led to a failure to address the root causes of conflict in the region. It is also the reason for the failure of peacekeeping efforts in Africa.
"Violence in Congo is motivated not only by national and international causes, but also by longstanding bottom-up agendas. Many conflicts revolve around political, social and economic stakes that are distinctively local. This competition often results in localized fighting, for instance in one village or territory, and quite frequently, it escalates into generalized fighting."
"Local conflicts fuel violence in most war and post-war environments. If we want international peacebuilding to work, conflicts must be resolved from the bottom up. In the rare cases where there have been comprehensive, bottom-up peacebuilding initiatives, these attempts have been successful."
"International and Congolese actors should pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict. Local nongovernmental organizations, local authorities and civil society representatives should be the main actors in the bottom-up process. In the province of the Kivus, the Life and Peace Institute has set up inter-community forums to discuss the specifics of local conflicts."

Three children per day in Australia are at risk of having FGM performed on them. FGM is violence against women. It says we don't have a right to our bodies. It's about visualizing the experience that people have. It goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation.
"Most drawings have nodes and links. nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people, and links represent the connections between the nodes. The average illustration has between four and eight nodes. So if you want to communicate something visually, have between five and 13 nodes in your diagram. The sweet spot is between 5 and 13."
"Sticky note systems are more fluid than static drawings. Participants don't feel map shock because they participate in the building of their models. With each iteration, the model becomes clearer because people build on top of each other's ideas. To deal with contradictions, for example, they add branching patterns."
"There's a visual revolution that's taking place as more organizations are addressing their wicked problems by collaboratively drawing them out. Movable cards produce better systems models, because we iterate much more fluidly. The group notes produce the most comprehensive models because we synthesize several points of view."
"Designers draw a loaf of bread, which is sliced, then put into a toaster. The toast is then deposited for some time and pops up after two minutes, toast and happiness.

I study monarchs because they get sick. They get sick like you. And I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans. The parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha.
"Scientists have found that monarchs can take up the chemicals and put it in their own bodies. This makes them toxic against their predators, such as birds. Scientists have also found that some milkweeds are medicinal, meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies."
"Every year, thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu. Can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick? Scientists have done these experiments now over several years, and always get the same results. In indigenous cultures, traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs."
"The discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely new avenues. I think that maybe one day, we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies, and that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing. The problem with infectious diseases, as we all know, is that pathogens continue to evolve."

"""I want to live in a world where people are happier and more fulfilled,"" says the author. The author's grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer's when he was just four years old. His family struggled to find a way to keep him from wandering off."
Psychological injuries are more common than physical ones. They can also get worse if we ignore them. There are scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries. But we don't. It doesn't even occur to us that we should.
"The hardest thing I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We missed each other terribly, but international phone calls were really expensive then, and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week. It's time we made them more equal, more like twins."
"Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do. Loneliness is defined purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you."
"Loneliness increases your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning of your immune system. Scientists have concluded that taken together, loneliness poses as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking."
"Psychologist David Perry: We all have a default set of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Perry: If your mind tries to convince you you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then you'll stop trying too soon, or you won't even try at all. He says that's why so many people function below their actual potential."
"""Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were"" ""Our mind is hard to change once we become convinced"" ""You cannot allow yourself to become convinced you can't succeed"" ""We have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins"""
"Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. The friend said: ""Well, what do you expect? You have big hips, you have nothing interesting to say"" We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were."
"When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. The urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. By spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are putting yourself at significant risk for developing clinical depression."
The author's brother was diagnosed with cancer and had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy. She says she couldn't stop thinking about what he was going through. Studies tell us that even a two-minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment.
"In the mid-'90s, the CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the U.S. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about."
"In high doses, it affects brain development, the immune system, hormonal systems and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. Sixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ACE, and 12.6 percent, one in eight, had four or more ACEs."
"High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function, they affect the developing immune system, developing hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. The reason for this has to do with the brain's and body's stress response system that governs our fight-or-flight response."
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to reduce the number of children suffering from ACEs. The agency is also working to improve the quality of life for those who suffer from the condition, such as children and adults with disabilities."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the impact of mental illness on children. Sutter: ""I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us"" ""The single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face"""
"I Read I Write is a series of photos by Arab photographer Nour El-Ghaffar. El- Ghaffar follows women in the Arab world as they learn to read and write. One of her subjects was Umm El-Saad from Egypt, who was barely able to write her name."
"Photographer Yannick Lina Khatib has been documenting the lives of women in the Arab world. She has photographed women in Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Lebanon. She says she was inspired by her own experiences to make a difference in her own life."
"Brazilian author and mother-of-two, Luiz Inácio Pinto explains how to achieve your dreams. Pinto: Decide to settle when growth is guaranteed. Decides to work harder than ever to find yourself another peak."
"The author has traveled to every state in Brazil to promote his new book. ""If you have dreams, it's your responsibility to make them happen,"" he says. ""There's no time to settle down. There is no time for settling down,"" he adds."
"Life is never about the goals, it's about the journey. The only way to achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey. Some steps will be right on. Sometimes you will trip. But achieving a dream is a momentary sensation, and your life is not."
"If every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate, you will for sure enjoy the journey. Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your life through that moment. If it's right on, celebrate, because some people wait a lot to celebrate."
" microbes have implications for all these different kinds of diseases, ranging from inflammatory  bowel disease to obesity, and perhaps even autism and depression. What microbes you have in your gut determine whether particular painkillers are toxic to your liver. They also determine whether or not other drugs will work for your heart condition."
" NIH funded a $173 million project to map out all the A's, T's, G's, and C's in the human body. The map shows the oral, vaginal, skin, and fecal communities. Different parts of the map in different colors, almost like separate continents."
"Each of us consists of about 10 trillion human cells, but we harbor as many as 100 trillion microbial cells. Each of us has about 20,000 human genes, but up to 20 million microbial genes. So whichever way we look at it, we're vastly outnumbered by our microbial symbionts."
"In adults, microbial communities are relatively stable, so even if you live together with someone, you'll maintain your separate microbial identity over a period of weeks, months, even years. It turns out that our first microbial communities depend a lot on how we're born."
"The Human Microbiome Project looks at the gut microbes of children and adults. In one video, a child gets antibiotics for an ear infection. Within weeks, the child has reached the healthy adult stool community. This raises questions about what happens when we intervene at different ages in child's life."
"Microbes have been linked to a whole range of different diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, heart disease, colon cancer, and even obesity. When we take the microbes from an obese mouse and transplant them into a genetically normal mouse, it becomes fatter than if it got them from a regular mouse."
"Gates Foundation is funding a project to use microbes to treat malnutrition in Malawi. The project is the largest crowd-funded science project of its kind in the world. Over 8,000 people have signed up to take part in the project."
"Scientists have been trying to find a way to stop illegal logging in the rainforest by using what's already in the forest. They hope to use stool from a healthy donor, that star down at the bottom, to transplant into patients with C. diff. Four of those patients are about to get a transplant from that healthy donor. Immediately, you have this radical change in the gut community."
"Deforestation accounts for more greenhouse gas than all of the world's planes, trains, cars, trucks and ships combined. 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal, according to Interpol. The moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest, the device picks up the sound and sends an alert through the standard GSM network."
"The device can listen to the sounds of the forest. It is able to hear chainsaw noises up to a kilometer in the distance. But if someone were to take them, it would make the area unprotected. The device is powered by a solar panel built from recycled industrial byproducts."
"In Indonesia, the device picked up illegal chainsaw noises. It was able to get a real-time alert. The device also detected a cicada, a rhinoceros hornbill, and other birds. The tool is now being trialled in other parts of the world."
The project is based on the use of old cell phones in a gibbon reserve. People from around the world have been sending in their own old phones to be used in the project. The idea is to turn down the sound of the gibbons so they can't be heard by humans.
"Twenty-five years ago, scientists at CERN created the World Wide Web. Since then, the Internet has transformed the way we communicate, do business, and even live. Today, when we send an email, we're not sending a letter. What you are sending, in many ways, is actually a postcard."
"The business model of the Internet today really isn't compatible with privacy. To optimize the ads that are shown to us, companies have to know everything about us. If we want to have privacy online, what we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves."
"Scientists at the CERN nuclear research center in Switzerland have created a new way to send private emails. Called ProtonMail, the service encrypts emails before they leave the server. The project was inspired by the Edward Snowden leaks, which led to the creation of Protonmail."
"ProtonMail lets users send encrypted messages without the server seeing them. The idea is to protect privacy without the need for ad revenue. ProtonMail is a free, open-source email service based in San Francisco. The company has raised more than half a million dollars in donations."
"We need to build an Internet where privacy is not just an option, but the default. We need to protect our personal data, which tells us who we are and what we want to do. This is not an American or a European issue, it's a global issue."
"As the web turns 25, it's very important for us to take a moment and think about the implications of this. We've lost privacy, yes, but what we've also lost is the idea of privacy itself. The more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever, so your data can and will outlive you."
"Sturgeon's law is that the majority of anything is always bad. But he doesn't have to be correct forever. ""Things can always change,"" he says. ""This is the best secret I've ever experienced. It starts with a deck of cards"""
"An audience member asks, ""What is the king of spades?"" A man says, ""It could be a club or a spade,"" and his answer is ""a high spade"" The audience member says ""the king"" is the card with the highest number."
"HG: ""I knew exactly what that meant. I knew that he was going to touch the deck"" HG: ""Everything that you're about to see is exactly as it looked to me"" ""The old man stood up, he left. The old man only said one more thing,"" HG says."
"I believe that amazing things happen all the time, I really do. And the reason why we don't see them as often, it's because we. don't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things. So you have the giraffe, go ahead, throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random. I'm going to ask you, do you have, with you, a United States $1 bill?"
"Helder Guimarães: I have a dollar bill here to explain. I want you to take the bill and fold it like this, lengthwise, so it becomes like a rectangle. When you have it, please fold the bill again into a little square like this."
"Portuguese author asks audience to help him shuffle a deck of cards. ""I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it. But the important part is after shuffling the cards, always remember to cut and complete the cards,"" he says."
"HG: I have a deck of cards cut and shuffled by one, two, three, four and five people. I'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone. The secret of this dollar bill is the serial number."
HG: Seven. The first number after the letter is seven. The second number is nine. The third number is three. The fourth number is four. The fifth number is two. The final number is five. The last number is six.

"Harry is the author of ""59,"" a love poem about prime numbers. The poem was written for a prime number-themed poetry competition. Harry is a U.K. poetry champion and was invited to the Poetry World Cup in Paris."
"According to five French strangers, France is full of 'Paper People' The idea of 'pop-up purple paper people' has been suggested. The idea is to create a pop-up metropolis of 'paper people' with pay-per-view TV."
"The author is the author of a new book, A Man Walks On To The Moon. The book is based on a novel written by the same name, about a man who walks on the moon. The author says the book is about the man who walked on to the moon, and the people who followed."
"The author's poetry has been the ultimate way of ideas without frontiers. He writes about people who go out of their way to make your life better, and expect nothing in return. ""People have potential to be powerful. We don't need to succumb to that system,"" he says."

"L'Ospedale degli Innocenti, built in 1419 by Brunelleschi, was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time. It has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air, and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings."
"The first crematorium in the U.K. was built in Woking in the 1870s. When this was first built, there were protests in the local village. Cremation wasn't socially acceptable, and 99.8 percent of people got buried. But now, three quarters of us get cremated."
"After the Second World War, a lot of countries set up universal healthcare systems. The result was that lifespans extended from about 45 at the start of the century to almost double that today.

"We need more than just donations of money to Africa. We need jobs. Let's build a better world. The more we let our culture of click-bait become the norm, the more we allow it to become a way of life for many. We are all victims."
"Shame is a symptom of the culture we've created. Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop. Online, we've got a compassion deficit, an empathy crisis. We need to return to a long-held value of compassion, compassion and empathy."
"The theory of minority influence, proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici, says that even in small numbers, when there's consistency over time, change can happen. In the online world, we can foster minority influence by becoming upstanders. Even empathy from one person can make a difference."
"CNN's John Sutter says it's time for him to take back his narrative. Sutter: ""Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing: You can survive it"" ""We all deserve compassion and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world,"" he says."
"In 1998, the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major news story. I was branded as a tramp, tart, slut, whore, bimbo, and, of course, ""that woman"" I was seen by many, but actually known by few."
"In 1998, the oldest among the group were only 14, and the youngest, just four. In 1998, I lost my reputation and my dignity. And I almost lost my life. Today, I want to share some of my experience with you. I hope my past experience can lead to a change."

"CNN's John Sutter writes about the impact of social media on children. Sutter: ""It's not just kids who are affected by social media. It's adults who can't cope with it"" Sutter says social media has made it easier for people to be cruel to others."
"There is a very personal price to public humiliation, and the internet has jacked up that price. Gossip websites, paparazzi, reality programming, politics, news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame. It's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online, which lends itself to trolling and cyberbullying."
"The more we click on this kind of gossip, the more numb we get to the human lives behind it. A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity, and shame is an industry. We're in a dangerous cycle. We have made fabulous megapixel cameras, but we have not delivered sight to the blind. When machines can see, doctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes."
"Leo Tolstoy: We need to give computers visual intelligence and to create a better future for Leo and for the world. For the first time, human eyes won't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world. We will not only use the machines for their intelligence, we will also collaborate with them."
"The goal of computer vision is to teach computers to see like people do. Fei-Fei Li: ""We want them to be able to identify people, places and things"" The first step is to train the computer to see objects in a specific way."
"A new study shows that a child's first experience of the world is through images. The study used the largest ever collection of images from the Internet. The project was led by Princeton University and involved more than 50,000 people. It is the first time the data has been used in this way."
"In 2009, the ImageNet project delivered a database of 15 million images across 22,000 classes of objects and things organized by everyday English words. In both quantity and quality, this was an unprecedented scale. The wealth of information provided by ImageNet was a perfect match to a class of machine learning algorithms."
"Computer vision is one of the most frontier and potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science. A typical neural network has 24 million nodes, 140 million parameters, and 15 billion connections. We applied this algorithm to millions of Google Street View images across hundreds of American cities."
"The computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by humans. The model connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences. The computer still makes mistakes, and it still has a lot to learn."
"Computer has been taught to see objects or even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture. The real challenge is to go from three to 13 and far beyond, says the father of one of the images. ""I think of Leo constantly and the future world he will live in,"" he says."

The StoryCorps app is a digital facilitator that walks you through the interview process. With one tap upload it to our archive at the Library of Congress. The real challenge is up to you: to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across America.
"CNN.com is creating a digital archive of conversations that are enduring and important. Interview a family member, a friend or even a stranger. Together, we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity, and maybe in doing so, we'll learn to listen a little more and shout less."
"""I exist"" became the clarion call for StoryCorps, this crazy idea that I had a dozen years ago. The thought was to take documentary work and turn it on its head. So in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago, we built a booth where anyone can come to honor someone else by interviewing them."

"CNN's John Defterios looks at why the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was so slow to spread. He says there are three reasons why it took so long to get out of the country. The first, he says, is that the outbreak was in a remote area. The second is that it was in an area where it was unlikely to spread quickly."
"The source of the virus could be  a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism. In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air, like the Spanish Flu back in 1918. We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here."
"Health systems in poor countries need to be strengthened. We need to do simulations, germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are. The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well."
"The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic, global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars. The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D, those things would reduce  global health equity and make the world more just  as well as more safe."
"CNN's John Defterios meets with Aboriginal people in Australia to discuss the U.S.-China relationship.

"In 1971, at 14 years of age, Kè Wén decided to learn Chinese. His Chinese teacher gave him a new name: Kè, which means to overcome or to conquer, and Wén, and that's the character for literature or the arts. Kè now lives in China with his family."
"""I've been called Kevin all my life. Would you prefer to be called Conqueror of the Classics?"" he asks. ""It's a major lift from being called Kevin,"" he says. ""I'm not sure I like it,"" he adds."
"History is against us when it comes to the U.S. and China forging a common future together. Sun Tzu wrote ""The Art of War,"" and if you see his statement underneath, it's along these lines: ""Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected"""
"China feels as if it's been humiliated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history. China also believes that it is being contained by U.S. allies. And beyond all that, the Chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those in the collective West are just too damned arrogant."
"The U.S. and the West say China cheats on the question of intellectual property rights, and through cyberattacks on global firms. The United States says that the Chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it's at such fundamental variance to the human rights, democracy, and rule of law that we enjoy in the collective West. The challenge is how to craft a basis for a common future between these two."

"The artist used Google Street View and Google Maps imagery to create a virtual reality of his home. He also created a triptych called ""The Treachery of Sanctuary"" ""I'm essentially taking  a piece of your history and putting it inside  the framing of the story,"" he says."
"Virtual reality is difficult to explain because it's a very experiential medium. It's a machine, but inside of it, it feels like real life. We take this and we build, basically, a sphere of a world that you inhabit."
"""Clouds Over Sidra"" tells the story of a 12-year-old girl living in a refugee camp in Jordan. The film was made in conjunction with the United Nations and a virtual reality company. ""I think I was a stronger baby than my brother,"" the girl says."

"Americans think that the bottom 20 percent has about 2.9 percent of the wealth, the next group has 6.4, so together it's slightly more than nine. The next group, they say, has 12 percent, 20 percent, and the richest 20 percent people think has 58 percent. Reality is slightly different."
"CNN's John Sutter asks a group of Americans what a just society would look like. He says it's like a blind tasting, in which you don't know what the outcome will be. Sutter: ""We have this knowledge gap between what we have and what we think we have"""
"CNN asked people in different parts of the world for their views on wealth. People in the U.S., England and Australia all gave the same answer. ""It's hard to see, there's yellow and blue in there,"" says CNN's John Sutter."
People are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency. We have two gaps: We have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap. How do we get people to think differently about inequality and the consequences of inequality?
"phthalmologist: ""How do we take these things and actually do something about it?

"Young boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents, and they are put to work as sex slaves. Around 1,600 Hazara members had been killed in various attacks, and around 3,000 of them were injured, many of them permanently disabled."
"When it came time to leave Pakistan, Australia seemed the obvious choice. The attacks on the Hazara community would only get worse, so it was not surprising that many wanted to flee. It was a desperate decision to take, to leave everything behind, and no one makes this decision easily."
"The journey began in the night on an old fishing boat that was already overloaded. The first night and day went smoothly, but by the second night, the weather turned. The waves were much higher than our boat, and the water poured in faster than the motor pumps could take it out."
"We spent the night in a tree next to a wall topped with shards of glass. At 4 a.m. an officer came and furtively strip-searched us. He told us that we are not going to make it, we have to turn back. He built minarets with their heads."
"After the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers, I got a chance to go to Afghanistan for the first time, with foreign journalists. My parents also fled to Pakistan, and settled in Quetta, where I was born. It is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate, in limbo. The issue of asylum seekers in Australia has been so extremely politicized that it has lost its human face."

KS: Most of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger. I am urging you to become angry. The angriest among us is the one who can transform his anger into idea and action. I had been a big admirer  of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.
"Mahatma Gandhi's birth centenary was celebrated in India in 1969. Gandhi taught us how to treat the most vulnerable sections of society with dignity and respect, he says. Gandhi invited low-caste people to eat food cooked and served by the untouchable community. Gandhi: ""We can bring about change in the society"""
"All these untouchables, three women and two men, they agreed to come. I could recall that they had used the best of their clothes. They brought new utensils. They had taken baths  hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do."
"Kailash's mother told him: ""You have done your bit. You have eaten the food cooked by untouchables"" Kailash: ""I was emotionally drained, rather exhausted. Then I sat down where the food was lying. I kept my emotions on hold"""
"Before becoming a children's rights activist, Ravi Agrawal worked as an engineer. He says he learned how the energy of burning fire, coal, the nuclear blast inside the chambers, raging river currents, fierce winds, could be converted into the light and lives of millions. ""I cannot explain my joy when I free a child,"" he says."
"At the age of 11, when I realized how important education is for every child, I got an idea to collect used books and help the poorest children. Later on, I cofounded the world's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the Global Campaign for Education. In Europe and America,  we have been successful. And it has resulted  in a fall in child labor in South Asian countries."
"Kailash Satyarthi: Anger is a power, anger is an energy, and the law of nature is that energy can never be created and never  be vanished, cannever be destroyed. Satyarti: So why can't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world, a more just and equitable world? "" Anger is within each one of you,"" he says."
"Corporate profit margins are at a 40-year high of 12.5 percent. The further to the right you go, the greater the income inequality. The more you go up that, the worse the problems are. The U.S. has the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems."
Tudor: The profits mania that we're on is so deeply entrenched that we don't even realize how we're harming society. Tudor: We're not going to change corporate behavior by simply increasing corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions. But we can do it by driving more just behavior.
"Just Capital is an independent not-for-profit with no bias. Its mission is to help companies learn how to operate in a more just fashion. The group will conduct a nationwide survey of 20,000 Americans to find the criteria for justness in corporate behavior."
"Laughter is an ancient behavior which helps us regulate how we feel and make us feel better. ""When we put justness on par with profits, we'll get the most wonderful thing in all the world"" ""We have put so much emphasis on profits, on short-term quarterly earnings"""
"Laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises. To understand laughter, you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientists don't normally spend much time looking at. You use the intercostal muscles, the muscles between your ribs, to bring air in and out of your lungs."
"Laughter is associated with play, and all mammals play. You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else. Most laughter is in social interactions like conversation. When we laugh with people, we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes."
"Laughter is an enormously behaviorally contagious effect. You can catch laughter from somebody else, and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them. You are laughing to show people that you understand them, that you agree with them and that you're part of the same group as them."
"Laughter is different from social laughter. People are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter. When you start laughing hard, you start squeezing air out from your lungs under much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily. Chimpanzees laugh differently if they're being tickled."
"Laughter is an important social cue, according to the researchers. When you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter, the brains are responding completely differently, significantly differently. Laughter seems to be associated with greater auditory processing of these novel sounds. It's very unambiguous."
"Laughter is always meaningful, says neuroscientist and Royal Society member. Laughter is different for different age groups, according to a new study. The younger you are, the more you want to join in when you hear laughter, the study found."
"Laughter is a phenomenally useful index of how people are regulating their emotions together. Laughter is not just emitting it at each other to show that we like each other, we're making ourselves feel better together. As you get older, it all becomes  less contagious to you."
"Heinrich's friends are already laughing, hard. It's much more like an animal call than it is like speech. The fact that the laughter works, it gets him from a painful, embarrassing, difficult situation, into a funny situation. I think that's a really interesting use, and it's actually happening all the time."

"The term GMO is scientifically meaningless, says plant geneticist. Breeders have also used other types of genetic techniques, such as random mutagenesis. This induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations, and this is even a higher risk than many of the modern methods."
"Each year, 40 percent of the potential harvest is lost to pest and disease. Farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance. This approach has been used for nearly 100 years. It wasn't until the 1990s that scientists uncovered the genetic basis of resistance."
"Rice could withstand two weeks of complete submergence. Flooding is expected to be increasingly problematic as the climate changes. Breeders developed a rice variety carrying the Sub1 gene using another genetic technique. The rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered, called Sub1, was alive."
"With the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, three and a half million farmers grew Sub1 rice last year. Genetic modification can be the cheapest, safest, and most effective technology for enhancing food security and advancing sustainable agriculture. In the 1950s, a virus nearly wiped out the entire production of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii."
"Eighty percent of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered. The genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus. Bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides two to three times a week, sometimes twice a day, when pest pressure is high."
"Scientists in Bangladesh have used genetic engineering to fight pests and disease. The technique is less toxic to humans, fish and birds than traditional insecticides. In less developed countries, 500,000 children go blind every year because of lack of Vitamin A. Scientists genetically engineered a golden rice to produce beta-carotene."
Researchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day will save the lives of thousands of children. Golden rice is virulently opposed by activists who are against genetic modification. Every major scientific organization in the world has concluded that the crops currently on the market are safe to eat.
"Pamela Ronald: What scares me most about the loud arguments and misinformation about plant genetics is that the poorest people who most need the technology may be denied access. The fear is that those incentives mean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds, and even if it was, there would be unintended consequences."
The flood-tolerant rice is distributed freely through Indian and Bangladeshi seed certification agencies. There are no commercial profits in this situation. The golden rice was developed through support of the Rockefeller Foundation. The rice is being freely distributed.
"""The Red Circle and the Blue Curtain"" is about the future of machine intelligence. ""I like to think back further  to the ultimate cause. Look at these two highly distinguished gentlemen: We have Kanzi -- he's mastered 200 lexical tokens. And Ed Witten unleashed the second superstring revolution"""
"Human mind has evolved over 250,000 generations. Machine superintelligence is on the verge of a profound change in the substrate of thinking, says Andrew Keen. Keen: A.I. is nowhere near having the powerful, cross-domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has."
"The ultimate limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside the limits in biological tissue. A biological neuron fires at 200 hertz, 200 times a second. But even a present-day transistor operates at the Gigahertz. The potential for superintelligence lies dormant in matter."
"The future of artificial intelligence is likely to be very different from what we think, says Ed Witten. Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make, he says. Machines will then be better at inventing than we are, and they'll be doing so on digital timescales."
A superintelligence is a really strong optimization process. It's extremely good at using available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized. This means that there is no necessary connection between being highly intelligent in this sense and having an objective that we humans would find worthwhile or meaningful.
"Human beings in this model are threats, we could prevent the mathematical problem from being solved. If you create a powerful optimization process to maximize for objective x, you better make sure  that your definition of x incorporates everything you care about. This is a lesson that's also taught in many a myth. King Midas wishes that everything he touches be turned into gold."
"CNN's John Sutter: How confident can we be that the A.I. couldn't find a bug? He says we should not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligent genie locked up in its bottle forever. Sutter says the answer is to create superint intelligent A.i. such that even if it escapes, it is still safe because it shares our values."
"Sam Kelly: Making superintelligent A.I. is a really hard challenge. He says we should work out a solution to the control problem in advance, so that we have it available by the time it is needed. Kelly: If  things turn out okay, that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right."
"The brain is an amazing and complex organ. The brain is sending electrical messages back and forth, and chemical messages. Have you ever heard what your brain sounds like? GG: Let's try it out. So I'm going to turn this on for a second."

"One out of five of us, that's 20 percent of the entire world, will have a neurological disorder. And there are zero cures for these diseases. ""What we should be doing is reaching back earlier in the eduction process and teaching students about neuroscience,"" he says."
Bacteria can be programmed to detect and treat diseases like cancer. Bacteria can grow in areas where the immune system has no access. Scientists have programmed bacteria to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer. The technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer.
"Scientists have developed a way to create DNA programs that can be programmed into bacteria. The program allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize, as you're seeing in this movie. The technology is really powerful because it takes these phenomena that we normally have to experience through touch and it lets us capture them visually and non-invasively."
Scientists have developed a way to turn visible objects into visual microphones from a distance. Traditional microphones work by converting the motion of an internal diaphragm into an electrical signal. But sound causes all objects to vibrate. Those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see.
"Abe Davis: A single frame of video may have hundreds of thousands of pixels in it. AD: If we combine all of the tiny motions that we see from across that entire image, then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel can start to add up to something pretty significant. He says even with the right algorithm, we were still missing a pretty important piece of the puzzle."
"AD: ""This was really significant, because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech from silent video of an object"" AD: ""We analyzed all of these experiments until we really understood the limits of our technique"" ""Once we understood those limits, we could figure out how to push them"""
"Scientists have developed a way to use vibrations in a video to capture objects in a way that will let us interact with them and see how they react to us. The technology could be used for surveillance, but it could also be used to learn more about the world."
A new technique allows scientists to simulate objects using just five seconds of video. The technique can be used to study objects in a variety of ways. The video below shows the first 21 days of a bee's life as it hatches into a larva.
"Researchers are working on finding alternatives to control mites. They succeeded in breeding mite-resistant bees, but in that process, those bees started to lose traits like gentleness and their ability to store honey. To overcome that problem, these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers."
"Bees pollinate one third of our food crops, and lately they've been having a hard time. The single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from Asia, Varroa destructor. This eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees."
"Bamboo has the tensile strength of steel, the compressive strength of concrete. It's lightweight, light enough to be lifted by just a few men, or, apparently, one woman. When my father built Green School in Bali, he chose bamboo for all of the buildings."
"Bamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world for literally tens of thousands of years. Until recently, it was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects. Most people, especially in Asia, think that you couldn't be poor enough or rural enough to actually want to live in a bamboo house."
"The house in Bali is built almost entirely from bamboo. It was designed by a team of local architects and designers. The bamboo is designed for curving, tapering, hollow poles. The living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor."
"The building is almost entirely handmade using hand-whittled bamboo pins. The bamboo floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin. The structural connections of our buildings are reinforced by steel joints, but we use a lot of hand- whittledamboo pins. There are thousands of pins in each floor."
"With creativity and commitment, you can create beauty and comfort and safety and even luxury out of a material that will grow back. We made an air-conditioned, tented bed in the corner of her living room. Boxing off an area with tall walls just didn't feel right, so instead we made this giant woven pod."
"Every affair will redefine a relationship, and every couple will determine what the legacy of the affair will be. The victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage. Betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms. Sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner."
"""I look at affairs from a dual perspective: hurt and betrayal on one side, growth and self-discovery on the other,"" he says. ""Most of us are going to have two or three relationships or marriages,"" he adds. ""Who knows what's really going on under the sheets there, right?"""
"The definition of infidelity keeps on expanding: sexting, watching porn, staying secretly active on dating apps. There is no universally agreed-upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity. 95 percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie about having an affair, but just about the same amount of us would do that if we were having one."
"It's never been more difficult to keep a secret, and never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll. When marriage was an economic enterprise, infidelity threatened our economic security. But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement, inf fidelity threatens our emotional security. Infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love."
"""I thought I knew who I was. Now, I question everything"" ""We are entitled to pursue our desires,"" says author. ""We have never been more inclined to stray"" ""It's the way of the world now,"" says writer."
"If divorce carried all the shame, today, choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame. The vast majority of people that I actually work with are not at all chronic philanderers. They are often people who are deeply monogamous in their beliefs, and at least for their partner."
"At the heart of an affair, you will often find a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection. Affairs are an act of betrayal, and they are also an expression of longing and loss. Some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness, in an antidote to death."
"An affair is less about sex, and more about desire: desire for attention, desire to feel special. The very structure of an affair, the fact that you can never have your lover, keeps you wanting. Some affairs are death knells for relationships that were already dying on the vine. But others will jolt us into new possibilities."
"Couples will have depths of conversations with honesty and openness that they haven't had in decades. Infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy. We know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator acknowledges their wrongdoing. When they are done well, they are remixable, adaptable and they are powerful."
"Roman Mars: People are passionate about flags, you know? That's the way it is. I put this picture online, and sure enough, someone left a comment that said, ""You can take that Scottish Saltire and shove it up your ass."" That hurts me just to look at it."
"Ted Kaye is a flag expert and editor of a scholarly journal on flag studies. Kaye's first city flag was a beaut: white field, two horizontal blue stripes, and four six-pointed red stars down the middle. The blue stripes represent the water, the river and the lake."
"The Chicago flag has become a symbol of the city's pride. The flag is made up of five colors: red, white, blue, green and black. It was designed to represent the city, not just the city itself. The Chicago flag was created by a group of artists in the 1960s."
"The flag represents the city rising from the ashes after the devastating fires of the 1850s. The main component of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix. Behind the phoenix, the background is mostly white, and then it has a substantial gold border around it."
"Most country flags are OK, but not US city flags, says CNN's John Sutter. ""We just can't stop ourselves from putting our names on our flags,"" Sutter says. ""If you can't tell what city they go to, yeah, that's exactly the problem, except for Anaheim"""
"The European equivalent of the municipal seal is the city coat of arms. These flags are everywhere in the US. The flag of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was adopted in 1955. The seal-on-a-bedsheet flags are particularly painful and offensive to me."
"Steve Kodis, a graphic designer from Milwaukee, wants to change the city's flag. The flag includes a picture of the Civil War battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment. 105 entries were received, but none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city."
"Steve Kotas is trying to redesign the Milwaukee flag. He says the best way to make a good flag is to take the motto off. Kotas: ""In every bad flag there's a good Flag trying to get out"" ""Every great city deserves a great flag,"" he says."
The San Francisco city flag is in need of a makeover. The city flag could become a symbol of how a city considers design. The current design is too big and doesn't represent the city well. Here are some suggestions to make the flag more beautiful.
A well-designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city considers all of its design systems. The marriage of good design and civic pride is something that we need in all places. The best part about municipal flags is that we own them.

"In 1772, Lord Mansfield ruled that James Somerset was a legal person. He issued the writ of habeus corpus, and James's body was brought in by the captain of the ship. The Nonhuman Rights Project is looking at what values and principles judges should use."
"The Nonhuman Rights Project argues that drawing a line in order to enslave an autonomous and self-determining being like you're seeing behind me, that that's a violation of equality. It took us seven years, to find the jurisdiction where we wanted to begin filing our first suit. We chose the state of New York."
Chimpanzees are numerate and have a social culture. They have some kind of moral capacity. They don't have any legal rights. Scientists in the Taï Forests in the Ivory Coast found chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open the incredibly hard nuts.
"The Nonhuman Rights Project filed three suits all across the state of New York using the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument that had been used with James Somerset. They wanted the chimpanzees out, and we wanted them brought to Save the Chimps, a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in South Florida."

"In 2011, during the final six months of Kim Jong-Il's life, I lived undercover in North Korea. It was a special year, marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's original Great Leader, Kim Il-Sung. To celebrate the occasion, the regime shut down all universities, and sent students off to the fields."
"The students were not allowed to leave the campus, or communicate with their parents. Their days were meticulously mapped out, and any free time they had was devoted to honoring their Great Leader. Lesson plans had to meet the approval of North Korean staff. Every room was bugged, and every conversation, overheard."
"The North Korean leader's ideology and his students' day-to-day realities were all built on lies. The difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them. They lie to shield their system from the world, or they were taught lies, and were just regurgitating them."

"MIRA, a P.C. software platform, uses a motion capture camera to transform traditional exercises into video games. The software is very customizable, and physical therapists can also create their own exercises. Poor muscle tone and impaired balance are the number one cause of falls, so reversing these problems through targeted exercise will help keep older people safer."
"The tool is now available in over 10 countries, including the U.S. and the UK. It can be used to help patients with physical and mental health problems. It costs less than $1,000 and can be downloaded by anyone with an Xbox One."
"Physicists work with patients to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury. Patients find physical therapy boring, frustrating, confusing and lengthy before seeing results. The majority of patients don't do their exercises and therefore take a lot longer to get better."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the search for alien life. Sutter: There are just so many stars and so many planets out there, that surely, there must be life somewhere out there. ""We have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet,"" Sutter says."
"Kepler-186f is in a zone that is not too far from the star, so that the temperature may be just right for life. We know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars, and there's likely many more out there. If we could visit one of those planets, you would see two sunsets and have two shadows."
"This planet is over 50 times closer to its star than our Earth is to the sun. The surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid lava lakes. We don't know much about this planet, but one possibility is that it's a water world."
"Astronomers have been able to study dozens of exoplanet atmospheres, about six of them in great detail. But those are not small planets like Earth. They're big, hot planets that are easy to see. And in the search for planets, and in the future, planets that might be like Earth, we're able to help address some of the most amazing and mysterious questions."
"MIT professor explains how exoplanet atmospheres are studied. Each different atom and molecule has a special set of lines, a fingerprint, if you will. The goal is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres that don't belong, that we might be able to attribute to life."
"Life produces thousands of gases, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, molecular hydrogen, molecular nitrogen, methane, methyl chloride. ""We think we have found something very interesting in another field,"" researcher says. ""How and why did life originate and populate our planet? But a really big challenge ahead of us is: how?"""
"The starshade is a specially shaped screen that blocks out the light of a star. The goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision so that we'd be able to see the planets directly. It's shaped like a giant flower, and this is one of the prototype petals."
"In the next generation of space telescopes, we will have the capability to find and identity other Earths. We are making a new kind of map of the nearby stars and of the planets orbiting them.

"The FBI is responsible for more terrorism plots in the U.S. than any other organization. An informant can earn 100,000 dollars or more for every terrorism case they bring to the FBI. The FBI is paying mostly criminals and con men six figures to spy on communities in the United States."
"Sami Osmakac, a young man who was living near Tampa, Florida, had no connections to international terrorist groups. An FBI informant gave him a job, handed him money, introduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist. The lead undercover agent would go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on."
"CNN's John Sutter says the U.S. government has a problem with ""hollywood terrorists"" Sutter: The FBI has never been able to prove that these people are actually terrorists. He says the problem is that the government doesn't know what to do about it."
The Intercept published a story about how Sami Osmakac was set up in an FBI sting. The story was based on leaked transcripts of private FBI conversations. The FBI spends 3.3 billion dollars a year on domestic counterterrorism activities. The pursuit of terrorists has consumed the FBI.
"In the 14 years since 9/11, you can count about six real terrorist attacks in the United States. The FBI has bragged about how it's foiled dozens of terrorism plots. In all, the FBI has arrested more than 175 people in aggressive, undercover stings."
"LZ Granderson: ""Babies' first words aren't just things like balls and ducks, they're things like ""all gone"" ""They're figuring out the entire world. It has to be that powerful,"" he says. ""There really is genius there that is underappreciated"""
" LS: In any scenario, our machines have so much to learn from our toddlers. Mark Twain summed up what I take to be one of the fundamental problems of cognitive science with a single witticism. It's the structured, hierarchical nature of human knowledge that remains a real challenge."
"Babies make generalizations about almost everything, says David Frum. Frum: ""One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment in fact"" ""It's really easy to pull three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly blue balls,"" he says."
"A baby's ability to generalize properties of blue balls to yellow balls is fascinating. From a few bones, we infer the existence of dinosuars. The really interesting question is what happens when we show babies exactly the same thing. That is not plausibly randomly sampled evidence."
"LZ Granderson: Babies are much more likely to generalize the evidence when it's plausibly representative of the population. LZ: ""Babies, in this respect, like scientists, care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not"" He says babies use this to develop expectations about the world: what squeaks and what doesn't."
"In this next experiment, we're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other. Some people can make this toy go, and some can't. The important point here is it provides a little bit of evidence that the problem isn't with the toy, it's with the person."
"LS: I have spent the past decade trying to understand the mystery of how children learn so much from so little so quickly. YG: Arthur, let me try again, okay? L: Of course babies give toys to their mommies when they can't make them work. L: And this suggests it doesn't matter who tries this toy, the toy is broken."
" LS: In the second year of life, babies can use a tiny bit of statistical data to decide between two fundamentally different strategies for acting in the world. LS: Children's ability to make rich inferences from sparse data underlies all the species-specific cultural learning that we do."

"Mary Anderson drew what would become the world's first windshield wiper. Dan: It's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees. But it's hard to solve one that almost no one sees. Steve Jobs challenged us to see our products through the eyes of the customer, Dan says."
"""We ran that product for over two hours. We ran it for about 30 minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive's going to be working years later for the customer after they  pull it out of the box"" ""We're not going to let that  happen to our product,"" he says."
"The TED Talk is hosted by TED Talk presenter and product designer, John Sutter. Sutter: ""There are invisible problems all around us, ones we can solve. But first we need to see them, to feel them"" Sutter offers tips on how to fight habituation."
"In the 1970s, the energy crisis struck, and customers started thinking about how to save energy. Instead of just turning up and down, you now had to program it. So you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time. Now that seemed great. But it turned out that no one saved any energy."
Thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and focused on that programming step. They put a machine-learning algorithm in instead of the programming that would simply watch when you turned it up and down. And you know what? It worked. People are saving energy  without any programming.
"The company's job is to make products that are easy to install for all of our customs themselves without professionals.

"Strawberry Mansion was labeled ""low-performing and persistently dangerous"" due to its low test scores and high number of weapons, drugs, assaults and arrests. The halls were dim and dark from poor lighting. There were tons of piles of broken old furniture and desks in the classrooms."
"Strawberry Mansion High School is a low-income, low-performing school in North Philadelphia. Principal: ""I was not going to be afraid to address anything that was not good for children"" ""I am a leader, so I know I cannot do anything alone,"" principal says. ""For far too many schools, for kids who live in poverty, their schools are not schools at all"""
"Strawberry Mansion was removed from the Persistently Dangerous List after five years on the list. The school's new principal created a ""non-negotiables"" program to promote positive behavior. The program included a variety of start and end times, remediation and extracurricular activities."
"After one year, state data revealed that our scores have grown by 171 percent in Algebra and 107 percent in literature. My students have problems: social, emotional and economic problems you could never imagine. Some of them are parents themselves, and some are completely alone. If nobody told you they loved you today, you remember I do."
"Every moment is a teachable moment. I remind them of those core values of focus, tradition, excellence, integrity and perseverance. And I end every announcement the same: ""If nobody told you they loved you today, you remember I do, and I always will"""
"When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato, I am interacting with reality, but that reality is not ared tomato and is nothing like a red tomatoes. When I describe a lion or a steak, I'm interacting with Reality, but Reality is not lion or steak. Reality is the real source of cause and effect in the world -- not brains, not neurons."
"Theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare: Dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth, it's about having kids. Once we let go of our massively intuitive but massively false assumption about the nature of reality, it opens up new ways to think about life's greatest mystery."
"Darwin: Our perceptions have been shaped not to show us reality as it is. But that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics, he says. Darwin: What's true about perception may not be true about math and logic. He says we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time."
"phthalmologists say a third of the brain's cortex is engaged in vision. The eye is like a 130-megapixel camera, according to neuroscientists. The brain is made up of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses. It takes a picture of objective reality as it is seen by the eye."
" Neuroscientists tell us that they are creating, in real time, all the shapes, objects, colors, and motions that we see. But that doesn't explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision."
" neuroscientists say that we don't just construct, we reconstruct. Those of our ancestors who saw more accurately had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately. So, when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato, that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of a real red tomato."
"Australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles. The males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate. They lose all interest in the real females. The species almost went extinct. It looked like they saw reality as it is, but apparently not. Evolution had given them a hack."

"Physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around. We all see a cube because we all, each one of us, constructs the cube that we see. The same is true of all physical objects."
"Theory of evolution is telling us that once again, we're wrong. We're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences. It's as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetle. Why? Because we're blind to our own blindnesses."
"The Bunn family's home in Braddock, Pennsylvania, was destroyed by the War on Drugs. The Bunn's home was the site of the city's first steel mill, which was built in the 19th century.

"An evolutionary biologist at Purdue University named William Muir studied chickens. He was interested in productivity, but it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs. So what is it that makes some groups obviously more successful and more productive than others? A team at MIT took to research."
"Arup, one of the world's most successful engineering firms, was commissioned to build the equestrian center for the Beijing Olympics. Arup believes that the culture of helpfulness is central to their success. In groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other, ideas can flow and grow."
"What drives helpfulness is people getting to know each other, says David Walliams. Companies don't have ideas; only people do. What motivates people are the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other. ""What matters is the mortar, not just the bricks,"" he says."
"Social capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust. The term comes from sociologists who were studying communities that proved particularly resilient in times of stress.

"For decades, the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in 10,000. In the 1990s, the numbers started to skyrocket. Fundraising organizations like Autism Speaks routinely refer to autism as an epidemic. 132 kids in California got the measles by either visiting Disneyland or being exposed to someone who'd been there."
"Leo Kanner classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis caused by cold and unaffectionate parents. By the 1950s, as the world's leading authority on the subject, he declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa."
"Autism became a source of shame and stigma for families, and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good. Lorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London who thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting were ""bloody stupid"" She and her colleague Judith Gould undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population."
Hans Asperger ran a combination clinic and residential school in Vienna in the 1930s. He viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability. Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare.
"Autistic people reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved by the next medical breakthrough. Autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world. The normal human brain is easily distractable, obsessively social, and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail."

"Writer's great uncle died in the last days of the pre-antibiotic era. People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance. Bacteria compete against each other for resources, for food, by manufacturing lethal compounds."
"In 2000, the CDC identified a single case in a hospital in North Carolina of an infection resistant to all but two drugs. The gene that creates that resistance, known as NDM, has now spread from India into China, Asia, Africa, Europe and Canada. In the United States and Europe, 50,000 people a year die of infections which no drugs can help."
"A recent study estimates that without antibiotics, one out of ever six would die. Without that protection, we'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body. We'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor. The first person to receive penicillin, a British policeman named Albert Alexander, was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye."
"In the United States, possibly 80 percent of the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals, not to humans. In much of the developing world, most antibiotics still are. And because bacteria can pass their DNA to each other like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport, there is no knowing where it will spread."
"""I hope this evil can be averted,"" says the doctor. ""It takes pharmaceutical chemistry 10 years to derive a new drug,"" he says. ""We could build gatekeeping into drug order systems,"" he adds. ""Those are the tech solutions"""
"Antibiotic resistance is a habit. We all know how hard it is to change a habit, but as a society, we've done that in the past. People used to toss litter into the streets, used to not wear seatbelts. We don't do those things anymore. We could change social norms around antibiotic use too."
"The average commute time in the U.S. is 50 minutes. That's about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day. The average life expectancy of a person is 162 lifetimes spent every day, wasted, just getting from A to B. We should do something about that."
"CNN's John Defterios talks about the differences between self-driving cars and driver assistance systems. He says the first test of a self- driving car was let regular people use it. The people inside the car were ""eye-opening,"" Defterio says."
"In the last decade, we've started trying to make the car smarter to fix that bug, the driver. The better the technology gets, the less reliable the driver is going to get. If we want a self-driving car, we need a technology curve that looks like this."
"Human drivers make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents about once every 100,000 miles in America. A self-driving system is probably making decisions about 10 times per second, so order of magnitude, that's about 1,000 times per mile."
"The car uses a map and its sensor data to understand where it is in the world. It then layer on top of that what it sees in the moment. The car then predicts what's going to happen, such as a truck making a lane change."
Vehicles have to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well. 1.2 million people are killed on the world's roads every year. The way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles. We could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time and understand what they look like.
"CNN's iReport crew drove through Mountain View, California, a couple of months ago. They encountered a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road. Their vehicles were able to encounter that, slow down, and drive safely."
Automakers are working on a self-driving car that could be on the road by 2018. The technology is being tested in three million miles of simulators every day. The company is looking forward to the day when the technology can be used on the roads.

"The circular economy has the ability to inspire young people. Young people see the economy through a circular lens, they see brand new opportunities. They can use their creativity and knowledge to rebuild the entire system. It's there for the taking right now, and the faster we do this the better."
"The machine has been taught to see basketball events with the eyes of a coach. It can now understand complex events like down screens and wide pins. The machine has also been taught post-ups, and pick-and-rolls, and isolations."
"With machine learning, we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know. So we go to the machine and say, ""Good morning, machine. Here are some pick-and-rolls, and here are some things that are not. Please find a way to tell the difference"""
"In modern basketball, the pick-and-roll is perhaps the most important play. Knowing how to run it, and knowing how to defend it, is basically a key to winning and losing most games. It turns out that this dance has a great many variations and identifying the variations is really the thing that matters."
"""We can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in"" ""It's much more than the pick-and-roll. It's a very complex system that can predict a lot of things"" ""We can see that if I'm standing far away, that's a good shot"""
"The TED Talk uses a bubble chart to show the quality of a player's shot. People on the left take difficult shots, on the right, they take easy shots. People who are good are at the top, bad at the bottom. A player takes shots that an average NBA player would make 49 percent of the time."
"The NBA's Ray Allen missed a three-pointer in the final seconds of a championship game. His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound, passed it to another teammate named Ray Allen. The team recreated that moment at their weekly basketball game about 3 weeks ago."
"Daria's three-pointer had a nine percent chance of happening in the NBA. ""I'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen. It was four,"" says coach Jeff Van Gundy. ""What we're doing is turning our athletes into -- you probably guessed it -- moving dots"""
"We're moving in our homes, in our offices, as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world. We've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data, it's hard to deal with and not that interesting. But there are things that, for example, basketball coaches want to know."
"Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable. In these initiation camps, you are taught how to sexually please a man. There is this special day, which they call ""Very Special Day"" where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp."

"Abortion is hotly debated, but it's still rare for women to talk about it. There are two main ways to get started. One is to listen closely. The other way is to share stories. This isn't just about abortion. It's so many important issues."
"""Pro-voice"" works on hard issues like immigration, religious tolerance, violence against women. It also works on deeply personal topics that might only matter to you and your immediate family and friends. Listening and storytelling are the hallmarks of pro-voice practice."
"There is no perfect time and no perfect place to start a difficult conversation. If we truly listen to one another, we will hear things that demand that we shift our own perceptions. There's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple."
"When we reflect the language of the person who is sharing their own story, we are conveying that we are interested in understanding who they are and what they're going through. So, another way to be pro-voice is to share your story with someone else, who might actually make a different decision."
"Pro-voice creates a culture that values what makes us human, our flaws and our imperfections. It generates empathy that we need to overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another. Pro-voice is about the real stories of real people making an impact on the way abortion is understood and discussed."
The author is the middle child of 11 children. She was born on the third anniversary of Roe vs. Wade. The author's parents were devout Christians. She says she is proud of her family's history of support for each other and other people.

She says she was surprised to find women in her faith who were leaders, who were innovative and strong. Khadija: The decision maker, the person who gets to control the message, is sitting at the table in every single world faith."
"In 2011, the Libyan revolution broke out, and her family was on the front lines. ""It was the first time that I felt it was not only acceptable for me to be involved, but it was encouraged,"" she says. ""The only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion"""
"In 2012 and 2013, I led the largest and most widespread campaign in Libya to promote women's rights. I used verses from the Quran and sayings of the Prophet, such as ""The best of you is the best to their family"" The campaign has been replicated internationally."
"Ilyse Hogue: ""I remain a very strong believer that women's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive"" ""We have to stop giving up our position, because by remaining silent, we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide,"" she says. ""Almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong,"" she adds."
"The TED Talk is a thought experiment on the effects of heroin on the human body. The author, who has a history of drug addiction, thought he knew what would happen. He was shocked to learn that the drug is actually much more addictive than he first thought."
Psychologist Bruce Alexander carried out an incredible experiment in the '70s. He put a rat in a cage and gave it water laced with heroin or cocaine. The rat almost always preferred the drug water and almost always killed itself. Alexander says the idea of addiction we've all got in our heads comes from similar experiments.
"In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water. They almost never use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose. But fortunately, there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the same time. In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin. It turns out they didn't go to rehab."
"Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other. If you can't do that, because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief. That might be gambling, that might be pornography."
"In the U.S., addicts are made to wear t-shirts saying, ""I was a drug addict"" In Portugal, the government decided to decriminalize all drugs, including heroin. The move could have a huge impact on the country's drug problem."
"CNN's John Defterios meets with addicts in Portugal to talk about their recovery. He says they have found a new way of dealing with their addictions. Defterio: ""We live in a culture where people feel really vulnerable to all sorts of things"""
"The number of close friends the average American believes they can call on in a crisis has been declining steadily since the 1950s. We've traded floorspace for friends, we've traded stuff for connections, and the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been."
"""I love you whether you're using or you're not,"" the singer says to addicts. ""I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them, because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety"" ""I want to make a difference in the lives of people who are struggling with addiction,"" she says."
"The date-a-thon was advertised as the world's largest speed dating event. Participants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling. ""If you could be any kind of animal, what would you be?"" one man asked."
"Clifford said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth, and we complimented each other's teeth. William was really difficult to talk to. Alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him. Craig told me he didn't think I was willing to be vulnerable."
"""I didn't feel a particular connection with any of the men,"" she says. ""The most beautiful thing to me is the quality of vulnerability,"" she adds. ""That's what I'm looking for in a partner. That's what makes me want to keep going"""
Alec Soth met Bob and Trudy on a blind date when she was still in high school. They said they weren't particularly attracted to each other when the first met. The picture I made that day ended up becoming one of my best-known portraits.
"Stacey Baker: I've always been obsessed with how couples meet. The world is hard, and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people, she says. Baker: My favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne. They simultaneously pulled out of their wallets the exact same photograph."
"Scientists use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure of our nervous systems to how our genes and DNA work. Insects seem like they do everything that people do. They meet, they mate, they fight, they break up. They do so with what looks like love or animosity."
"Female aphids can make little, tiny clones of themselves without ever mating. Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives. They use these devices to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with."
"The males of katydids are very picky about who they mate with. They give the female something called a nuptial gift. The gift is very nutritious and the female eats it during and after mating. The bigger it is, the better off the male is, because that means more time for his sperm to drain into her body."
"The ancient Greeks couldn't figure out the drones' sex. They found it difficult to believe that any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female. Even today, my students call every animal they see, including insects, a male."
"Scientists use white rats or fruit flies as stand-ins for all other animals, including people. The idea is that what's true for a person will also be true for the white rat. Scientists use males, in any species, as though they are the model system. The way things are supposed to be."
"Insects have little brains, so it's hard to think of them as people. They're more numerous than any other kind of animal. They make us question what's normal and what's not. The allure of another world is part of why they're so popular."
"""Can I work while I have cancer? Can I make love?"" is a common question. ""A cure, whichever it is, will have to deal with the whole of me,"" he says. ""It's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer,"" he adds."
"Italian artist Francesca Fini has been diagnosed with brain cancer. Fini created a website called La Cura to share her medical data. The website went viral, with more than 500,000 hits in a matter of days. The word ""cure"" can mean many things in different cultures, she says."
"In Western cultures, when you have cancer, it's as if you disappear in a way. With all this information and support, I was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons, traditional doctors, oncologists, and several hundred volunteers. Together, we were able toform a strategy for my own cure in many languages, according to many cultures."
"Before the operation, we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor, to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid. Thousands of people shared their stories, their experiences. Doctors got to talk with people they don't usually consult when they think about cancer."
"Graffiti artist Yves Saint-Germain is known for his use of Arabic calligraphy. He has painted a minaret in Tunisia and a concrete wall in Cape Town, South Africa. He says the message of his work is universal and can be understood by anyone."
"In Paris, a man asked for his wall to be painted in Arabic. ""I'm really proud of my culture, and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork,"" he says. ""Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door, but for me, it's more an invitation"""
"""I want to make the world a better place,"" says the author. ""I want it to be a better world,"" he says. ""It's time for a new generation of people to come out of the shadows,"" he adds. ""We need to make a change"""
"The world is changed by our maps of the world. The way that we choose -- sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise, also shapes the map of our lives. The world would be a different place if we projected Europe to show it in its actual size. I believe that what we map changes the life we lead."
"When he was a kid, Michael Jackson was a terrible student. He says he felt like education was a series of hurdles he had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood. When he was in tenth grade, he went to a boarding school, where he became a learner. Jackson: ""I found myself in a community of learners"""
"""I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets,"" he says. ""I learned some physics, I learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation"" ""It's true that I don't use most of them for my ""job,"" but that's not what it's about"""
"In 2006, author Ze Frank quit his job to learn more about cartography. He met a man who helped him understand the concept of an infinite set. After meeting Ze Frank, he decided to write a book about his experiences. The book is called ""Ze Frank's Map of the World"""
"Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built in the middle of a huge, hot desert. Almost everything here was brought from somewhere else -- the sort of rocks, the trees, the waterfalls. John Green: Ze isn't just a great public intellectual, he's also a brilliant community builder."
The Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics. The Higgs field plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force. The most interesting communities of learners are growing up on the Internet right now.
"""Smarter Every Day"" is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at what people are learning on YouTube. This week, Jarrett looks at a YouTube video about abstract mathematics. Jarrett also talks about the conservation of angular momentum and, since it's YouTube, cats."
"JG: YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet. But in fact, if you go on comments for these channels, what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter, he says. JG: You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement."
"Homo sapiens are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers. The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level; it's on the collective level. Other animals, like the social mammals, can cooperate much more flexibly, but they do so only in small numbers."
"Humanity's greatest achievements have been based on the ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. This is something chimpanzees cannot do. Just imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees. It would be 'complete madness', says Sir Chris Woodhead."
"Humans use their imaginations to create their own reality. They don't have to obey the rules of the world. They can create a new reality by inventing their own. This is how they became rulers of the planet. It's not always nice, but it's effective."
"Human rights are just a story that we've invented, says the author. Human rights are not some biological effect about homo sapiens, he says. The only place you find rights is in the stories that we have invented and spread around."
The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations. They are not an objective reality. The same is true of the economic field. The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations. These are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers.
"CNN's Richard Quest says money is the only story everybody believes. Quest: ""I can take this worthless piece of paper, give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before, and get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat"" Quest: Money, in fact, is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans."
"Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have a new book out. After Sapiens, you wrote another one, and it's out in Hebrew, but not yet translated into ... YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution, we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat."
"As computers become better and better in more and more fields, there is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us in most tasks. The big political and economic question of the 21st century will be, ""What do we need humans for?"""
"Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia. I'm a gung ho entertainer. I love to cook, and in return, people invited me to their dinner parties, and to their barbecues. I also played poker every weekend. It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in."
"In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops fled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest, for North Idaho. North Idaho has more gas stations than gas stations. The St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration."
"In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia. Most white people in Whitopia are not there for explicitly racial reasons. They emigrate there for friendliness, comfort, security, safety -- reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself."
"Whitopia is a push-pull phenomenon, full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls. It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons, though it has racist outcomes. Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit, freedom, the allure of privatism."
"CNN's John Sutter traveled 27,000 miles around the U.S. to find out why white people are fleeing America. Sutter: America is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in 1970. He says the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have, the less we can confront conscious and unconscious bias."
"Lebanese Hezbollah has also set up a political party, social-service network. Hamas, known for its suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Strip. Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising, setting up profitable businesses. These activities are keys to their success."
"In the West, when we look at armed groups, we only think of the violent side. But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength, strategy or long-term vision. The more these organizations are complex and sophisticated, the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state."
"Military power can win some battles, but it will not give us peace nor stability. Filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach. Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict. Of 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011, 196 of them were between a state and a non- state actor."
"Philippe Coste: ""I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life, and it's cooler than in the movies"" ""We cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them, if we don't have the full picture,"" Coste says."
"Waldo has Asperger's, a high-functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display. Growing up, Waldo struggled to fit in socially. Waldo's personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert."
"With Asperger's, a person can have a very complex inner life. This can make basic communication a challenge for people with the condition. ""I got the help I finally needed. And after 18 months of hard work, I went on to do incredible things,"" he says."
"Asperger's can be viewed as a disadvantage, but it's also the opposite, he says. He says technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder. The app Podium, released by his company, AutismSees, has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills."
"Lucid dreaming is a way for people with autism to express their ideas. Podium allows people with ASD to visualize, design, test, and troubleshoot everything in their mind. The goal of autism-assistive technology is to remove roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding."
"""I will always remember the first time I met the girl in the blue uniform"" ""I was not their equal. And in their eyes, I was no longer their equal"" ""That's who I want to be -- someone like her, someone who uplifts other people"""
"HeForShe invites men and boys from around the world to stand in solidarity with each other and with women. The initiative is based on the idea that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us. In just three days, more than 100,000 men had signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality."
"Within a week, HeForShe created more than 1.2 billion conversations on social media. Within that first week, at least one man in every single country in the world stood up to be counted. We want concrete, systematic, structural change that can equalize the political, economic and social realities."
"Emma Watson is the founder and goodwill ambassador of HeForShe. She says the movement is tapping into women's and men's dreams. Watson: ""It is not our gender that defines us, but ultimately, our shared humanity"" She hopes the movement will help free us to realize that women and men are part of a greater whole."
"Scientists are using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes, which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells. The laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds. Before you even know it, the induced hole becomes immediately repaired."
"If successful, this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body. Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering any medication. But swallowing any medication leads to its dilution. This is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients."
"Government officials are upset that tech companies have built encryption features into their products. They believe that all communications -- emails, texts, voice calls -- all of these should be available to governments. The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop, or a drug dealer's cell phone."
"In 2009, the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks were compromised by the Chinese government. The surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece was compromised by an unknown entity. In the future, encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult. But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls could be surveilled by criminals."
"Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first. While the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority, Silicon Valley companies have not. And increasingly, over the last couple years, they have built strong encryption technology into their communications products."
"Quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s. It is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas. It gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules. Organic chemistry, scaled up in complexity, gives us molecular biology, which leads to life."
" quantum mechanics is the theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules. It underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry. But in everyday life, that quantum weirdness just dissolves away. Quantum biology is about looking for the non-trivial ideas in quantum mechanics."
"Erwin Schrödinger was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the 1920s. His work influenced Francis Crick and James Watson, the discoverers of the double-helix structure of DNA. ""If we can forget about quantum Mechanics in the macro world, then we should be able to forget about it in biology,"" he says."
"In quantum physics, a particle can pass through a wall and reappear on the other side. This is known as quantum tunneling. It's been around since the early 20th century, but is now being studied more closely. The discovery of this phenomenon has led to a new understanding of the nature of matter."
"Enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells. One of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of is by transferring subatomic particles, like electrons and indeed protons, from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling."
"The two white balls in the middle are protons, and you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond. If the two strands of DNA then separate, leading to the process of replication, and the two protons are in the wrong positions, this can lead to a mutation. Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here."
" quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria, carrying out photosynthesis. The European robin navigates by sensing the Earth's magnetic field. Inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome, which is light-sensitive. quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart, yet somehow remain in contact with each other."
"We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it. We don't know if it's the correct explanation, but wow, wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate? Quantum biology is still in it infancy."
"Vaccine development is expensive and complicated. It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine. The only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now, is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear."
"There are things we can do to remove some of these barriers. The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure. In that case, if we want vaccines, we have to provide incentives. We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us."
"Ebola has stolen all of the headlines and the fear, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: ""There is something deeply rooted about it, something which scares us and fascinates us more than other diseases"" ""We need to view this, then, as the ultimate deterrent,"" Sutter says."
"""The Triptych"" is a series of drawings made on top of layers of glass. The work was inspired by Hieronymus Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" ""It's kind of ahead of its time, they say. It's a really cool piece of art,"" says the artist."
"The Triptych is a collection of images of the world's most famous people and places. This week, CNN's John Sutter looks at the images of Jesus, the sun, the moon and the stars. The images are part of a larger project, ""The World of Jesus,"" which will air on CNN next week."
"""Psychogeographies"" is a six-year project to make 100 of these humans. Each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time."
"""Pioneer Works"" is a 3,000-pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside. ""I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas,"" he says. ""They're like cells -- they come together, they divide"""
"""We're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box,"" says the author. ""If we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely, we're all going to die real soon"" ""When it grows one percent per annum, it takes three generations to double the standard of living. And in this process, many people will be less well-off"""
"Paul Krugman: ""Productivity is not everything, but in the long run, it is almost everything"" He says the holy trinity of efficiency: clarity, measurement, accountability, make human efforts derail. ""It is to look at a relay race. It's a bit more animated, more visual and also faster"""
"The U.S. team has the fastest women on earth. They are the favorite team to win. They arrive at the finish line 3.2 meters ahead of the French team. Chryste Gaines, the second runner in the US team, is the fastest woman on Earth."
"The fastest team did not win; the slower one did, he says. Productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society. With cooperation, we can do more with less, he adds. ""This is not poetry; this is not philosophy. This is math,"" he says of the importance of cooperation."
"In the largest European economies, productivity used to grow five percent per annum in the '50s, '60s, early '70s. Management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity. We need more clarity, we need to clarify the roles, the processes."
"We pay more attention to knowing who to blame in case we fail, than to creating the conditions to succeed, he says. We are creating organizations able to fail, but in a compliant way, with somebody clearly accountable when we fail. To pass the baton, you have to do it at the right time, in the right hand, at theright speed."
"When the next runner runs super-fast, is it because she made a super effort, or because of the way the third runner passed the baton? There is no metric on earth that will give us the answer. If we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance, they will put their energy, their attention, their blood in what can get measured."
"Business has become much more complex than when the world was simpler. The more complicated the organization, the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening. People put their energy in what can get measured, at the expense of cooperation. This is what is killing productivity."
"When people don't cooperate, don't blame their mindsets, their mentalities, their personality. Is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not, if, when they cooperate, they are individually worse off? When we blame personalities instead of the clarity, the accountability, the measurement, we add injustice to ineffectiveness."
"On the dark net, you will find whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker and political activism blogs. But you'll also find the drugs markets, illegal pornography, commercial hacking services, and much more besides. In this part of the Internet, you'll not find a single lolcat, a single pop-up advert anywhere."
"You can't get to these sites with a normal browser -- they're on Tor. The only way of trusting them is if they have a good history of positive feedback. Prices tend to go down, product quality tends to go up, and they're polite."
"The Tor browser was originally a U.S. Naval intelligence tool. It's now used by 20 or so sites that are currently in operation. One site shut down 18 months ago, but not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade."
"The community came up with a solution, called multi-signature escrow payments. On purchasing my item, I would send my bitcoin to a neutral, secure third digital wallet. It then became open source, and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location."
"The Tor browser encrypts your IP address and routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software. There are now between two and three million daily users of the Tor browser, the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate, sometimes even mundane."
"Hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online. The dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle-blowers. And because of this fiendishly clever encryption system, the 20 or 30 thousand sites that operate there are incredibly difficult to shut down."
"""It is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users,"" he says. ""That's good news if you care about freedom. It's also good news for people who want to buy and sell drugs with impunity"" ""It's not one side or the other that's going to win out, but both,"" he adds."
"I'm not talking about the technology of things, profound though that is, I'm talking about another technology. I call it, ""idea technology"" -- how clever of me. In addition to creating things, science creates ideas. Science creates ways of understanding. And in the social sciences, the ways of Understanding that get created are Ways of understanding ourselves."
"The industrial revolution created a factory system in which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day's work, except for the pay at the end of the day. With ideas -- false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe that they're true."
"Anthropologist Clifford Geertz said human beings are the ""unfinished animals"" We design human nature by designing the institutions within which people live and work. How is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work that is monotonous, meaningless and soul-deadening?"
"Dying is a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact? I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying. I am asking that we make space -- physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out."
"Healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center. The effects of bad design more heartbreaking than at the end of life, where things are so distilled and concentrated. We have a monumental opportunity in front of us to rethink and redesign how we die."
"Palliative care is about comfort and living well at any stage of life, says Dr. David Perry. Perry: ""Our role as caregivers, as people who care, is to relieve suffering -- not add to the pile"" ""How we die is indeed something we can affect,"" Perry says."
"Palliative care doctor: Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another. ""Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind so many of us would make,"" he says. ""If we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time,"" he adds."
"The Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco sprinkles the body of a dead patient with flower petals. The ritual is meant to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance. ""I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them. But we ask too much of our hospitals,"" says the project's founder."
"The author spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey. One of his nurses smuggled in a snowball for him. ""Beauty can be found anywhere,"" he says. ""I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand,"" he writes."
"""We need an infrastructure to handle these seismic shifts in our population,"" he says. ""The alternative is just unacceptable,"" he adds. ""It's time to change the way we look at the world,"" he writes. ""We need a new way to look at life and death"""
"The American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction. As long as we have our senses -- even just one -- we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected. The distinction between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care."
"Theresa and her husband started a cleaning business. The couple split the money three ways. It was not a full-time gig, no one could watch the little ones all day. But it made a difference for their families. It gave them a little extra money in their pockets."
Brianna's family credits her with helping Rosie to learn English. Her mother felt hopeless and overwhelmed and alone because she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed. Theresa created a support group for parents like her. She went from feeling helpless to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter.
"BlackStar is much more than a café. It's a home for poets, musicians and artists. Baakir and his partner Nicole, with their baby girl strapped to her back, are there in the mix of it all. They've created think tanks that study issues like education, job creation and asset-building."
"At eight, I'd get myself home after school every day and do homework and chores, and wait for my mother to come home. I'd go to the corner store and buy a can of Chef ravioli, which I'd heat up on the stove. Now, I own a home in Oakland, California, and I have a retirement account. I see people who are broke but not broken."
"""I am the exception to the rule that hard work pays off,"" says John Sutter. Sutter: ""There is no such thing as hard work that doesn't pay off"" Sutter says he's seen people who work hard but don't get paid for it."
"Poverty rates haven't changed that much in the last 50 years, since the War on Poverty was launched. There are no incubators for them, no accelerators, no fellowships. How are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha really all that different from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?"
"""Let's grasp this opportunity to let go of a tired, faulty narrative,"" she says. ""Let us remember that we are magic. Individually, we don't have a lot of wealth and power, but collectively, we are unstoppable,"" she adds."
"The Truth and Reconciliation process started by elevating the voices of the unheard. ""My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in yours; we belong to a bundle of life,"" Mandela said. ""If this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all, then we need to elevate the voice of our unheard"""
Mandy Cevallos: I had no idea my blog would get so much attention when I wrote about a new relationship. She says she was surprised to find people asking about her and her new partner. She's now been asked to give talks and do radio interviews about her love life.
"CNN's John Sutter asked a group of young people to share their stories of love. They shared their experiences of being in a relationship for the first time. Sutter: ""I think it's a good idea to share your story with others"""
"The fast friends protocol is a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers. The original version of the story, the one that I tried last summer, was referenced in this article, but unfortunately it was never published. They've used it between members of the police and members of community."
"""I think when it comes to love, we are too willing to accept the short version of the story"" ""What I want from love is a guarantee, not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow"" ""I am more relaxed. I am more confident about asking for what I want"""

He says the state has a long way to go when it comes to understanding the natural world. Defterio: ""We need to make sure we don't lose sight of our natural heritage"""
"Florida's blackwater swamps are home to thousands of birds. The birds nest and mate in these old-growth swamps in these flooded forests. They then fly thousand of miles over the Gulf of Mexico into Central and South America. After the winter, the spring rolls around and they come back."
CNN's John Defterios is working on a book about the history of the Everglades. He says the area has suffered from a lack of water since the 1950s. He hopes the book will shed light on how the area was affected by climate change.
"The Everglades are responsible for the drinking water for 7 million Floridians. They also provide the agricultural fields for over 300 million Americans. The same seasonal pulse of water in the summer built the river of grass 6,000 years ago. Ironically, today, it's also responsible for over half a million acres of sugarcane."
"Mac Stone spent months planning this crazy idea. He spent over a week in the water, wading waist-deep, 9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk. The day that it finally worked, he says, ""all those months of planning, waiting, all the sunburn, mosquito bites"""
"The roseate spoonbill has had a tough time in the Everglades. The birds started out with thousands of nesting pairs in Florida Bay. At the turn of the 20th century, they got down to two -- two nesting pairs."
"The birds' behavior is intrinsically tied to the annual draw-down cycle of water in the Everglades. Their numbers were rebounding in the mid-20th century. Just as that started happening, we started draining the southern Everglade."

"The boy who lost his life to a rare form of cancer was left with only his thoughts for company. His family and friends were told to take him home and try to keep him comfortable until he died. Eventually, his mind began knitting itself back together and he was aware of everything."
"I lived in fear, and, to put it bluntly, was waiting for death to finally release me, expecting to die all alone in a care home. I would never talk to a friend. No one would ever show me tenderness. I had no dreams, no hope, nothing to look forward to."
"For more than 10 years, people who were charged with my care abused me physically, verbally and sexually. The first time it happened, I was shocked and filled with disbelief. I lived in terror, knowing it would happen again and again. I just never knew when."
"In a moment of despair and desperation, my mother turned to me and told me that I should die. I was shocked, but as I thought about what she had said, I was filled with enormous compassion and love for my mother. There were many moments when I gave up, sinking into a dark abyss."

Martin was diagnosed with a brain infection after falling ill in a care home. He was thrust into a world he didn't quite know how to function in. He discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message. It is about getting the message heard and respected.
"The first time I was told I was a man, I thought I was going to die. Now I know I'm not. I'm a man. I've been through a lot and I've learned to accept who I am. It's time to change."
"Communication is what makes us human, enabling us to connect on the deepest level with those around us. True communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world. Once, I was perceived to be an inanimate object, a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair. Today, I am so much more."
"Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation. It is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050. Already in the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year."
"Of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down. We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it. US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's."
"Scientists are trying to find a way to stop the build-up of tangles in the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers. They have found a new way to block the formation of the tangles, but it's a complex process. The first step is to find out what happens when these tangles are blocked."
"Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure. After 114 years of waiting, there's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years. But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help."
"Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide. We've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease. Help speak up for them, and help demand a cure. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes."
"The question ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" is asked of children as young as five years old. It's considered an innocuous question, posed to little kids to elicit cute replies. But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms."

"Neurons are important for learning, memory, mood and emotion, says Sandrine Lister. By the time we turn 50, we will have exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult-born neurons. Lister: If we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus, then we block certain memory abilities."
"If you just block neurogenesis, then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant. Learning will increase the production of these new neurons. Stress will decrease the production. Sleep deprivation will decrease neuroGenesis. If we want to improve memory formation or mood, or even prevent the decline associated with aging, or associated with stress."
"The environment can have an impact on the production of new neurons. The drug that stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain. The neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older, but it is still occurring."
"What you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus. Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis. Resveratrol, contained in red wine, has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons. Japanese groups are fascinated with food textures."

"The UN agreed in 2001 to halve the proportion of people living in poverty by 2015. The target was to take from a baseline of 1990, when 36 percent of the world's population lived in poverty. This year, global poverty is going to fall to 12 percent."
"The Global Goals aren't just ambitious, they're also pretty complicated. Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets and literally hundreds of indicators. Some of the goals are pretty specific -- end hunger -- others are a lot vaguer -- promote peaceful and tolerant societies."
"The Social Progress Index sums all this together using 52 indicators to create an aggregate score on a scale of 0 to 100. The highest performing country, Norway, scores 88. Central African Republic, scores 31. The average human being is living on a level of social progress about the same of Cuba or Kazakhstan today."
"The leaders of the world agreed a new set of Global Goals for the development of the. world to 2030. The best forecast comes from the US Department of Agriculture, which forecasts 3.1 percent average global economic growth over the next 15 years. If they're right, per capita GDP will be about $23,000."
"Economic growth seems to have really helped in the fight against poverty. But it doesn't seem to be having much impact on trying to get to the Global Goals. So what's going on? In a way, we're the victims of our own success."
"The world is scoring 61 on social progress, and the place we want to get to is 75. From poor countries like Rwanda to richer countries like New Zealand, we see that it's possible to get lots of social progress. If we prioritize the well-being of people, we can make a lot more progress than our GDP might expect."
"If we rely on economic growth alone, we're going to get to 62.4. We have to prioritize social progress, and really scale solutions around the world. I believe the Global Goals are a historic opportunity, because the world's leaders have promised to deliver them."

"Ambien was released on the market over 20 years ago. The Food and Drug Administration recommended cutting the dose in half for women only. Women metabolize the drug at a slower rate than men, causing them to wake up with more of the active drug in their system."
"Women's health became synonymous with reproduction: breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy. The concept was challenged by the medical community and by public health policymakers in the 1980s. Since that time, evidence has come to light that shows us just how different men and women are in every way."
"More women than men complain of ""just not feeling right,"" ""can't seem to get enough air in"" The blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men. The test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack is not as good in women."

"The wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time, October 7, 2014, in the French city of Calais by the English Channel. The customer paid cash. There was no surveillance footage from the shop. So it became a cold case. But the conversation has begun, and together we can all learn."
"Shadi Omar Kataf and Mouaz Al Balkhi drowned trying to swim across the English Channel. The two young men fled the war in Syria, ended up stuck in Calais, bought wetsuits and drowned. Between 3,500 and 5,000 people are living here under horrible conditions."
"About half a million refugees have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year, and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais. But who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants, because we usually do that in statistics."
Mouaz was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in 1991. His father spent 11 years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria. Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus. He made at least 12 failed attempts to cross the English Channel by hiding in a truck.
"Mouaz and his family were killed in the Syrian civil war. They lived in an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk. Out of a population of 150,000, only 18,000 are believed to still be in the area."
"Shadi and one of his sisters fled to Libya after the fall of Gaddafi. He fell in love with the ocean, and hoped to find work as a diver in Italy. But reality was not that easy. He was found 800 kilometers away in a wetsuit on a Norway beach."
A better life for all of us is to be able to live in peace with ourselves and our loved ones. We can't do that if we live in fear of our future. We need to be free from fear of what the future holds for us.

"A few years ago, with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier, I invented a new technology for editing genomes. The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider. The CRISPR technology allows scientists to make changes to the DNA in cells that could allow us to cure genetic disease."
"The Cas9 gene-editing system can be used to repair DNA breaks. The technology is similar to a computer program that can be programmed to fix a typo. It could be used in the treatment of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, for example."
The first applications of the CRISPR technology are going to happen in the blood. The technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA affect either a tissue or an entire organism.
"Jennifer Doudna: ""This raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider"" She and her colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the CRISPR technology. ""This is no longer science fiction. Genome-engineered animals and plants are happening right now,"" she says."
"JD: I hope that we can air the views of many different individuals and stakeholders who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly. BG: Is there a possible split happening in the science community about this? JD: In the end, this technology will be used for human genome engineering, but I think to do that without careful consideration and discussion of the risks would not be responsible."
"As a Deaf person living in a world of sound, it's as if I was blindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms without ever questioning them. I learn and mirror that behavior. At the same time, I've learned that I create sound, and I've seen how people respond to me."
"In Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound. A typical staff contains five lines. The lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears. If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a ""p"" in the score, you need to play softer."

"In American Sign Language, there are different ways to say the same thing. For example, the sign for ""day"" is ""all day"" If you repeat the sign over and over, it becomes a piece of music. The same thing can be done with other words and phrases."
"French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s. As time went by, mixed with local signs, it evolved into the language we know today as ASL. Common time is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure."
"The International [Sign] is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world. The sign for ""to fall in love"" in ASL is the same as ""common time"" and ""enlightenment"" In ASL, the head and the chest are used to convey different meanings."
"The world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s. Why not now? Why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees? And why, the root question, is so little being done to stop the wars, the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of Europe?"

"Syrian refugee, 19, was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages. Doaa and Bassem were on a boat heading to Sweden. A boat with 10 men on board started shouting at them, hurling insults, throwing sticks. The boat sped away in anger, and then came back and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat."
"Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank, and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller. Around 100 people survived initially, and they started coming together in groups, praying for rescue. Doaa and Bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water."
"The Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders, but over seven million people are on the run inside the country. ""They feel that the richer world has done too little to support them,"" says Bassem. ""Even rich European countries could never handle such an influx without massive investment"""
"Doaa, a 19-year-old refugee, found herself in charge of two little baby kids. She tried her best to amuse them, to sing to them, and to say words from the Quran. Around them, the bodies were bloating and turning black."
"Doaa saw two planes crossing the sky. She waved her arms, hoping they would see her. But the planes were gone. Doaa looked down and asked, ""What of Malek?"" But she was also full of hope, because the little boy had survived."
"Masa survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink. Doaa was in another hospital on Crete, thin, dehydrated. An Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released. Masa's uncle, a Syrian refugee, made it to Sweden with his family."
The Academy of Athens gave her an award of bravery. She wants to reunite with her family in Sweden. Why wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe? Why couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden? She is an extraordinary survivor. She deserves a second chance.
"CNN's John Sutter talks with Nobel Prize winner Danny Kahneman about prospective hindsight. Sutter: In a pre-mortem, you look ahead and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong. He says there are some things you can do to prevent those things from happening. Satter: You can designate a place for things that are easily lost or damaged."
"There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus, that evolved over tens of thousands of years. It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts. When you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol. Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the importance of a rational decision-making process. Sutter: ""There's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make"" Sutter says the NNT is the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery before one person is helped."
"GlaxoSmithKline estimates 90 percent of drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people. 300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented. Side effects include debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress."
"You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by it. The most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49. 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped. The side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients."
"The brain under stress releases cortisol, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down. The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be, to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things from happening."
"The robot collects plastic bits from the ocean and uses them to create an image of the plastic. The robot then uses a computer to measure the size of each particle to estimate how much plastic there is in the water. The project was documented on Instructables, a website for inventors called Instructables."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh. He found a child cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed in the forest. The water was brown, the mud was brown and oil was brown; it was hard to see what was in the water. Defterio built a prototype of a spectrometer that can help identify what's in water."
Scientists have been measuring the radioactivity in the area around the Fukushima nuclear power plant since the disaster. This year's expedition was the closest civilians have been to the plant. The scientists are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler they've invented and built.

A group of young artists in Hong Kong have created an art installation in the shadow of the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. The project is a collaboration between the Academy of Arts and the University of Hong Kong. It is the first of its kind in the world and aims to raise awareness of the dangers of surveillance.
"The antennas created an open and free Wi-Fi communication network in Berlin. Text messages, voice chat, file sharing -- anything could be sent anonymously. Over 15,000 messages were sent. ""This is the NSA's Achilles heel. Open Networks."""
"CNN's ""Making Love"" series looks at the power of the internet and social media. This week, the team explores the impact of social media on the lives of ordinary people. They also look at how the internet has changed the way we communicate with each other."
"The Hotel Gelem is a real hotel in the government district of Berlin. Visitors can stay in the hotel and live with the Roma families. The hotel is a symbol of the gap between the privileged and the excluded. The project was named after the hotel in Freiburg, Germany."
"Australian asylum seekers are detained by Australia without trial, sometimes for years. The interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system are veiled by the Australian authorities. From these contexts was born an installation in the art space of the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane."
Communication systems in remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece are significant. Information on the Internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being censored. The right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there. It is only in exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion.
"Greece's island of Lesbos is home to thousands of refugees. Many of them are forced to sleep on the streets. They are denied access to services such as buses and hotels. ""We need to start talking to them about their struggle,"" says Mathias."
"The tapir is one of the most amazing animals on the face of the Earth. They play a major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest. Their habitat is being destroyed, and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution."
"The Atlantic Forest in Brazil is one of the most threatened biomes in the world. The destruction of the Atlantic Forest began in the early 1500s, when the Portuguese first arrived in the eastern part of South America. Many people around the world do not know what a tapir is. Tapirs do not eat ants. Never."
"""I have dedicated the past 20 years of my life to the research and conservation of tapirs in Brazil,"" he says. ""I have to say that starting this new program in the Cerrado was a bit of a slap in the face"""
The Cerrado is home to the world's largest population of tapirs. The animals are often killed for their meat. Conservationists are trying to find ways to save the animals. They are putting reflective stickers on the collars of the animals to help drivers see them.
"""I have this huge network of supporters behind me, and there is no way I'm ever going to stop. And I'll keep doing this for the hundreds of tapirs that I've had the pleasure to meet over the years,"" he says."
"A solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy. This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone. The data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED, so if the incoming light fluctuates, so does the energy harvested from the solar cell."
CNN's John Sutter uses a solar cell to send a video to a camera. Sutter says the light from the camera can't be seen by the human eye. He says the technology could be used to make the Internet more accessible to all.
"Solar cells can be used to connect to the Internet in a variety of ways. The technology is called Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity. It is being trialled in the UK and could be rolled out in the U.S. within two years."
"CNN's John Defterios asks students why they search for facts. He says to get to knowledge, you have to bring 10 or 20 or 100 facts to the table. ""This is where we become human. This is when we start to argue, to form society,"" he says."

Nepal is one of the most LGBT-friendly countries in the world. The country has made strides in the fight against discrimination. The government has also taken steps to make it easier for people to come out and say they are gay or transgender.
"Nepal's supreme court gave the decision for the government to give transgender identity cards and same-sex marriage on December 21, 2007. In their minds, my sexual orientation was America's fault. I had to come up with a strategy to just pee in peace."
"Prince Manvendra came out on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show,"" very internationally. His parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family. We sat down with him and talked to him about why he decided to come out."
"In Kenya, 89 percent of people who come out to their families are disowned. Homosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration. In Kenya, we met the soft-spoken David Kuria. He became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate."
"In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America and the 10th in the world to adopt marriage equality. By the time we finished our not-so-straight journey, we had traveled 50,000 miles and logged 120 hours of video footage."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled around the world to meet people who are fighting for gay rights. He says there are stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world. Defterio: ""In the end, we believe, love will win out"""
"JC: ""We are the most compassionate, most violent, most creative and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet"" JC: ""I knew the world was far from perfect, but surely not every gay story was tragic"" ""Love is not the thing that makes us human.

"""We paint animals to show them that we are not alone,"" says artist. ""It's still true that a neuron, a nerve cell, looks the same in a crayfish, a bird or you"" ""We're going to ask another question. Are we capable of using what we have to simply let them continue?"""
"If you give a crayfish the same drug used to treat anxiety disorder in humans, it relaxes and comes out and explores. If a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral, it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping. A pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them."
"When evolution makes something new, it uses the parts it has in stock, off the shelf, before it fabricates a new twist. Killer whales teach and killer whales share food. Sea otters use tools and they take time away from what they're doing to show their babies what to do, which is called teaching."
"The elephant has the same skeleton as the killer whale, as do we. They know us better than we know them. We recognize affection. Courtship is courtship. We see helping where help is needed. But why is the question always do they love us?"
"When you get general anesthesia, it makes you unconscious, which means you have no sensation of anything. The oldest form of empathy is contagious fear. Empathy is old, but empathy, like everything else in life, comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration."
"Human empathy is far from perfect, says Carl Safina. Safina: We round up empathic creatures, we kill them and we eat them. He says attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species is the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling."
"In 1980, there were vast strongholds of elephant range in Central and Eastern Africa. They once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope. Humans not only can feel grief, we create an awful lot of it."
"In the 1920s, the U.S. killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border. Two of their adults were killed, including the mother, which we sometimes call the alpha female. The rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry."
"The mystery is, why don't they hurt us more than they do? We can look at evolution and we can watch what they do. The alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family. He lost his territory, his hunting support, the members of his family and his mate."
"CNN's Jim Boulden asks: Why is it so hard to tell when a dolphin is dead or alive? He says it's because we don't know how to tell the difference between a human and a dolphin. ""It's like we can't tell what's going on,"" he says. ""We just don't understand"""

"The Interlace is a system of communal spaces stacked to more and more individual and private spaces. The aim is to open up a spectrum between the collective and the individual. The project pays a lot of attention to sustainability, especially in the tropics where the sun is the most important."
"The project was commissioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation of the Mayor of London. The building is a prototype of what a space of culture and media could look like today. The idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions, some international ones, to create a new system of synergies."
The Centre Pompidou is a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity. The idea was to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted. The public will be able to script their own reading of these narratives and their own experience.
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a documentary about food banks in the UK. He says the project has been inspired by the idea of arranging things in a way that is both functional and experiential.

Graphic communication has been around for a long time. But it was only recently that it became possible to use it to communicate with others. This article was originally published in The Guardian. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.
"Over the last century, more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent. They provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination of these early artists. The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites, there was a large number of them where it was very vague."
"There are only 32 geometric signs across a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe. 65 percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period. Some signs start out strong, before losing popularity and vanishing, while other signs are later inventions."
"There's just not enough characters at this point to have represented all of the words in the spoken language. Nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet. The oldest systems of graphic communication in the world emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago."
"""We have to tell these people that the world has changed. Now we want to produce the fish ourselves,"" he says. ""We are working towards that, and yes, the answer would be to enhance. In order to increase our rate of return, we have to become more involved"""

"At the beginning of this year, the Cyclone Pam, which destroyed Vanuatu, touched our two southernmost islands, and all of Tuvalu was underwater. The Japanese are interested in building floating islands. But Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands: the Gilbert Group on the west, the Phoenix Islands in the middle, and the Line Islands in east."

"The Pacific island nation of New Zealand is dependent on fishing for much of its economy. The country's rate of consumption of fish is perhaps the highest in the world, says the country's prime minister. He says he was ""very angry, very frustrated and then depressed"" at the U.N. climate change talks."
"Kiribati has one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world. It remains relatively healthy for some species, but not all. ""I can assure you, politically, locally, it was not easy, but I was convinced that we had to do this"""
"Forgoing commercial fishing in the Phoenix Islands protected area would mean a loss of revenue. For any vessel to come in to fish for a day, we have raised the fee from $6,000 and $8,000 to $10,000, $12,000."

"In America, women make up 47 percent of the workforce. In 40 percent of American households a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner. The babies that women, many of them working women, are having today will one day fill our workforce, protect our shores."
"88 percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave after they have a baby. Because of the way it's structured, all kinds of exceptions, half of new mothers are ineligible for it. Of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave, most women can't afford to take much of it."
"The shorter a woman's leave after having a baby, the more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders. Suicide is the second most common cause of death in a women's first year post-pregnancy. There's a little club of countries in the world that offer no national paid leave to new mothers."
"The U.S. is sending millions of women back to work every year. The cost is disproportionately high for women of color. ""We have decided, not an accident, to pass these costs on to working mothers and their babies,"" says the president of the National Council of Negro Women."
"The birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable is 2.1 live births per woman. We need women to have babies, and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that. It is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth to offer national paid leave."
"We have to stop framing this as a mother's issue, or even a women's issue. We need to question why we're told that this can't work when we see it work all over the world. We have taken the fish out of the oceans and we have added in fertilizer, diseases, oil, pollution."
"Jeremy Jackson: Many people don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from. He says the ""slippery slope to slime"" is not a metaphor, but a reality. Jackson: We need to change the way we think about the world's reefs."
"The world's coral reefs are home to millions of species of animals. The diversity is what stabilizes the systems, and it's where we're finding our new medicines. Corals can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH. They can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound."
"Cuba is one of the most biodiverse places in the world, but its coral reefs are under threat. Scientists are trying to figure out how to save the reefs from extinction. They have found that baby corals may be able to adapt more easily to human life."
"The pillar coral is so rare, it was listed as a threatened species on the endangered species list. Scientists had never found a baby pillar coral in over 30 years of research surveys. Scientists are testing bacteria to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab."
"Coral reefs provide food, income and food security for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Scientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos, to get them to settle, maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures."
Coral reefs are important in the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs. The structures that they build protect our shorelines from storm surge and waves. Coral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi. They're providing us with art and food and medicine.

"World War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish. The technology that we perfected during World War II -- sonar, lightweight polymers -- were redirected towards fish. And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity, quadrupling in the course of time."
"Shrimp in the wild -- as a wild product -- is a terrible product. 5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish are regularly killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market. The place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats -- in mangrove forests."
"The next most consumed seafood in America, and also throughout the West, is tuna. Tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture. The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it, ""The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas"""
"There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut. Dams stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds. So as a result, we've turned to aquaculture, and salmon is one the most successful. When they first started farming salmon, it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon."
"Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet. It has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon. It's not just fish that we're feeding fish to, but also chickens and pigs. The byproducts of chickens -- feathers, blood, bone -- get ground up and fed to fish."
The Filet-O-Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock. 2 to 3 billion pounds of fish are taken out of the sea every single year. Tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago. It goes from an egg to an adult in nine months.
"CNN's John Sutter looks at ways to save salmon. Sutter: Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon? Could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen? Sutter also looks at bivalves, particularly mussels, as fuel efficient."
"Aquacultured fish could be a net gain of marine protein for us, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter says the fish would have to be vegetarian, fast growing, adaptable to a changing climate. The fish would also have to have that oily fish profile, he says."
"It's not an unusual human characteristic to reduce the natural world down to very few elements. We did it before, 10,000 years ago, when we came out of our caves. We know from ice core that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn't smooth."
"The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon, about 60 times more than is in the atmosphere. It also acts to transport heat across the equator, and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity. If we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea, we really need to get down there and start to explore."
"Coral is found on the seafloor of Antarctica, thousands of meters below the sea. The coral is made of different forms of calcium carbonate growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain. There are brittle stars growing on these corals, which are fossilized."
"With maps that we make on board, we get about 100-meter resolution, enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment, but not enough to see very much. To do that, we need to fly remotely-operated vehicles about five meters off the seafloor. We go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships."
"An organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years. As it grows, it takes in chemicals from the ocean. And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton, we can then go back and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past."
"Scientists use uranium and thorium in coral to study ancient ocean feedbacks. The decay of uranium in the coral helps them to find out about the rates and dates of what's going on in the ocean. The overall features are extremely easy to understand, and that's what we want to get at."
"The Southern Ocean is one of the strongest currents in the world, flowing from west to east. It's very turbulently mixed, and this allows CO2 and heat to exchange with the atmosphere. The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight, but we don't know why."
"CNN's John Defterios takes you through the history of the world's oceans. He shows how deep the ocean is, and how it has changed over time. Defterio: ""There are massive sea mountains down there that nobody's ever seen before"""
"With conventional cabin air, sneezes go right into people's faces. ""The first thing I thought was, ""This is no good"" So I actually conducted more than 32 different simulations and ultimately, I came up with this solution,"" he says."
"With this, we're able to reduce pathogen transmission by about 55 times, and increase fresh-air inhalation by about 190 percent. Instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns, we can create these walls of air that come down in-between the passengers."
"In the past, the SARS epidemic actually cost the world about 40 billion dollars. In the future, a big disease outbreak could actually cost in excess of three trillion dollars. With advanced computing and how developed our Internet is, it's really the golden era for innovation."
"Half a million people die in the UK each year, and of those, around a quarter will want to be buried. UK, like many Western European countries, is running out of burial space, especially in the major cities. Main causes are population growth, the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full."
"If you want to start your own cemetery in the UK, you kind of can. There are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors. The cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot for the next 50 years."
"There's almost no regulation in the UK on how much land can be used to build a cemetery. But if you have a large plot of land, you can build a small cemetery. The idea is that the cemetery will be able to serve as a base for other businesses."
"In the UK, only about 30 percent of people have ever talked to anyone about their wishes around death. In Venice, an exhibition on death and architecture in Venice was called ""Death in Venice"" The government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things like burying a death. But when it comes to our cities, there's much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine."
"The exhibition was designed to be quite playful, so that people would literally engage with it. One of our exhibits was an interactive map of London which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death. As you wave your hand across the map, the name of the piece of real estate -- the building or cemetery -- is revealed."
"Jane Fonda says she uses social media to stay in touch with her friends. Fonda: ""As I've gotten older, I've understood more the importance of friendships"" ""I spell out my words of happiness and congratulations, and sadness,"" Fonda tells CNN."
"Harvard Medical School study shows that women who have close female friendships are less likely to develop impairments as they age. Not having close female friends is detrimental to your health, as much as smoking or being overweight, researchers found. ""You can tell a lot about someone,"" in this case a woman, ""by the company that she keeps"""

"Men tend to want to be alone and not talk about their feelings, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: ""Men are born every bit as relational as women are"" ""They don't ask for help. They don't need it,"" Sutter says."
"Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power, says Jane Fonda. ""We're not better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove,"" she says. ""Sisterhood can be a very powerful force, to give the world what it should be"""
"Women are the fastest growing demographic in the world, especially older women. We are the ones that need to get off the grid. We need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels. There will be more democracy and more jobs and more well-being, and it's women that are going to lead the way."

"""I have my friends, therefore I am,"" says the artist. ""It's a bit of a cliché, but nothing man-made can ever match the imagination of nature"" ""The ocean is the most incredible exhibition space an artist could ever wish for,"" he says."
"The artist submerged the work off the coast of Grenada, in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan. The deepest red I've ever seen in my life lives underwater, he says. The most used, searched and shared image of all his work thus far is this."
"""We all share a fear that we don't protect our oceans enough,"" he says. ""We don't regard our oceans as sacred, and we should,"" he adds. ""Museums are places of preservation, of conservation and of education"""
"CNN's John Defterios has been working on a new series on CNN.com called ""The World's Most Beautiful People"" He says the world's most beautiful people are the people who live at the bottom of the ocean. He says it's hard for people to see how beautiful the ocean is because it's so vast."
"""We want to team up with other inventors, creators, philanthropists, educators, biologists, to see better futures for our oceans,"" he says. ""This is the essential problem: the universe is far, far too interesting to be boring,"" he adds."
"The Large Hadron Collider is the largest scientific device ever built by the human race. The LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a 27-kilometer ring, getting them closer and closer to the speed of light before smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors."
"The Higgs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we're made from. If it wasn't there, those particles would have no mass, and no atoms could form and there would be no us. Theorists have spent decades trying to understand why it has this very peculiarly fine-tuned number."
"In 1998, astronomers made the stunning discovery that the expansion of the universe is speeding up. The universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious repulsive force. If dark energy were anywhere near this strong, then the universe would have been torn apart, stars and galaxies could not form."
"The strength of dark energy requires an even more fantastic level of fine-tuning than we saw for the Higgs field. The hope was that a complete combination of Einstein's general theory of relativity, with quantum mechanics, might provide a solution. It turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all, but a whole collection of theories."
"In most of the multiverse, there is nothing, and we live in one of the few places where the laws of physics allow there to be something. Despite high hopes, the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness populated only by a lonely Higgs boson."
"Harry Cliff is a particle physicist who works at the LHC in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC is a generational project, he says, with people working on it for three decades. China has announced plans to build a supercollider twice the size of the L Collider."
"No one nation can afford to build a machine this large, apart from maybe China, because they can mobilize huge amounts of resources. The next few years may tell us whether we'll be able to continue to increase our understanding of nature. For me it is clear that all societies will be multiethnic, multicultural, multi-religious in the future."
"Bruno Giussani: ""The capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them, is, unfortunately, much worse than what it was 10 years ago"" Bruno: ""There are no clear power relations in the world, no global governance mechanisms that work"""
"During 2015, almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe from many different countries. The war in Syria has been happening for five years. Millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around Syria. Europe looked totally unprepared for the influx of refugees."
"The pressure is at the point of entry, then they come to Germany, Sweden, and Austria. They are the three countries that are, in the end, receiving the refugees. The rest of Europe is looking without doing much. And it's not only about refugees; there are many other areas."
"""This is the moment in which we need more Europe instead of less Europe,"" he says. ""What a European sees is, every single day, a crowd coming, uncontrolled, moving from border to border,"" he adds. ""The idea is that nobody is taking care of it,"" he argues."
"""I'm not asking for the same to happen in Europe, for all European villages to have more refugees,"" he says. ""The trend in the developed world is for these questions to become more and more complex,"" he adds. ""I think we need to make sure that we don't lose any more of the world's population,"" he argues."
"Lebanon and Jordan cannot receive soft loans or grants from the World Bank. This doesn't make any sense, because they are providing a global public good. The long-term ones, in relation to Syrians, is that hope is less and less clear for people."
It's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential. International financial institutions should have flexibility in order to invest more massively in support to these countries. We need to combine all the instruments and to understand that it doesn't make sense anymore to make a distinction between humanitarian aid and development aid.
"The Paris attacks have made the job of the French foreign minister more difficult, says Agnes Poirier. She says the terrorist problem in Europe is largely homegrown, with thousands of European fighters in Syria and Iraq. She believes that the passport that appeared, she believes, was put by the person who blew himself up. Poirieri: ""I think that is part of Daesh's strategy"""
"The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done. Since 1938, the study has tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College. The second group was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods."
The founders of the study would never have imagined that they would still be working today. The men were given medical exams and interviewed in their homes. They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors. Some developed schizophrenia and some died of natural causes.
"Lonely people live shorter lives and are less likely to have a good marriage. Loneliness is linked to poor health and poor physical health. Good relationships are better than bad ones, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."
"The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. Good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. Good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains."
"The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates. Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20."
"Khaled Said was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police in 2011. He created a Facebook page called ""We are all Khaled Said"" The page became the most followed page in the Arab world, with more fans than established media organizations."
"In 2011, a Facebook page I anonymously created helped spark the Egyptian revolution. The invitation reached over a million people, and over 100,000 people confirmed attendance. On January 25th, Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities, calling for change."
"The Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential, but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings. The same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart. The euphoria faded, we failed to build consensus, and the political struggle led to intense polarization."
"In July 2013, the army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president. The polarization reached its peak between the two main powers -- the army supporters and the Islamists. The environment was purely toxic. Both groups wanted you to side with them or against them. In his view, there are five critical challenges facing today's social media."
"Polarization is on the rise in the whole world. We need to work hard on figuring out how technology could be part of the solution, not the problem. We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks to social media, we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else."
"""We need to design social media experiences that promote civility and reward thoughtfulness"" ""I know for a fact if I write a post that is more one-sided, sometimes aggressive, I get to have more people see that post"" ""If I could see how many people are changing their minds, I'd probably write more thoughtfully, rather than appealing to the people who already agree"""

CNN's John Sutter talks about the importance of reading comprehension. Sutter: It's important to be able to focus on what you're reading. He says it's also important to make sure you understand what's being said to you. The key is to make it clear what you are reading.
"Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that. They had weak filters, they had porous filters -- let a lot of external information in. The ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely to have some real creative milestone in their lives."
"The idea of solving a problem by tweaking it is to make it better. In this case, the problem is to find a way to make the problem easier to solve. The solution is to start with the problem and work your way up from there."
"The three friends and the stranger had a 50-50 chance of getting the answer right. The three friends thought they'd done a good job, but the stranger didn't think so. ""These disruptions help us become more creative, but we don't feel that they're helping us,"" says the author."

"Brian Eno: 'We need to run the stupid experiments, we need to deal with the awkward strangers' 'These things help us. They help us solve problems, they help us be more creative. But also ... we really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this'"
"A planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life. One of the closest planets that could support surface water is 23 light years away. Ice absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light, and reflects shorter, bluer light. Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate."
"African-American female astronomer is uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature. Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere. Her organization, Rising Stargirls, teaches astronomy to middle-school girls of color."
"The planet Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. The surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, 500 Celsius. The planet's thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason it can't support life. It's the first time that Amazon is even doing something like this."
"Roy Price and his team record everything. They collect millions of data points to then decide which show they should make. They did that show. It's actually just an average show, actually -- literally, because the average of this curve here is at 7.4."
"Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios. He says data analysis does not work all the time. Price: ""We live in a time where we're turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV"""
"CNN's Jim Boulden says even the most data-savvy companies sometimes get it wrong. He says when a company uses data to make a decision, it can end up making a bad decision. ""It's the same with TV,"" he says. ""You can't predict what's going to be good or bad"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the difference between data and decision-making. He says data can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces. Sutter: There's another tool that can do that, and we all have it, and that tool is the brain."
"Data is a useful tool to make better decisions, but things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions. Data is just a tool, and to keep that in mind, I find this device here quite useful. Before there was data, this was the decision-making device to use."
"Brazil's main reservoir for the city has gone from being completely full in 2010, to being nearly empty today as the city approaches the 2016 Summer Olympics. A similar drama is playing out today in São Paulo, Brazil. Some people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem by taking water from our rural neighbors. But that's an approach that's fraught with legal and social dangers."
"The first source of local water supply that we need to solve our urban water problem will flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities. One of the great tragedies of urban development is that as our cities grew, we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt. The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks and attaching them to the downspouts of our roofs."
The city of Los Angeles is creating a new way to recycle water. The water is captured in a wetland and then pumped back into the ground. The city says it will save millions of dollars by doing this instead of building a new water system.
"In California, we already recycle about 40 billion gallons a year of water through the two-stage advanced process. The water comes into our treatment wetland, it's exposed to sunlight and algae, and those break down the organic chemicals. It then flows down to Anaheim, and becomes the drinking water of the city."
"In California and other modern American cities, about half of our water use happens outdoors. We've seen that it's possible to have our lawns survive and our plants survive with about half as much water. There's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses."
"Cave diver: ""Let's create a water supply that will be able to withstand any of the challenges that climate change throws at us in the coming years"" ""I'm an underwater explorer, more specifically a cave diver. And my voice is the one that's going to teach you about the inside of Mother Earth,"" he says."
"Caves are repositories of amazing life-forms that we never knew existed before. They have no pigment and no eyes in many cases, and these animals are also extremely long-lived. In fact, animals swimming in these caves today are identical in the fossil record."
"Paleoclimatologists are also interested in where the sea level stands at other times on earth. In places like Mexico, in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba, we're looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves. But as it turns out, we know a lot more about space than we do about underground waterways."
"Informational tool allows users to create their own 3D models of the world around them. Informational tools can also be used to help people understand the world in a new way. The technology is being developed by the University of California, San Diego."
"InFORM is an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. The pins of the display represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. You can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well."

A new high-resolution version of TRANSFORM uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch- input device to a phone. TRANSFORM is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays. The system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode.
"We need computers that can physically adapt to us. We need to harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands. I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring our information into the world. Thank you very much."
"The first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter, that was created back in the 1970s. The second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara, who happens to be one of my favorite human poets. We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here."
"According to the logic of the Turing test, can a computer write poetry? Well, yes, absolutely it can. So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1 was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein. And Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP."
"Poem 2 was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson. It looked at the way she used language, learned the model, and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure. But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using."
"The human is not a cold, hard fact. Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time. The computer, more or less, works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it. We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us."
"The computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it. The human is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea and one that changes over time. This is an essentially philosophical idea, and it's one that can't be answered with software alone."
"CNN's John Defterios asks: ""What kind of change are you foreseeing?"" Defterio: ""If we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone, it's going to get worse and worse"" ""We need to change the way we look at the world,"" he says, ""and not just the way it looks at us"""
"Greece has lost one-third of its nominal GDP, says Yanis Varoufakis. ""This is worse than the Great Depression,"" he says. ""If we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's, that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans"""
"In the last three months, in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone, we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods. The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, Japan and in Europe out of work."
"Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor, being in the majority, control government. The working poor acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state. We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy."
"The economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere. The more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth. The question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something closer to a Star Trek-like society."
"Greece's newly elected government is trying to reform the country's economy. Greece's Finance Minister says the country needs a ""Star Trek-like utopia"" to achieve this. He suggests a world where all income stems from capital, and the concept of wage labor becomes obsolete."
"Yanis Varoufakis: If there was any relevance in what I just said, then Marx is relevant. The whole point of reunifying the political and economic is. If we don't do it, then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand."
Greece's Finance Minister Yves Villeprez talks to CNN about his year in office. He says China is creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our addiction to color. He also talks about his experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.
"The ocean is 71 percent of the planet, and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters. In the middle of our corals, is this green fluorescent fish. This molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science."
"The Kaupichphys eel is the first green fluorescent vertebrate ever seen. Scientists are trying to find out how prevalent this phenomenon is. The ocean is a massive filter, and as soon as you start going underwater, you're going to lose your colors, and it's going to get dark."
"In total -- we just reported this last year -- we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish. The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral. The males give birth, just phenomenal creatures."
"The first biofluorescent swellshark was found in a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California. ""They're showing these distinct patterns, and there are areas that are fluorescent and Areas that are not fluorescent"" The swellsharks have twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of them."
"The first biofluorescent sea turtle was found in the Solomon Islands. The shark sees in the blue-green interface, about 100 times better than we can see in the dark. There are only a few thousand breeding females of the hawksbill turtle left."

"The court's decision ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the U.S. It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation. It helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need."
"Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims, but the most controversial are to so-called ""isolated DNA"" Patent holder has right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing. Allowing patent holders, often private companies, to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients."
"The Supreme Court has made clear that certain things are not patent eligible. DNA, the most fundamental structure of life, codes for the production of all of our proteins. DNA is both a product of nature and a law of nature, regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in a test tube."
Patent office had issued thousands of patents on human genes for more than 20 years. Legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress. Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States.
"Kathleen Maxian's sister developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad. The test was negative. That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family. Two years later, Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result."
"Myriad says isolated BRCA genes were products of nature. Case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet. In March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion -- 152 pages -- and a complete victory for Myriad. ""We could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case,"" plaintiff says."
"Myriad appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The US government submitted a brief on Myriad's side in the district court. The two judges who ruled against Myriad did so for completely different reasons. The court has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent."
"The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives, and it agreed to hear ours. ""I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago,"" Judge Bryson says."
"The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 in favor of Myriad's DNA test for BRCA genes. The decision sparked a wave of interest in testing for the gene, which is linked to breast and ovarian cancer. ""I started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely"""
"Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. It's us parents who feel like science is this esoteric, weird discipline. We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work."
"Computer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them very, very foreign to us. We don't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces. Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer."
"In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play. She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids. She taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems."
"""I tell the kids, ""Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer."" And again, the kids go, ""Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this.""

"Bye Bye Plastic Bags is a group of children from all over the island of Vanuatu. The children were inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places. The group uses a multi-layered approach, based on an on- and off-line signature petition."
Village is already two-thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free. First attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed. The village mayor was our first friend and he loved our T-shirts. The Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year.
Interactors are the youngest department of Rotary International. They are inspired by Jane Goodall and Ban Ki Moon. They have learned about the importance of commitment and patience. They also learned how to deal with frustrations and how to build relationships.
Isabel and IW went on a hunger strike to raise awareness about plastic bags. The girls wanted to get Bali's governor to meet with them to talk about how to stop plastic bags on the island. Police were called to their home and school on day two of the hunger strike.
"Bali's mayor has pledged to make the island plastic bag free by 2018. ""We remind him and his team of the promises he has made,"" says IW. IW: Stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message."
"Bali's Green School is built out of bamboo and teaches children to be leaders of today. The school has been working for three years to say no to plastic bags on the island. ""We still have a lot of work to do, but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports is ""Do you have nay plastic bags to declare?"""
"Pleurobot is a robot designed to closely mimic a salamander species called Pleurodeles waltl. The robot can walk, and as you'll see later, it can also swim. Biorobotics is a field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals."
"Pleurobot is a robot that simulates the movement of a salamander. The amphibian is a key animal from an evolutionary point of view. It makes a wonderful link between swimming, as you find it in eels or fish, and quadruped locomotion."
"The robot is able to switch between walking, trotting and flapping its wings. It was created by a team of researchers at the University of Jena in Germany. The robot is now being used to train other robots to do the same."
The robot can mimic the movements of a real-life salamander. It can also be used to swim in the water. The robot is controlled by a computer program on the inside of the robot. It is not yet clear if the robot will be used in the real world.
"Cheetah-Cub can control speed, heading and type of gait by stimulating the spinal cord. The robot can also do turning by stimulating more one side of the cord than the other. Scientists studied cat biomechanics to see how much the morphology helps locomotion."
"The Cheetah-Cub robot is a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat. The robot is very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break."
"The spinal cord is the key controller for locomotion in humans. If it is damaged, a person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic. This is why it is important to understand how the spinal cord works. It is also important to know how it communicates with the rest of the body."
"In the spinal cord you find reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop. The ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time. In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year."
"CNN's John Defterios speaks to a group of young people about the future of the world. He says they are concerned about the impact of economic growth on the environment. Defterio: ""We're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance"""
" capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer, he says. But in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum, he adds. U.S. should focus on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States, he argues."
"Dambisa: In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth, we're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work. ""We have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth,"" says Dambisa."

"Andrés Navarrette traveled to the Amazon to see the legendary ""warm stream of the Amazon"" The river is protected by a powerful shaman and can only be swum in after heavy rain. The average temperatures in the river are 86 degrees C. The river flows hot and fast."
"The water is clean and had a pleasant taste, which is a little weird for geothermal systems. The locals had always known about this place, and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it. They would go into towns and ask the Inca, ""Where's another civilization we can conquer?"""
"The Inca, out of vengeance, told them, ""Go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there"" The indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka, ""boiled with the heat of the sun"" It actually took me three years to get that footage."
"The river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path. The Spanish set off into the jungle, but the few that return come back with stories of powerful shamans. There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage, and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall."
"The boiling river exists independent of volcanism, according to scientists. Animals fall in and lose power, losing power, until they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out. They're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot."
"The boiling river is over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center. The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes. Researchers genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river. They have found new lifeforms, unique species living in the boiling river."
"The Peruvian government says the land is just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development. ""We live in an incredible world. We live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle, where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life"""
The first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone was reported on May 23. The virus has since spread to other parts of the country. The U.S. government has sent a team to Sierra Leone to help with the outbreak. The team is working with the local government to find a way to stop the spread.
"The genome of a virus is the blueprint. It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information. We could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating. The diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequence."
"The Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola. It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal. The problem is that the data that all of us are using, Googling on the web is just too limited to do what we need to do."
"Many health-care workers died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and separately. Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours. We're all in this fight together. We all have to demand that of ourselves and others."
"This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia. The next time this happens, it could happen in a city of millions. This experience shows us, that we have the technology to win this thing. But we can only do it if we do it together."
"Matthew Williams was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in LA. He says Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes and the perceptions of everyone watching. ""This movement has changed my life and those of so many others"""
"Special Olympics gives people with intellectual disabilities the chance to be part of a team and compete in sports. It also gives them a chance to improve their physical and mental health. The U.S. has the largest number of Special Olympics athletes in the world, with more than 100,000 members."
"Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport. The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening. They were more excited, happy and confident, because their coach could vocally communicate with them."
"The world does not see all people with disabilities as champions. The next time you see someone with a disability, tell them how much it hurts. The world is a better place because of the Special Olympics, says Jackie. ""I am no longer hidden, I am a champion,"" he says."
Global marine life has been slashed in half in the last 40 years. Over 90 percent of our largest predatory species have disappeared since the 1950s. Over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day. We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have.
"The World Health Organization recently reported that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage. The solution lies in aquaculture -- the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans. As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said, ""We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters"""
"Fish is the last food that we hunt. Scientists have a lot of theories about why this is, but almost all of them involve nutrition. Fish is healthy, it prevents heart disease, it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega-3s. There's 500 species of fish being farmed currently."
"In the last 50 years, global meat consumption has more than quadrupled. In the next 35 years, we are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand. Every single fishing vessel combined, small and large, produces about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood."
"A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost 8,000 liters of water to create just one pound of meat. Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet. And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it."
"Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind, aside from insects. Sixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed. By 2050, we are going to need at least 70 percent more protein than what is available today."
"Fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind. But it's had a really bad reputation. New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural. Microbes, for example, can be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal -- at scale."
"The UN predicts the world's population will reach 11 billion by the end of the century. Insects are the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste. Microbes and insects are actually net water producers. This revolution is starting as we speak, it just needs scale."
"We need to have a meal that we can trust, live long lives. Even in the poorest countries, it's not just about money. The day will come where people will realize -- no, demand -- farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well."
"LZ Granderson says the use of race in medicine is a problem. He says it's a social construct, not a medical one. Granderson: We need to stop using race as a barometer of health and well-being. We need more information about the source of our food, he says."
"Doctors use race as a convenient proxy for more important factors, like muscle mass, enzyme level. Doctors routinely interpret GFR, this important indicator of kidney function, by race. The exact same creatinine level automatically produces a different GFR estimate depending on whether or not the patient is African-American."
Race can't substitute for clinical measures without sacrificing patient well-being. Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes. Black and Latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites. The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine.
"Dr. Samuel Cartwright argued in the 1850s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons. Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs. Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people."
Roxanne Jones: It's time to stop using race as a way to solve social problems. She says the real problem is that we don't know how to solve it. Jones: We need to find out how to use race to improve the lives of others.
" Neurosurgeon: ""With a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself"" ""We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue"" ""It's not an easy task. Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family"""
"The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain. Regular stem cells are very active cells. These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells. All of you have them in your brain."
The cells represent four percent of your cortical brain cells. They have a very important role during the development stage. We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions. We call these autologous grafts -- autografts.
"In the first-case scenario, we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken from the brain, they go back home, the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear. In the second case, we performed the lesion, and in this case, the cells remained and they became mature neurons."
"""We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models, like Parkinson's"" ""It takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it"" ""I hope that one day we'll be able to use them in humans"" ""We're not there yet"""
"Jocelyne Bremner is a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through surgical strategies. She says it takes a long time to select the patients, do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment. BremNER: Imagine worldwide how a trove of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past."
"The book was written in the 13th century, but was lost during the Second World War. It is the only surviving copy of a book of the same name. The book is called ""The Art of Reading"" and is written in Latin. It was written by a group of men who wanted to learn more about the art of reading."
"The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin. Using infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners of the Dead Sea Scrolls. This is the closest we can come to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom under Emperor Constantine."
"The Lazarus Project is a not-for-profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions. The technology is expensive and very rare, and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric. Over the past five years, our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries."
"Multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object's creation. Through this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind, the naïvetés. Textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar with new techniques."
"Mali's high humidity is putting manuscripts that could change the history of world culture in jeopardy. The manuscripts are hidden in Bamako, the capital of Mali, moldering in the high humidity. What was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy, this time by climate."

"CNN's John Sutter has been photographing the world's oceans for more than a decade. Sutter: ""I've visited hundreds of marine locations, but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply"" ""You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists,"" Sutter says."
"Every June and July, huge numbers of sardines travel north to the Maldives. In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators. They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface, then they rush in to dine."
Manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of 8 million dollars every single year. Fishermen once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins. The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
"The San Ignacio Lagoon is a critical calving ground for gray whales. Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse. Local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve. In 2005, after only a single decade of protection, scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded."
Photographer Paul Barnwell has been documenting the world's oceans for 40 years. Barnwell says he wants to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 7.3 billion people. He says he always operates on the assumption that the next great picture is right around the corner.

"Data science is the only way to understand interactions between drugs and glucose, says Dr. Richard Schafer. Schafer: ""I'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion, the only hope is to leverage lots of data"""
"Russian-born Dr. Russ Borsuk says he was impressed by a student's work on a pillbox. But he says it's not publishable because it doesn't have ""standard-of-proof evidence"" He says the student found two drugs that had similar glucose-changing signals. The drugs are Paxil and pravastatin."
"Stanford researchers found 10 patients on two drugs who had problems with their glucose. Eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose when they got the second P. glucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter. If it gets up to 120, 125, your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes."
"Researchers found that patients getting two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly. When we looked at the glucose of diabetics, it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20. This was a big deal, and we said ""We've got to publish this"""
"CNN's Jim Boulden asked Google to search for side effects of drugs. He says the results showed that when the drugs were given to mice, their glucose levels went up. Bouldens: ""It's kind of a bummer that we can't use that information"""
"Researchers looked at what people search for when they have hyperglycemia. They found that if they search for ""paroxetine"" or ""pravastatin,"" the rate goes up. They also found that when they searched for ""urinating a lot,"" the rates went up."
The FDA is using social media to look for side effects of drugs. The aim is to find out if a drug is more effective or less effective when taken with another drug. The data will be used to create a more accurate picture of drug interactions.
"The two drugs actually caused problems. They could throw somebody into diabetes who would otherwise not be in diabetes. We could have found new effects of drugs that neither of them has alone, but together, instead of causing a side effect, could be a new and novel treatment for diseases that don't have treatments."

"LIGO: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. 1.3 billion years ago, in a distant, distant galaxy, two black holes locked into a spiral, falling inexorably towards each other. The gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth."
"LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves in 1973. He said, ""The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous"" Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than an eye."
"We use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds. For example, listening to gravity, just in this way, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes. If we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound, we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us."
LIGO is an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we've never had before. It's a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible. There's a lot out there that we can't see -- in practice or even in principle.
"LIGO is a group of scientists who are trying to understand the origin of the universe. They hope to find out more about how the universe came to be. LIGO has become a multimillion-dollar industry, but it's just the beginning."

"By 2007, there was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States. In China by 2011, there were more car sales happening in China than in the US. Up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel."
 uberPOOL is a new way to get around the city of San Francisco. The app allows people to take two rides at the same time. The company says it has taken 7.9 million miles off the roads. It has also taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air.
"Uber CEO says the company has added 100,000 new people carpooling every week. In China, the company is doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month, 500,000 per day. Uber has a new app called uberCOMMUTE that matches people up with neighbors."

"The only thing more personal than your phone is your home. People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet. Most of us feel really responsible. That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home. And it's because of this that our company can even exist."
"A well-designed reputation system is key for building trust. The right design can help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases. The more different somebody is, the less we trust them. The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us."
"Building trust takes the right amount of disclosure, the company says. If you share too little, like, ""Yo,"" acceptance rates go down. But there's a zone that's just right, like ""Love the artwork in your place"" We use the size of the box to suggest the right length."
"Out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic. Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes. We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay who suffered a heart attack. They donated their own blood for his operation."

They are a humanitarian responsibility, but they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions,"" she says."
"The modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the Second World War. In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration, or return to the country they've come from. But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo."
"In practice, countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees. ""The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong. It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world,"" he says. ""There are just so many contradictions in the system,"" he adds."
"Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys. For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today. But I think we can reconsider that choice. Amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey."
"Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue, that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens. We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society. But they don't have to. They can contribute."
"Refugees need opportunities to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking. We need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing. We lament the existence of human smugglers, and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe. Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees."
"Germany is considering allowing Syrian refugees to choose where they want to live. The idea was proposed at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago. A pilot program will begin in the summer, says German Foreign Minister Angela Merkel. Germany's liberal values are in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, she says."
"Humanitarian visas could be used to allow refugees to claim asylum in Europe. The idea has already been adopted in Brazil, where over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas, enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil."

"Natalia Rybczynski is a paleobiologist who specializes in digging up really old dead stuff. She discovered a tibia, a leg bone, that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal. Collagen is what gives structure to our bones, and usually, after so many years, it breaks down."
"The bone belonged to a 3.5 million-year-old camel. The bone was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels. The camel would have been about nine feet tall, weighed around a ton. It was found in the remote Canadian tundra."
"Scientists have known for a long time, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels are originally American. The really primitive, early ones would have been really small, almost like rabbits. One branch of camels went down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas."
"The Sahara was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now. It would have had six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over. What if those broad feet were meant to tromp over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?"

Only six percent of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison. 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders. This means there's practically no deterrent to assault in the United States. We started by talking to college survivors. And what they wish they'd had in college is pretty simple.
"Sexual assault victims want the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant. We created a website that actually does this and we launched it in August, on two college campuses. The application that we built is for college campuses, but the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace."
One in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted during their college career. Less than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school or to the police. Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own.

"The author was born in South Africa and raised in the U.S. She moved back to South Africa when she was 14. She says she is still trying to understand her heritage and her place in the world. ""I feel like I'm in a strange place right now,"" she says. ""It's very strange."""
"The year was 2011 and all over southern Africa and the whole continent, affordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing became much easier to get. So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana and you wanted to have fun on the Internet, you had to tweet in English."
CNN's John Defterios writes about the role of African nations in the world. He says the continent is at the center of the world's problems. He asks: Why aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes and failures of other countries?
"""I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes is to foster something I like to call social Pan-Africanism"" ""My dream is that young Africans stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation"" ""In Africa, we say, ""If you want to go fast, you go alone, but if you wants to go far, you going together"" ""I believe that social Pan - Africanism is how we can go far together"""
"The hashtag #ifafricawasabar garnered around 60,000 tweets, lit up the continent and made its way to publications all over the world. For the first time ever, African pain and African aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most: other Africans."

"Cancer affects all of us -- especially the highly invasive and drug-resistant ones. The key is a set of molecules known as siRNA. Each siRNA molecule can turn off a specific gene inside the cell. But if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our bloodstream, it degrades."
"The nanoparticle has to be about one one-hundredth the size of a human hair. It has to get through the bloodstream, penetrate the tumor tissue and be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell. Engineering at the molecular level can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer."
"The siRNA is deployed first. It acts for hours, giving enough time to silence and block those survival genes. Then, the chemotherapy drug comes out of the core and destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently. With sufficient gene blockers, we can address many different kinds of mutations."
"Nanostructure particles have been tested in a highly aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer. The tumors stopped growing, decreased in size and were eliminated in some cases. What's great about this approach is that it can be personalized."

"It's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their interest in returning to work. Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds: veterans, military spouses, retirees and repatriating expats. For those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons, we have fewer or no maternity leaves."
Employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete. Relaunchers need to come to the table with a working knowledge of office management software. It's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value.
"In 2010, I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity as a way for professionals to return to work. Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee started corporate reentry internship programs. These internships are paid, and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries.

"Tracy Shapiro was a relauncher when she decided to return to work. She got a temp job in a finance department, but the company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more. She ended up blowing away all of their expectations, and the company made her a permanent offer."
"Successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field. Don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program. Be their first success story, and you can be the example for more relauncher to come."
"Norwegian author says exploration and exploitation is about coming up with what's new. He says exploration is risky, but exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good, better products. ""It's about making our trains run on time,"" he says."

""The real, real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities: exploration and exploitation,"" he adds. ""Doing both well as the. same time is art -- pushing both exploration and. exploitation"""
"There are so many traps that keep us where we are, he says. We discover something, but we don't have the patience or persistence to get at it and make it work. Another trap is the success trap. Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing."
"Firm's CEO: ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail"" ""We are like that, too. When we know something well, it's difficult to change,"" he says. ""I see other companies that say, ""I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes"""

"The beauty of exploration is in the balance, says the CEO of French biotech company Facit. Facit went from maximum revenue to zero in just six months. The company's engineers bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan to double-check their calculators. But exploration can go wild, too, says CEO."
How would we survive on a planet like Mars? How would we ship supplies from Earth? How do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us? Will we be able to survive in space? How will we find our way back to Earth?
"The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months. Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism, microscopic or not. synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food, our fuel and our environment."
"GMOs can be used to make plants that can survive in harsh conditions. They can also be used for medicine and fuel, as well as food and water. The technology could be used on Mars, but it would require huge amounts of new land."
"Deinococcus radiodurans is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid, and, most notably, radiation. While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known, we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals. Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can harness the bacterium's ability to thrive under otherwise lethal doses of radiation."
"Humanity has the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny. The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life. Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving. Our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question who we are."
"CNN's John Defterios is a self-confessed procrastinator. He started playing Nintendo games at 5am and would not stop until he had mastered them. This served him well in college, because he finished his senior thesis four months before the deadline. He was proud of that, until a few years ago."
People who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. The people who race in are in such a frenzy that they don't have original thoughts either. Maybe original people just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity.
"Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps. The moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups. As Aaron Sorkin put it, ""You call it procrastinating. I call it thinking"""
"The night before the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, Martin Luther King, Jr. was up past 3am rewriting his speech. By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas."
"First movers had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent for the improvers. Facebook waited to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. It's much easier to improve on somebody else's idea than to create something new from scratch."
Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users. The four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge. The key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four.
"If you use Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option that was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default and ask, is there a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful."
"Elon Musk: Most people don't try new things because they're afraid they'll fail. He says the best ideas come from people who try them and fail. Musk: ""We're not going to get judged on the things we don't do"""
"Bach, Beethoven, Mozart had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces. Originals are not that different from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt. They procrastinate. They have bad ideas."
"CNN's John Defterios writes that the best way to make a difference in the world is to make it your own. He says we need to be willing to try new things, even if they don't work out. Defterio: ""We need to make the world a better place for all of us"""
"Mars is less than half the size of the Earth, but the surface area that you can stand on is equivalent to the surface of Earth. The atmosphere on Mars is really thin -- 100 times thinner than on Earth -- and it's not breathable. The average temperature is minus 81 degrees, although there is quite a range of temperature."
"Humans could reach Mars in 240 days, if they launch on a specific day. The biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough to get there. Only about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful. Some think if we got there by 2050, that'd be a pretty good achievement."

"NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars. Water is the basis of all life as we know it, and it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars. The soil alone on Mars contains up to 60 percent water."
"Orbiters tell us that there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars as well as glaciers. If only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted, most of the planet would be under 30 feet of water. Moxie is a reverse fuel cell that sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen."
"The next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in 2020 will be able to produce enough oxygen to keep one person alive indefinitely. The soil on Mars, by and large, is perfect for making bricks. Most of our food will arrive from Earth, and it will be dried."
"On Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure. Dava Newman, a scientist at MIT, has created a sleek space suit. It will keep us together, block radiation and keep us warm. Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ... we can do this."
"It won't take long for the temperature on Mars to start rising, probably less than 20 years. Eventually, Mars will be made to feel like British Columbia. We'll still be left with the complicated problem of making the atmosphere breathable. But humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable."
"We could do a lot of good with the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars. There will be software companies, there will be hotels and bars. The rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should. This means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare, education, roads."
"CNN's John Defterios looks at how offshore tax havens work. He says it can be hard for people to understand what's going on. Defterio: ""It has allowed employees of school districts to rip off the public"" He says there are fewer cases in the U.S. than in other countries."
"An undercover investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States. All but one of those lawyers provided suggestions on how to move those suspect funds. This is about how a system works, that entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability. We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder."
The release of papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world. The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned. There's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
"""Where were The New Yorker's fabled copy editors?"" a reader wrote. ""There's no excuse for this mistake,"" says a copy editor. ""No-nothingism"" might be American vernacular for ""nihilism,"" he says."
"The editor never sells out the writer, never goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut. A great editor saves a writer from her excesses. Copy editors, too, have a code; we don't advertise our oversights. ""Sandy"" sometimes writes a sentence that gives a copy editor pause."

"In India, only 12 percent of girls and women have access to hygienic ways of managing their periods. Menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor for reproductive tract infections. Even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful in Garhwa, Jharkhand."
"The author's period brought in the social restrictions that are imposed upon our girls and women when they're on their periods. The author was not allowed to touch or eat pickles. She had to wash her bed sheet after every period, even if it was not stained."
"About 85 percent of girls and women in India would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month. They're not allowed to take baths during periods, and in some households they are even secluded from other family members. Can you imagine what this does to the self-esteem and self-confidence of a young girl? The psychological trauma that this inflicts."
"Researchers found that many parents and teachers wanted to educate girls about periods before they have started getting their menstrual cycle. Since it is a taboo, they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it. Girls nowadays get their periods in classes 6 and 7, but our educational curriculum teaches them about periods only in standard 8 and 9."
"""Menstrupedia Comic"" aims to educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way. The cartoon characters represent girls in their different phases of puberty. Parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book, and sometimes even boys were interested."
"15 schools in different parts of India have made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about menstruation. So far, more than 4,000 girls have been educated by using the book in India. Research shows that three out of every 10 girls are not aware of menstruation at the time of their first periods."
"The library of Earth is an old one. Most pages are destroyed soon after being written. Some pages are overwritten, creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests of long-gone landscapes. Unlike the Moon -- our dead, rocky companion -- the Earth is alive."
"The Earth's volumes remained inscrutable to humans until recently. The answer relies on a formula that all paleontologists use. If you want to find dinosaurs like I do, find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there. You can only make a fossil in a sedimentary rock, a rock made by sand and mud."
"Every pebble that you see on the ground there is a piece of dinosaur bone. When you go to a place that's relatively unexplored, you have a much better chance of finding something that's new to science. The question is: Will you find something that is scientifically significant?"
"Dreadnoughtus schrani was 85 feet from snout to tail. It stood two-and-a-half stories at the shoulder, and weighed 65 tons. That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex. The bison in Yellowstone injure far more people than do the grizzly bears."
"Dreadnoughtus was a model of efficiency. It could clear out a huge envelope of vegetation, taking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few. It evolved a bulldog-like wide-gait stance, giving them immense stability. The penalty for falling over is death."
"An asteroid hits the Earth and wipes out the dinosaurs. The continents drifted. The mammals rose. And then, in East Africa, an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought. With seven billion peripatetic Homo sapiens on the planet, it was perhaps inevitable that one of them would eventually trod on the grave of the magnificent titan."
The dinosaurs were wiped out between 235 and 66 million years ago. The bones of Dreadnoughtus lay underground for 77 million years. The tiniest perturbation of that asteroid far from Earth would have caused it to miss our planet by a wide margin.
"Dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction, snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own. The nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting. Why study the ancient past? Because it gives us perspective and humility."
"2.5 billion people around the world don't have a credit score. That's a third of the world's population. There are currently over one billion smartphones in emerging markets. Over time, this data is getting captured on our phones, and it provides a rich picture of a person's life."
"Small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya, can't walk into a bank and ask for a business loan. Loan sharks are always an option, but with interest rates that are well above 300 percent, they're financially risky. But one day, Jenipher's son convinced her to download our application and apply for a loan."
Jenipher had a low savings balance and no previous loan history. The data shows a four percent increase in repayment among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts. People who communicate with more than 58 different contacts tend to be more likely to be good borrowers.
"People in emerging markets that may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface are actually willing and have the capacity to repay. Our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya in just the past year. With something as simple as a credit score, we're giving people the power to build their own futures."

"If you imagine dark colors to light colors are more use of the word, you can see that Appalachia is a pretty lonely place. If you've ever dated anyone from Seattle, this makes perfect sense. You can replace the name of every city in the United States with the word people use more in that city than anywhere else."

"The number of atoms, the file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby, will actually fill an entire Titanic of thumb drives -- multiplied 2,000 times. This is the biggest amount of information that exists. But nature, fortunately, is much smarter than a young man, and in four billion years, managed to pack this information in a small crystal."
"It took more than 40 years to finally poke inside a human cell, take out this crystal, unroll it, and read it for the first time. The code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet, four letters: A, T, C and G. To build a human, you need three billion of them."

"Thomas was born without the top part of his skull. He died in his mother's arms after a six-day battle with a rare brain condition. His parents decided to donate his organs, including his liver and corneas, to other hospitals. They are still waiting for the results."
"CNN.com spoke with the family of a boy who died of a rare form of retinoblastoma, a cancer of the retina. The boy's parents donated their son's organs for transplant, but were told they could only donate for transplants. Thomas' parents decided to donate his organs to the Old Dominion Eye Foundation, which arranged the donation. The eye bank arranged for Thomas' family to visit their lab."
Thomas had a fatal birth defect called anencephaly. His brain was not formed correctly because part of his skull was missing. Doctors are using Thomas's retina and his RNA to try to inactivate the gene that causes tumor formation. Thomas was the 360th specimen over the course of about 10 years.

Lying is a typical part of development for children. Some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age. Good lying requires two key ingredients: theory of mind and self-control. Lying is the basis of lying because I know you don't know what I know.
"Children who have more advanced mind-reading and self-control abilities tell lies earlier and are more sophisticated liars, researchers say. Deficits in these abilities are associated with serious developmental problems, such as ADHD and autism. ""If you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie, instead of being alarmed, you should celebrate"""
"Kang Lee: If you guess randomly, there's a 50 percent chance you're going to get it right. If your accuracy is around 50 percent, it means you are a terrible detector of children's lies. Kang Lee: Let's start with undergrads and law school students, who typically have limited experience with children."
"Social workers and child-protection lawyers can't detect children's lies. Judges, customs officers and police officers, who deal with liars on a daily basis, can't. Their performance is around chance. What about parents? Can parents detect other children's lying? No, they cannot."
"Under our facial skin, there's a rich network of blood vessels. When we experience different emotions, our facial blood flow changes subtly. These changes are regulated by the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control. By looking at facial blood. flow changes, we can reveal people's hidden emotions."
"Technology can reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying. It can do so noninvasively, remotely, inexpensively, with an accuracy at about 85 percent. The technology can be used in education, health care, and other fields, the researchers say."
"Transdermal optical imaging technology is at a very early stage of development. It could be used to detect politicians' heart rate, mood and stress. The technology could also be used in dating to determine whether a woman likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you."

"The equipment you need can be built from garbage, and the key processing step only requires soap and water. There's even a freaking laser, so you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot. If we can use asparagus to form new connections between the ends of damaged and severed nerves, maybe even a spinal cord."

"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most painful tumor types. The hard-to-reach location prevents the doctor from surgically removing it. chemotherapy is the only option for the pancreatic cancer patient. The drugs will reach healthy organs, resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall."
"The drug is embedded into devices that look like this one. They are flexible enough that they can be folded to fit into the catheter, so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery. They will actually physically prevent the tumor from entering other organs, controlling the metastasis."
"Pancreatic cancer is the third cause of cancer deaths. Only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years. By rethinking the way we deliver the drug, we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions for almost all other impossible problems in pancreatic cancer patients."
"About 20 percent of people wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD. The most vulnerable are people who were abused as children, who suffered trauma as children. If you served in Vietnam and your brother is schizophrenic, you're more likely to get PTSD from Vietnam."
"Iraq and Afghanistan have produced, thank God, a casualty rate about one third of what it was in Vietnam. As a result, the casualty rates have gone down. But they've also produced three times the disability rates. Around half of our military has filed for some kind of PTSD compensation from the government."
"Vets are slightly less likely to commit suicide later if they deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan, a study found. But if you come back to an alienating, modern society, you might remain traumatized your entire life. Modern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide and depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse ever in human history."
Around 50 percent of veterans have filed for PTSD compensation. The highest rates of depression were urban women in North America. The wealthiest group in the U.S. was also the wealthiest group. The military is trying to find out what is causing these problems.
"The Israeli military has a PTSD rate of around one percent. When soldiers come back from the front line, they're not going from a military environment to a civilian environment. They're coming back to a community where everyone understands about the military. It's as if they're all in one big tribe."
"After 9/11, the murder rate in New York City went down by 40 percent. Even combat veterans of previous wars who suffered from PTSD said that their symptoms went down. The reason is that if you traumatize an entire society, we don't fall apart and turn on one another."
"The gap between rich and poor is the biggest it's ever been. Veterans have gone away and are coming back and seeing their own country with fresh eyes. It's time for this country to unite, if only to help the men and women who fought to protect us."

Perry: ""I put the letter on my kitchen table, I poured myself a giant glass of vodka with ice and lime"" Perry: The theory that introspection built up in human history only about 3,000 years ago can be examined in an objective manner."
"The word introspection does not appear a single time in the books we want to analyze. The distance between any two words is indicative of how closely related they are. Words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods. The words ""grapefruit"" and ""logarithm"" are very far away from each other."
"The word astronomy is exactly where it should be, between what it is, and what it describes. The algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions, of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection. So for instance, words such as ""self,"" ""guilt,"" ""reason,"" ""emotion,"" are very close to ""introspection,"" but other words, suchas ""red,"" ""football,"" ""candle,"" are just far away."
"In the same way that we can monitor our own health, we can study our own minds. In a new experiment, scientists recorded the speech of 34 people at high risk of developing schizophrenia. The results of the experiment can be used to predict the development of mental illness."
"In the '70s, Julian Jaynes claimed that only 3,000 years ago, humans were what today we would call schizophrenics. Gracias: There was just not enough information in semantics to predict the future organization of the mind. Gracia: We're getting close to understanding how we can convert this intuition that we all have into an algorithm."

"In August of 2012, I led my first expedition, taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland. The sheer size of the icebergs is humbling. The locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice that are no longer freezing over as they once did."
Greenland's melting glaciers are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels. Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers as early as 2020. Sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet by century's end. The Maldives is the lowest and flattest country in the entire world.
"After the 11th, and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty, and just being pissed off in general -- at myself, my parents, the government; not having confidence, not having a respectable job, my shitty mini-fridge that I just drove to California and back -- I joined the Marine Corps and loved it. It's one of the things I'm most proud of having done in my life."
CNN's John Sutter talks about his time in the Marine Corps. Sutter was injured while on duty in Iraq and had to leave the military. He decided to go back to school and become an actor. He says he was surprised by how difficult it was to transition from military to civilian life.
"In the military, everything has meaning. Everything you do is either steeped in tradition or has a practical purpose. You can't smoke in the field because you don't want to give away your position. You don't touch your face -- you have to maintain a personal level of health and hygiene."

"""We have no idea"" why babies are dying, says Dr. Frank. ""I want to fix it,"" he says. ""That's why I'm trying to do what I'm doing. I want to make a difference"" He says he's taking a new approach to the problem of babies dying."
"At the time, in those front lines in the war on cancer, we had few tools. And the tools we did have couldn't differentiate between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard and those healthy cells. It's a drug called Herceptin that allowed us to precisely target HER2-positive breast cancer."
"AIDS was a death sentence for doctors in San Francisco in the '80s. Now, things are better, but HIV/AIDS remains a terrible global challenge. antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee that a woman will not transmit the virus to her baby."
"In sub-Saharan Africa we can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest. This precision approach has cut by nearly half HIV transmission from mothers to baby in the last five years. We know who to target, what to target and how to target."
"In Africa, babies are dying because of a bacterial infection transferred from the mother to the baby. Once we define the problem, we can prevent that death with something as cheap and safe as penicillin. With this approach, and with these interventions and others like them, I have no doubt that a precision public health approach can help our world achieve our 15-year goal."
"The promise of precision public health is to bring these two worlds together, he says. Every day in the rich world, we're bringing incredible talent and tools to precisely target diseases, he adds.

"There are at least 800 million small arms and light weapons in circulation in the world today. In some parts of the world, you can buy an AK-47 for as little as 10 dollars. In many places in which I have worked, it is easier to get access to an automatic rifle than to clean drinking water."
"CNN's John Defterios goes to war in Afghanistan. He finds that 80 percent of the world's small arms come from the U.N. He also finds that most of the people who are dying in war are living in rich countries. Defterio: ""It's shocking, isn't it?"""
Spending on war per person per year now amounts to about 249 dollars -- 249 dollars per person. That is roughly 12 times what we spend on foreign aid. The curbing of small arms is not going to solve the problem of war. But we can shift that balance.

"LIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet. Photography can be described as the recording of a single moment frozen within a fraction of time. Most of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker or a crane."

"""Day to Night"" is a series of photographs of the U.S. National Park Service. The series is inspired by the work of the late artist George Bierstadt. ""It's about landscape, it's about color, and it's also about history,"" photographer says."
"Photographer and his wife had to tape their feet into position every time he clicked the shutter on this image. The two most important things are patience and the power of observation, he says. ""Time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around,"" he says of his work."
"Photographer captures the moment people share their experiences of the world around them. ""The act of sharing has suddenly become more important than the experience itself,"" he says. ""It's a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is and what it is evolving into"""
"Day to Night is a new way of seeing, compressing time, exploring the space-time continuum within a photograph. Photographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours and shooting over 1,500 images, I then choose the best moments of the day and night."
"The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve, or the Law of Errors, is one of the most important curves ever. The curve tells about the statistics of velocities of particles in the same way as a demographic curve would tell about ages of individuals."

"In 1673, Jean Richer noticed that a pendulum swings slightly slower in Cayenne than in Paris. From this observation alone, and clever mathematics, Newton deduced that the Earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles.

Poverty is a problem like any other. Global poverty has powerful levers. Let's engage our collective passion for problem-solving and figure out what those levers are. Most of the world's poor are farmers. More than half engage in farming as a major source of income.
"When farmers become more productive, they earn more income, they climb out of poverty, they feed their communities and they reduce environmental pressure. Most of the farmers I know are actually women. If we're going to put the future of humanity in one person's hands, then I'm really glad it's her."
"Many smallholder farmers lack access to basic tools and knowledge. These are tools and techniques that date to the Bronze Age, and it's why many farmers are still very poor. But as a field practitioner, I believe these are actually very solvable problems if we just take the right strategies."
Ending poverty is simply a matter of delivering proven goods and services to people. We don't need more genius types right now. We just haven't delivered these things to everybody just yet. The humble delivery guy is going to end global poverty in our lifetime.
"The program provides practical, hands-on training to farmers in the field every two weeks. It's kind of like Amazon for rural farmers. Farmers pay us little by little over time, covering most of our expenses. There are many companies, governments and nonprofits that have delivery armies."
"Humanity has already invented effective tools to end poverty. We just need to deliver them. This talk is all about those levers, and why they make poverty a winnable fight in our lifetimes. In every field of human development, super-smart people have invented inexpensive, highly effective tools."
"For the first time in human history, we have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us. The world's companies, governments and non-profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this relatively small area. If we are willing, every one of us has a role to play."
"""We are an exceptional people. We've run marathons at a five-minute mile pace"" ""If we have the will, every one of us has a role to play"" ""It's incredibly possible to end extreme poverty. We just need to deliver proven goods and services"""
"40 million Americans are indebted for their passage to the new economy. Even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013. The worst of times can be the best of times, because certain truths flash up in ways that you can't ignore."
"The U.S. owes more than $1.2 billion in student loans. The loans are used to pay for education and other services. The debt is a form of student loan debt. It is a way of paying for education, not a way to pay."
"College is the new high school, we already say, but why stop there? People can be upsold on certifications and recertifications, master's degrees, doctoral degrees. Buy a degree, much like you do a Lexus of a Louis Vuitton bag, to distinguish yourself from others."
"It is nearly impossible for an American to get discharged their student loan debts. Two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job. The future, for them, doesn't look particularly promising. And it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt."
"Income-Based Tuition would link the cost of a major to the expected income. College administrators would be forced to manage costs better, to find innovative ways to do so. Users would be able to figure out how much money they will make from a given college and major."
"Some college grads pay 25 percent of their income servicing their student debt. That kind if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly, says author. For his generation, higher education was free because it was thought of as a public good. Not anymore."
The idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests is a real problem. Nonviolent activists can neutralize the military by causing soldiers to defect. They can disrupt the economy through strikes and boycotts. Powerful opponents are not going to give people what they want just because they asked nicely.
"A group of people in Guatemala called for the president to step down. The president refused, so the people took to the streets to demand his resignation. The people of Guatemala have shown that they can take action even if they don't have the power."
"Nonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare, if not more so. Nonviolent activists around the world are getting better at grabbing headlines, but these isolated actions do very little if they're not part of a larger strategy. A general wouldn't march his troops into battle unless he had a plan to win the war."
"Parents in Raqqa, Syria, refused to send their children to school because of ISIS. Frida Ghitis: It may be difficult to imagine defeating ISIS with action that is nonviolent. She says the greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence but in making it obsolete. Ghitis says we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful than the newest technologies of war."
 nonviolent struggle is at least as powerful and as effective as violence. Most people associate this type of action with Gandhi and Martin Luther King. People have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years. Most of the rights that we have today in this country weren't handed to us.
"Every time I check my email, I'm playing the slot machine to see, what am I going to get next? We want to have a relationship with technology that gives us back choice about how we spend time with it. We're going to need help from designers, because knowing this stuff doesn't help."
"Every time we interrupt each other, it takes us about 23 minutes, on average, to refocus our attention. We actually cycle through two different projects before we come back to the original thing we were doing. The more interruptions we get externally, it's conditioning and training us to interrupt ourselves."
"CNN.com's John Sutter has created a new way of answering questions. Sutter's new tool allows people to mark when they are focused and when they're not. The tool is designed to help people avoid accidental or mindless interruptions, he says."
"In a far richer country, the US, that number is only 10 percent. Haryana is a state which has 30 million people. It has 15,000 public schools and 2 million plus children in those public schools. The state and system is as large as that of Peru or Canada."
"By 2020, Haryana wants 80 percent of its children to be at grade-level knowledge. By the end of week one, we had 50 ideas on the table, all amazing, all sounded right. Having a very specific goal right up front has really allowed us to be very sharp and focused in our transformation journey."
"India has been fighting the challenge of access, having enough schools, and enrollment. At lunchtime, most teachers were spending all of their time getting the midday meal cooking, supervised and served to the students. What was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further or to monitor their attendance."
"There are 1 million such schools in India. ""Whatever we have to do has to be scalable, it has to work in all 15,000 schools,"" says Dr. Ravi Agrawal. ""I think this was definitely the point in time when my team hated me,"" he adds."
"By the time kids are 11, 50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education that they have no hope to recover. ""We spent a lot of long hours in office, in cafés, sometimes even in bars, scratching out heads and saying, ""Where are the solutions, how are we going to solve this problem?"" In the end, I think we did find solutions,"" he says."
"The department used to have a process which is very interesting. They would write a letter from the headquarters and send it to the next level, which was the district offices. It was a little bit ridiculous. Most of these schools don't have a computer or email. However, what the teachers do have are smartphones."
"Haryana is one of the few states in the country which is showing an improvement. Teachers are back inside classrooms, they're teaching, often with innovative techniques. Learning levels of children have stopped declining, and they have started going up. These are still early signs, there's a long way to go."

"VR is going to play an incredibly important role in the history of mediums. It's the first medium that actually makes the jump from our internalization of an author's expression of an experience, to our experiencing it firsthand. The same thing happens when we look at the cave painting version of the story, the book about the mammoth hunt."
"In all other mediums, your consciousness interprets the medium. Virtual reality bridges that gap. In VR today, we're more learning grammar than writing language. We've made 15 films in the last year at our VR company, Vrse. The potential for VR is enormous."
"The New York Times film crew tries to break every rule in the book to see what they can achieve. The result is a giant rectangle that stretches from the top to the bottom of the screen. ""We found that we have a unique, direct path into your senses, your emotions, even your body,"" says the film's director. ""Music guides us how to feel. It deepens every experience"""
"""Waves of Grace"" was a collaboration between Vrse, the United Nations, Gabo Arora, and Imraan Ismail. In virtual reality, composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you. A close-up in VR means you're actually close up to someone."
"VR makes anywhere and anyone feel local. That's why it works as an empathy machine. Our film ""Clouds Over Sidra"" takes you to a Syrian refugee camp. It's not using physical celluloid or paper or TV signals. It actually employs what we use to make sense of the world."
"What if instead of verbally telling you about a dream, I could let you live inside that dream? What if you could surf gravitational waves on the edge of a black hole, or create galaxies from scratch, or communicate with each other not using words but using our raw thoughts?

"Introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. introverts may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial."
"Introverted men engage in conjugal act 3.0 times per month, extroverts 5.5 times. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. Introverted men handle all the male extroverted, they pick up a few introverts."
"Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. When an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck"" and ""Chuckles Baby"""
"Psychologist Brian Greene is an introvert, but has a tendency to be more assertive than he should be. He is working on a project with a fellow called Michael, who he describes as ""as extroverted a person as you could find"" Michael's behavior almost brought the project to a crashing halt, Greene says."
"You're like some other people and like no other person. It's important that we know this. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital. Or it could be your mom."

"Bryan Johnson and his team had been documenting the over 4,000 lynchings of African-Americans in the American South. They had a plan to build a national memorial to the victims of lynching in Montgomery, Alabama. Johnson: ""Here we will build a new memorial that will change the identity of this city and of this nation"""
"The memorial will take us on a journey through a classical, almost familiar building type, like the Parthenon or the colonnade at the Vatican. But as we enter, the ground drops below us and our perception shifts, where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings, which happened in the public square."
"""Great architecture can give us hope,"" says the architect. ""It can help us to understand our own minds better,"" he says. ""Great art can help people understand their own minds,"" he adds. ""And that's what we're trying to do here"""
"The organ that does all the thinking and perceiving and imagining, of course, is the brain. You really can't say very much about a brain by just looking at it, at least with the naked eye. The first person who really developed some kind of insight into what was going on in the brain was the great Spanish neuroanatomist, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, in the 19th century."
"The structures you see are mitochondria that are the size of bacteria. The diameter of an average strand of hair is about 100 microns. From these kinds of serial electron microscopy slices, one can start to make reconstructions in 3D of neurons."
"The basic task of perception is to take an image like this one and say, ""That's a bird"" The classical computing paradigm is not one in which this task is easy to do, he says. This neural network could be biological, inside our visual cortices, or, nowadays, on the computer."
"An artificial neural network can identify a bird based on its colour and shape. The network can also be used to search for a specific species of bird. The technology is being developed by the University of California, San Diego. It is the first of its kind to be developed in the U.S."
"The problem is with this operator. It's a very, very complicated, very non-linear operation. We have to figure out a way to solve the equation without a division operator. The flip side of perception is creativity: turning a concept into something out there into the world."
A new way of looking at the world has emerged in the form of an image of a bird. The image was created using a neural network that was trained to recognize different types of bird. It's the same way that we learn by looking at images of different objects.
"The network is designed to recognize faces, to distinguish one face from another. It can also categorize man-made structures, animals, clouds and other objects. The image is a kind of cubist, surreal, psychedelic, psychedelic picture of me from multiple points of view at once."
CNN's Jim Boulden looks at how a neural network can be used to create images. He says the network is able to see the world through the eyes of the user. The network can also create images that are then seen by the user in a different way.
"Gill says she was almost one of the 26 people killed in the suicide bombing. She says the bomber dehumanized her as the ""other,"" the ""them,"" as opposed to ""us"" Gill: ""I could never have imagined that a 19-year-old suicide bomber would actually teach me a valuable lesson"""
"""I was so determined to survive that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs,"" she says. ""I held myself upright and I held on for almost an hour, an hour to contemplate the whole of my life up until this point"""
"""I was unable to speak, unable to say even a small word, like ""Gill"" I surrendered my body to them. Difference of any kind made no difference to the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go to save my life. To them, it didn't matter if I was rich or poor, the color of my skin or my sexual orientation."
"I am proof that unconditional love and respect can not only save, but it can transform lives. I believe the potential for widespread positive change is absolutely enormous because I know what we're capable of. I know the brilliance of humanity. Is what unites us not far greater than what can ever divide?"
"Gill Hicks: I've often wondered: What was he thinking? He didn't set out to kill or maim me, Gill Hicks. Instead, he gave me an unwarranted and an unwanted label. When will we embrace the wisdom of our era to rise above mere tolerance and move to an acceptance for all?"
"The genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time, maybe no more so than in this species here. This is a new species we described from Madagascar that we named Typhleotris mararybe. That means ""big sickness"" in Malagasy for how sick we got trying to collect this species."
"Cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology, John says. Each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way, and each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us. John also introduces James Cavitt, a man who has been through prison. Cavitt shares his journey of redemption through spoken word."
"""I live in a world that has been called ""hell on Earth"" by those trapped inside. But I've come to the stark realization that prison -- it really is what you make it"" ""I knew that my freedom was gonna come, it was just a matter of time. And so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile"""

"""None but ourselves can free our minds,"" he says. ""We have no fear for atomic energy,"" he adds. ""Some say it's just a part of it, we've got to fulfill the book"" ""It's not just about the money, it's about the humanity,"" he writes."
"A few years ago, SS made an educational video about the history of video games. For that one, he got to do the voice of Space Invader. When that video was posted online, he just sat there on the computer, hitting ""refresh,"" excited to see the response."
"I recorded my audio, but every time I sat down to edit, I just could not do it. I've stuttered for as long as I can remember. I was the kid in class who would never raise his hand when he had a question -- or knew the answer. Every single time, it would take me back to my childhood."
"I spent my childhood feeling that if I spoke, it would become obvious that there was something wrong with me, that I was not normal. Using my highly edited voice in my work was a way for me to finally sound normal to myself. Audio editing is like Photoshop for your voice."
"In ancient literature, Homer mentions very few colors. One theory is that cultures begin to recognize a color only once they have the ability to make it. A color like red was fairly easy for many cultures to make. But a color like blue, which was much harder to make, many cultures didn't begin to learn how to make that color until much later."
Writer says he's been discriminated against because of his accent. He says it's normal for a black student to have spelling errors and a white employee to be a better hire than a black employee. Writer: Discrimination results more from wanting to help people that you can relate to than the desire to harm people you can't relate to.
"In 2014, only about 11 percent of children's books had a character of color. Half of American children today come from a minority background. SS: Minority groups don't get to realize the great extent to which they are similar to minorities. ""I can challenge that preexisting notion of normal with my work and with my voice,"" she says."
"Safwat: How did a country with communities living harmoniously together degenerate into civil war? Safwat: There is a sure correspondence between the architecture of a place and the character of the community that has settled there. ""We must continuously challenge our notion of normal, because doing so is going to allow us to finally see the sky for what it is"""
"The old Islamic city in Syria was built over a multilayered past, integrating with it and embracing its spirit. People lived and worked with each other in a place that gave them a sense of belonging and made them feel at home. But over time, the ancient became worthless, and the new, coveted."
"Homs is now a half-destroyed city. Over time, the united city has morphed into a city center with ghettos along its circumference. From my point of view, losing the sense of belonging to a place has made it a lot easier to destroy."
"Baba Amr is a city in northern Syria that has been destroyed by the Syrian government. The city was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flows through the heart of the city. It was designed to be a place of community, not just a place for the elite."
"Homs is a city of tolerance, accustomed to variety, accommodating a wide range of beliefs, origins, customs, goods, food. We need to create again cities that are shared by the communities that inhabit them. If we do so, people will not feel the need to seek identities opposed to the other identities all around. They will all feel at home."
"All life on Earth derives its nourishment from only six chemical elements, and these elements can be found on any planetary body in our solar system. Many solar system bodies don't have liquid water, and so we don't look there. Other bodies might have abundant liquid water but it's trapped beneath an icy shell."
"If you have too little atmosphere and it's too thin and too cold, you end up like Mars, too cold. The same is true with planets. They're not static things. They change. They evolve. And atmospheres do the same. It's a Goldilocks-type problem, and a child could understand it."
"The atmosphere of Mars is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid. How do particles get enough energy to escape? Number one, sunlight. But Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time, and Mars and Earth as well."
The sun's light can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and warm the particles. The distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature. The solar wind may provide energy for atmospheric particles to escape and break free from the gravity of the planet.
" Magnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet by electrically conducting churning fluid material. Earth may have been protected for billions of years, because we've had a magnetic field. Other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the sails on a ship, enabling the planet to interact with more energy from solar wind."
"We know energy from the solar wind is being deposited into our atmosphere here on Earth. That energy is conducted along magnetic field lines down into the polar regions, resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora. We're trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way."
"The Kepler spacecraft has been observing a postage stamp-sized region of the sky for a couple years. We now believe that, of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone, on average, every star has at least one planet. Estimates suggest there are between 40 billion and 100 billion of those planets that we would define as habitable in just our galaxy."
"Life on Earth only needs three things: energy, food and water. Life deep underground can get its energy from things like chemical reactions. ""We separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state,"" he says. ""It can spread over acres and acres of area, or it could fit in a small space"""
"Every single element needed to make a forest is available right around us. We touch, feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks. If the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water, we will mix some more biomass. To grow, plants need water, sunlight and nutrition."
"""We have a forest in the back of our heads,"" says the author. ""It's a place where we can go and look at it and find out what it is."" The author says the forest is made up of different types of trees, some of which are very old."
"We plant the saplings close to each other. If we are making a fruit forest, we increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees. The soil is very soft -- so soft, that roots can penetrate into it easily, rapidly. Microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots."
"As the forest grows we keep watering it -- for the next two to three years, we water the forest. Eventually, the forest becomes so dense that sunlight can't reach the ground anymore. At this stage, every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn't evaporate back into the atmosphere."
A forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together. A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence. Most of the world we live in today was forest before human intervention. The winning algorithms were able to match the diagnoses given by human ophthalmologists.
"We have no chance of competing against machines on frequent, high-volume tasks. But there are things we can do that machines can't do. Machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations. This puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate."
"By the time Yahli goes to college, the jobs her parents do are going to look dramatically different. On frequent, high-volume tasks, machines are getting smarter and smarter. Accountants and lawyers are still needed. But machines will shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by."
Kaggle operates on the cutting edge of machine learning. It brings together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems. Machine learning started making its way into industry in the early '90s. Kaggle challenged its community to build an algorithm that could grade high-school essays.
"Recent observations have changed all that. It's now turning our attention to the right places for us to take a deeper look. The planet Mars and then three moons of the outer planets: Titan, Europa and small Enceladus. And if everything was there, including organics, perhaps life had started."
"Curiosity has also drilled in that red soil and brought up other material. Curiosity has also brought up carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur -- they were all there. So Mars in its past, with a lot of water, perhaps plenty of time, could have had life."
"The discovery of water on Mars tells us that Mars has all the ingredients necessary for life, says NASA's Jim Green. Green: We're going to launch a series of missions to begin that search for life on Mars. Enceladus is blasting sheets of water out into the solar system and sloshing back down onto the moon. The claims of having life beyond Earth need to be definitive."
"Hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in 1977. They're teeming with life, regardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline. Enceladus has water and has had it for a significant period of time. Another moon, very similar, is Europa."
"NASA's Cassini spacecraft has found liquid water on Saturn's moons Europa, Titan and Enceladus. If there are organics there, there may be life, NASA says. ""These moons are fabulous moons. These moons are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone, that are out in the solar system, have liquid water"""
"The ingredients of life are: liquid water, energy and organic material. If there's any place in the solar system where life is not like us, where the substitute of water is another solvent, it could be Titan. We see lakes ... almost the size of our Black Sea in some places."
"Environmental writer Bill McKibben called his book ""The End of Nature"" ""I disagree with this definition of nature, because, fundamentally, we are animals,"" he says. ""I think that nature is anywhere where life thrives, anywhere where there are multiple species together"""

"Fires, radio-collaring wolves, reintroducing bison are part of the plan to protect the environment. ""It takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched,"" says the author. ""These places that we love the most are the places we love a little too hard, sometimes"""
"There are so many rules and restrictions that from a child's point of view, this is, like, the worst nature ever. The Nature Conservancy did a survey of young people, and they asked them, how often do you spend time outdoors? Only two out of five spent time outdoors at least once a week."
"Every kid lives near nature. We've just somehow forgotten how to see it. There are over 50 plant species up there. There's pollination going on. This is an ecosystem, a functioning ecosystem. It's creating soil, it's sequestering carbon."
"Scientists have started calling ecosystems like these ""novel ecosystems,"" because they're often dominated by non-native species. ""Novel ecosystems"" are ""just unlike anything we've ever seen before,"" he says. ""You can make your own novel ecosystem, too. You just stop mowing your lawn,"" he adds."
"""We need to be very careful about how we define nature,"" he says. ""We cannot define nature as that which is untouched. This never made any sense anyway"" ""The only way we're going to raise up a generation of people who care about nature is by letting them touch nature"""

"Journalism has been slow to wake up to the possibilities that technology brings. The Panama Papers have forced journalism institutions to reexamine how they function. But where there is crisis, there is also opportunity, says CNN's John Defterios. ""It seems staggering that journalism has been so late to cover stories,"" he says."
"More than 350 reporters from 25 language groups worked together on the project. They agreed to share everything that they found with everybody else, and publish on the same day. Buried in the documents were secret offshore entities, such as Wintris Inc., a company in the British Virgin Islands."
"""The Panama Papers"" was one of the biggest stories of the year. The Panama Papers are a collection of documents from the world of business and politics. The papers were published in 76 countries at the same time as the FIFA World Cup in Brazil."
The Panama Papers were the biggest cache of inside information into the tax haven system that anyone had ever seen. They showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world by applying new methods and old-fashioned journalism techniques. The technology -- the Internet -- that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself.
"Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you. I guess you're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists who worked with you. Gerard Ryle: We had a series of crises along the way, including when something major was happening in the world, the journalists from that country wanted to publish."
"Gerard Schulder: Money is about the exchanges and the transactions that we have with each other. He says there's nothing inherently valuable about a dollar or a stone or a coin. The only reason these things have any value is because we've all decided they should, he says."
"In the past two decades, we've begun to use digital money. There's not even anything physical, like a stone or a coin. Digital money makes it so that I can pay around the world in seconds. Half my credit cards still don't work in Europe. That's friction."
"An entrepreneur in India can set up an online business in minutes, but it's hard for her to get loans and to get paid: friction. Digital money isn't really mine, it's entries in databases that belong to my bank, my credit card company or my investment firm."
"We're about to enter a new phase of money. Money will be directed by software, and it will just safely and securely flow. Cryptocurrencies are the first step of this evolution. They are digital money that isn't run by any government or bank."
"Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous cryptocurrency, but there are hundreds of them. Cryptocurrencies are based on a special field of mathematics called cryptography. During World War II, breaking cryptosystems like Enigma was critical to decoding enemy transmissions and turning the tide of the war."
"Bitcoin is based on the same idea that the Yap used, this collective global knowledge of transfers. In Bitcoin, I spend by transferring Bitcoin, and I get paid when someone transfers Bitcoin to me. This means that we don't have to rely on the banks anymore to secure our transactions."
The Bitcoin network uses special hardware to solve the puzzle. It's the first step to a world with a global programmable money. The next step is to make it easier for people to get their hands on the coins and make their own transactions.
"Programmable money will change the way we pay, allocate and decide on value, he says. The Internet caused an explosion of innovation, because it was built upon an open architecture. Micro-payments are actually going to change how security works in our world, he adds."
"We're entering a new era of programmable money. It's very exciting, but it's also a little bit scary. Cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal transactions, just like cash is used for crime in the world today. Who's advantaged in this new world and who isn't?"
"""We need to reestablish local involvement in our forests,"" he says. ""This means less cutting, less cutting of the forest"" ""It's going to create new, flexible forms of employment,"" he adds. ""We're going to have to be more creative in our thinking"""
"Jigs's fall into the outhouse showed me this other world, and it changed my view of forests. We have to give Mother Nature the tools she needs to use her intelligence to self-heal. forests aren't just a bunch of trees competing with each other, they're supercooperators."
"Trees in real forests might also share information below ground, he says. He grew 80 replicates of three species: paper birch, Douglas fir, and western red cedar. ""It was in its own other world,"" he says of the forest. ""I wanted to change the way you think about forests"""
"CNN's John Sutter has been conducting research in Canada's boreal forest. Sutter injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas, into the bag of birch. He then injected the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas into the fir bag. He was wondering whether there was two-way communication between the trees."
"The C-13 and C-14 was showing that paper birch and Douglas fir were in a lively two-way conversation. It turns out at that time of the year, in the summer, that birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch."
"I knew I had found something big, something that would change the way we look at how trees interact in forests, from not just competitors but to cooperators. I truly hoped and believed that my discovery would change how we practice forestry, from clear-cutting and herbiciding to more holistic and sustainable methods."
"CNN's John Sutter grew up in the forests of British Columbia. Sutter: ""I used to lay on the forest floor and stare up at the tree crowns"" ""Mycorrhiza"" literally means ""fungus root,"" Sutter says."
"The biggest, darkest nodes are the busiest nodes. Mother trees colonize their kin with bigger mycorrhizal networks. They send them more carbon below ground. They even reduce their own root competition to make elbow room for their kids. When mother trees are injured or dying, they also send messages of wisdom."
"The forest is vulnerable to natural disturbances like bark beetles and high-grade logging and clear-cut logging. Forests aren't simply collections of trees, they're complex systems with hubs and networks that overlap and connect trees. They provide avenues for feedbacks and adaptation and this makes the forest resilient."
"The World Resources Institute reports that Canada has had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide. ""Instead of weakening our forests, how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change?"" asks the author. ""We can't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on,"" he says."
"""We're doing one step better. We're designing for reuse, only now we're planning for it"" ""The most important thing about this system isn't the technicals of how it works. It's how you feel about it"""
"In Portland, Oregon, I can't take Echo for a swim during the rainy season, because we dump raw sewage sometimes into our river. Seven million people get sick every year, 900 die annually. How we feel about any particular new technique gets into everything we do: how we talk about it, how we encourage people to study."
40 percent of municipalities self-report dumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways. Half of all of your poop and pee is going to fertilize farmland. The other half is being incinerated or land-filled. The average wastewater treatment plant can remove maybe half of the drugs that come in.
"Each one of us is pooping and peeing something that could fertilize half or maybe all of our food, depending on our diet. Carbon, if we're getting that into the soil, is going to bind to the other minerals and nutrients in there. Boom! Healthier food."
"In New Mexico, people are using their sewage to water an orchard. In Oregon, they're using it to water their homes. The idea is to save money and help the environment. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a step in the right direction."
This was the first permit of its kind in Oregon. San Francisco realized that it made sense to invest in rebates for every household to reuse their wash water and their rainwater. The amount of water they would save as a community would be so big. And all that was cheaper than updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure.
Think about it -- solar power used to be uncommon and unaffordable. Now it's more a part of our web of power than ever before. We now have sources of power like the sun that don't vary with our earthly dramas. What's driving all that innovation? It's us.
"Nearly 70 percent of all our energy consumption is oil. Transportation system is totally dependent on fossil fuels, like it is in most countries. Costa Rica is a great candidate in pioneering a vision for development without fossil fuels. This is a very complex challenge, and I believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition."
"Costa Rica abolished its army in 1949. The president at the time, José Figueres, found a powerful way by smashing the walls of an army base. In the '40s, Costa Ricans were given free education and free health care. In '90s, we pioneered payments for ecosystem services."
"Fossil fuels create climate change. We know that, and we know how vulnerable we are to the impacts. As a developing country, it is in our best interest to build development without fossil fuels that harm people in the first place. Abolishing the army, investing in nature and people, did something very powerful."
"Transportation has become an existential issue for us Costa Ricans. The model we have is not working for us. It's hurting people, it's hurting companies, and it's hurt our health. And people are turning violent in a country that is otherwise happy in pura vida."
"""We don't want cities that are built for cars. We want cities for people where we can walk and we can use bikes,"" he says. ""We have to change, but incremental change is not going to be sufficient,"" he adds. ""The world is stuck with oil, and so is Costa Rica, so let's keep our army"""
"""We're talking about breaking free from fossil fuels,"" says Lina Khatib. ""We're not talking about more cars, we are talking about a new way of life"" ""We want to be able to live in a world that is more sustainable,"" she says. ""That's what we're trying to achieve"""
"""People feel powerless, and they are tired of not being heard,"" he says. ""This is not a question of climate policy or environmental agenda. It's about the country that we want and the cities that we have"" ""It's hard to believe these were military barracks at the end of the '40s,"" he adds. ""We started a new life without an army"""
"TED will begin the 2016 TED Prize platform in Latin America, more specifically Peru. In July of 1911, a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor set out from his rainforest camp with his team. We will be taking Hiram Bingham's impossible dream and turning it into an amazing future."

"The project was the first funded by National Geographic. The site was discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham. The project will use state-of-the-art technology to map an entire country. It will also make archaeological exploration more open, inclusive and at a scale not previously possible."
"Every day when my daughter plays when she dresses up, she's learning stuff through a process that, in my own line of work, as a professor of media studies, we refer to as public pedagogy. That is, it is how societies are taught ideologies. It's how you learned what it means to be a man or a woman, what it meant to behave yourself in public."
"In 1983, 90 percent of American media were owned by 50 companies. In 2015, that number has shrunk to six, six companies. NBCUniversal Comcast, AOL Time Warner, the Walt Disney Company, News Corp, Viacom and the CBS Corporation. These six companies produce nine out of every 10 movies you watch."

"Gamora is a three-time, back-to-back state champion in Shaolin Kempo. Black Widow is the star of not one, not two, but five different Marvel movies. If you go to the Disney store and look for a Black Widow costume, you will find Captain America and Thor."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about the lack of female leads in comic book movies. Sutter says his daughter is athletic, but she's been replaced with a male figure. He says it's not fair to his daughter and not fair for other children."
"""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"" is marketed to girls ages five to nine. But there are millions of boys and grown men who enjoy the show. They call themselves Bronies, pony bros, guys who like ponies. ""We have developed a society in which you would rather be dead as a boy,"" he says."
"""We have to stop making it so that the only female superheroes appear on shirts that are pink and cut for girls,"" she says. ""Just this year, Target announced that they were going to stop gendering their toy aisles,"" she adds. ""We have failed our children. And we have to do better for them"""
"The song is called ""Mycelia"" and was written in the early 1980s. The song is about a young girl and her love for her mother. It was written to make her feel better about her mother's death. She died in a car accident in 2009."
Blockchain is a technology that could revolutionize the way commerce is done. The technology could be used to transfer money from one person to another. But it could also lead to problems for people who don't have enough money to have a bank account.
"What if there were an internet of value -- some kind of vast, global, distributed ledger running on millions of computers and available to everybody? What if every kind of asset, from money to music, could be stored, moved, transacted, exchanged and managed, all without powerful intermediaries?"
"Bitcoin is a digital currency that lets people transact peer-to-peer. It's not controlled by a nation-state, but by a group of people called ""miners"" These miners have massive computing power at their fingertips -- 10 to 100 times bigger than all of Google worldwide."
"The Bitcoin blockchain is just one of many systems that can be used to create a chain of blocks. The first miner to find out the truth and to validate the block is rewarded in digital currency, in the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, with Bitcoin. ""This is infinitely more secure than the computer systems that we have today"""
"Blockchain technology could be used to redistribute wealth, says Richard Quest. Quest: Could we change the way that wealth gets created in the first place by democratizing wealth creation? Quest: Can we engage more people in the economy, and then ensure that they got fair compensation?"
CNN's John Sutter says the sharing economy is a good idea when it comes to financial assets. Sutter: But sending people a copy of your assets is a really bad idea. He says companies like Airbnb and TaskRabbit are not really sharing.
"The biggest flow of funds from the developed world to the developing world is not corporate investment, and it's not even foreign aid. It's remittances. The big sharing-economy disruptors in Silicon Valley could be disrupted, and this would be good for prosperity."
"Data is a new asset class, maybe bigger than previous asset classes. The virtual you is not owned by you -- that's the big problem. A lot of transactions, the seller doesn't even need to know who you are. This is a big opportunity for prosperity."

Imogen Heap, the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, is now putting music on a blockchain ecosystem. Heap: In many parts of the world, we're raised to believe that strangers are dangerous by default."
"The author says most strangers aren't dangerous. Using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done. Categories are something our brains use. When it comes to people, it's sort of a shortcut for learning about them. It is good to be friendly, and it's good to learn when not to be."
"We see male, female, young, old, black, brown, white, stranger, friend, and we use the information in that box. It's quick, it's easy and it's a road to bias. It means we're not thinking about people as individuals. Sociologists call it ""fleeting intimacy"""
"Researchers found that people communicate better with strangers than spouses. The reason is that it's a quick interaction that has no consequences. We have a bias when it comes to people we're close to, and we expect them to understand us. The special form of closeness gives us something we need as much as we need our friends."
"With a stranger, we have to start from scratch. We tell the whole story, we explain who the people are, how we feel about them. And guess what? Sometimes they do understand us a little better. There are unwritten rules we tend to follow. The rules are very different depending on what country you're in."
"Many Danes are so averse to talking to strangers, that they would rather miss their stop on the bus than say ""excuse me"" to someone that they need to get around. In Egypt, I'm told, it's rude to ignore a stranger, and there's a remarkable culture of hospitality."
"You can always talk to their dog or their baby. You can tell by how they respond whether they're open to talking more. The last one I want to challenge you to is disclosure. This is a very vulnerable thing to do, and it can be very rewarding."
"""When you talk to strangers, you're making beautiful interruptions into the expected narrative of your daily life and theirs,"" he says. ""Always in those moments, they share their own experiences of loss,"" he adds. ""We tend to meet disclosure with disclosure, even with strangers,"" he writes."
"Tepperman says the real obstacle is not ability, and it's not circumstances. Making big changes involves taking big risks, he says. Overcoming that fear requires guts, and as you all know, gutsy politicians are painfully rare. But that doesn't mean we voters can't demand courage from our political leaders."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how three countries have overcome immigration problems. He finds that Canada is among the most welcoming countries in the world. Sutter: ""There's really no other option"" than to work on the issue of immigration."
"Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy. The real explanation involves the man who became Canada's leader in 1968, Pierre Trudeau. Trudeau was a French speaker in a country long-dominated by its English elite."
"Canada threw out its old race-based immigration rules and replaced them with new color-blind ones. Trudeau created the world's first policy of official multiculturalism to promote integration and the idea that diversity was the key to Canada's identity. In 1998, the people of Indonesia took to the streets to overthrow their dictator."
"In 1999, Islamist parties scored 36 percent of the vote in Indonesia's first free elections. Since then, however, Indonesia has taken a surprising turn. While ordinary folks have grown more pious on a personal level, politics have moved in the opposite direction."
"CNN's John Sutter returns to Mexico to talk about the country's transformation. He says the country has made progress, but it still has a long way to go. Sutter: ""It's not like I'm particularly optimistic about the future of Mexico"""
"Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto is credited with striking a deal with the country's three warring political parties. Over the next 18 months, they together passed an incredibly comprehensive set of reforms. Peña knew that he needed to build trust early, so he started talking to the opposition just days after his election."
"CNN's John Sutter looks at how three countries overcame their great challenges. He finds a few common threads between the three countries. Sutter: ""You can't simply take what worked in one, port it to another and expect it to work"""
Justin Trudeau's genius was to realize that Canada's crisis had swept away all the hurdles that usually block reform. The long cold war between its French and its English communities had just become a hot one. It gave Trudeau a once-in-a-generation opportunity to break the old rules.
"The leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, is under fire for his handling of the Ebola crisis. He has been accused of being too soft on the disease, which has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people in the last year."
"Reggie Watts: If we're going to do something, we've got to just make a decision. Jane McGonigal: This is the face of someone who, against all odds, is on the verge of an epic win. Arthur Benjamin: Mathematics is not just solving for x, it's also figuring out why."
"Without power, we have nothing to supply the chain of those who are truly curious to solve all of our current conditions, says Rush. Rush: ""This is the face we need to see on millions of problem solvers worldwide, as we try to tackle the challenges of the next century"""
"Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do. I want people to know that growing your own food is like printing your own money. I'm a people person. I love words, too -- just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer."
"Political scientist Victor Asal and colleagues have looked at several factors that shape a political group's choice of tactics. The greatest predictor of a movement's decision to adopt nonviolence is its ideology regarding the role of women in public life. When a movement includes in its discourse language around gender equality, it increases dramatically the chances it will adopt non violence."
Women are often more powerful than men in the world of business and politics. But they are often left out of the decision-making process. Women need to be involved in the decision making process to be able to make a difference in the business world.
"Women were key to the success of the First Intifada, writes Frida Ghitis. Ghitis: We need to focus more on the role of women in the Middle East. She says women are often overlooked in media coverage of the conflict."
"Despite their extraordinary achievements, none of these women have made it into our narrative of the First Intifada. The stories we tell matter deeply to how we see ourselves and how we believe movements are run. One of the most critical variables in determining whether a movement will be successful or not is a movement's ideology regarding the role of women."
CNN's John Sutter looks at the lessons of constructive conflict in the Middle East. Sutter: Nonviolent campaigns are almost 100 percent more likely to lead to success than violent campaigns. He asks: Is it better off getting a big house with a white picket fence or earning as much as you can?
"In the wake of the Great Recession, more and more Americans are redefining what ""better off"" really means. We talk about poverty as if it were a monolithic experience; about the poor as if they were solely victims. The art of living well is often practiced most masterfully by the most vulnerable."
"CNN's John Defterios is a journalist and author. He has written several books on the history of journalism. His latest book, ""The Power of One,"" is based on his experiences as a journalist in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s."
"""We live in tenuous times. We need to make sure we don't lose our sense of what it means to be a human being,"" says John Sutter. Sutter: ""We need to stop thinking about what we want to be when we grow up"""
"The challenge ahead is to reinvent the social safety net to fit this increasingly fragmented economy. We need policies that reflect that everyone deserves to be vulnerable or care for vulnerable others, without becoming destitute. Many Americans are rejecting the white picket fence and reclaiming village life."
"CoAbode, an online platform for single moms looking to share homes with other single moms, has 50,000 users. People over 65 are especially prone to be looking for these alternative living arrangements. The healthiest, happiest and even safest Americans are Americans who live lives intertwined with their neighbors."
"The ""new better off"" is less about investing in the perfect family and more about the imperfect village. ""The most reliable wealth is found in relationship,"" says the author. ""If you think you're a failure, you might be a success by standards you have not yet honored"""
"In the midst of such widespread uncertainty, we may, in fact, be insecure. But we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple. Or we can turn outward, cultivate faith in our ability to reach out, to connect, to create."
"""There's no room in the afternoons, because everything has to be enriching,"" she says. ""We tell our kids, don't just join a club, start a club. And check the box for community service. That is the beautiful struggle"""
"""There's a certain style of parenting these days that is kind of messing up kids, impeding their chances to develop into theirselves,"" she says. ""They see in our faces that our approval, that our love, that their very worth, comes from A's,"" she adds."
CNN's John Sutter says too many parents over-help their kids. He says this deprives kids of the chance to build self-efficacy. Sutter: Kids need a foundation for their success built on things like love and chores.
"The Harvard Grant Study said that happiness in life comes from love, not love of work. John Sutter: Childhood needs to teach our kids how to love, and they can't love others if they don't first love themselves. He says instead of being obsessed with grades and scores, we need to close our technology and look them in the eye."
"CNN's John Sutter: ""The evidence is in this room, is in our communities, that this is the truth"" ""It is hardly the end of the world if our kids don't go to one of those big brand-name schools,"" Sutter says. ""My job is not to make them become what I would have them become,"" he says."
"Sally Kohn: We're in a clean energy revolution, but it's not all good news. Kohn says fossil fuels like coal and oil are being replaced by solar and wind. She says it's bad news for the environment, but good news for consumers."
"CNN's John Defterios reports on the state of clean energy in the U.S. He says California has been reducing emissions more slowly than the national average. Defterio: ""We're actually having more serious problems than both Germany and California"" India is building 10 times more solar power than California."
"Nuclear power provides a lot of power -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A single plant can provide power 92 percent of the time. Even oil is more popular than nuclear. People don't really fear coal in the same way they fear nuclear."
"Climate scientist James Hansen went to China to look at the country's nuclear program. Hansen: The presentations were all very exciting and very promising. But when it came to the thorium reactor, Hansen says he was surprised by the timeline. Hansen asks: Is this whole global warming problem going to be a lot easier to solve than anybody imagined?"
"The world is at risk of losing four times more clean energy than we lost over the last 10 years. The U.S. could lose half of our reactors over the next 15 years, wiping out 40 percent of the emissions reductions we're supposed to get under the Clean Power Plan."
"Nuclear power is the safest way to make reliable power, according to studies. The majority of harm is caused by people panicking, and they're panicking because they're afraid. Nuclear waste is not poisoning people or doing something -- it's just sitting there, just being monitored."
"Waste from energy production kills seven million people a year, he says. ""Even if we get good at using that waste as fuel, there's always going to be some fuel left over"" ""I think we should triple the amount of money we're spending on it,"" he says of nuclear power."
"Psychology professor: Why do some people do selfless things, like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people who engage in such acts different than other people."
Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins. It results in a personality that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial behavior. Psychopaths are insensitive to signs that other people are in distress. They have difficulty recognizing fearful expressions like this one.
"The brains of these extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress. Their amygdalas are larger than average as well, by about eight percent."
"Fewer than 2,000 Americans have ever given a kidney to a stranger. When asked why, many altruists say, ""There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else"" The best description for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility."
"As societies become wealthier and better off, people seem to turn their focus of attention outward. As a result, all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases. But even as the world is becoming a better and more humane place, there's a very common perception that it's becoming worse."
"In the United States, the law protects an employee's right to discuss their pay. But keeping salaries secret leads to what economists call ""information asymmetry"" In one famous example, writers in the Algonquin Round Table showed up for work with their salaries on their chests."
"Economists warn that information asymmetry can cause markets to go awry. Two-thirds of everyone who is paid at the market rate said they felt they were underpaid. 60 percent said that they intended to quit, regardless of where they were."
"Entrepreneurs and corporate leaders have been experimenting with sharing salaries for years. Openness remains the best way to ensure fairness, and pay transparency does that. When people know how they're being paid and how that pay compares to their peers', they're more likely to work hard."
"Some companies post the formula for calculating pay, and others post the pay levels. The assumed reason is that if everybody knew what everybody got paid, then all hell would break loose. But what if secrecy is actually the reason for all that strife? And what would happen if we removed that secrecy?"
"When I opened Mott Hall Bridges Academy in 2010, my goal was simple: open a school to close a prison. It turns out that pay transparency -- sharing salaries openly across a company -- makes for a better workplace. To date, we have had three graduating classes, at a 98-percent graduation rate."
"Mott Hall Bridges Academy is located in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. The school is one of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods in all of New York City. Vidal Chastanet, a scholar at the school, was inspired by the story of a young man from Brownsville who witnessed violence firsthand."
"""We must believe in their brilliance, and remind them that there indeed is power in education,"" she says. ""If our children are not in our classrooms, how will they learn? And if they're not learning, where would they end up?"""
"In the decades since Selma and the Voting Rights Act, this face-to-face culture of voting has just about disappeared. The couch has replaced the commons. Screens have made citizens into spectators. What we need today is an electoral culture that is about being together together, in person."
"In Taiwan and Hong Kong, there is a spectacle to the street theater of elections. In America, who has time for this? The average American watches five hours of television a day. That's why a group of colleagues and I launched a new project called ""The Joy of Voting"""
"A new series of ""I voted"" stickers was created by an artist who had never voted. The project is called ""The Joy of Voting"" The artist asked for poems, monologues, dialogues, snippets of anything that could be read aloud."
Voting matters because it is a self-fulfilling act of belief. It feeds the spirit of mutual interest that makes any society thrive. It's no accident that democracy and theater emerged around the same time in ancient Athens. Both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual.
"CNN's John Sutter asks: Why bother voting? He says it's not just a matter of making the time or having the know-how. Sutter: Not voting is actively handing power over to those whose interests are counter to your own. ""There is no possibility of our votes adding up to anything"""
"In the 2012 presidential election, young voters, Latino voters, Asian-American voters, low-income voters, all showed up at less than 50 percent. In the 2014 midterm elections, turnout was 36 percent, which was a 70-year low. In your average local election, turnout hovers somewhere around 20 percent."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about growing up in a poor family in Ohio. Sutter: ""Upward mobility is an abstract term, but it strikes at something that's very core at the heart of the American Dream"" ""In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK, very likely to live their share,"" Sutter says."
"The American Dream in those parts of the country is in a very real sense just a dream. The really talented people, because they can't find high-skilled work at home, end up moving elsewhere. There are failing schools in a lot of these communities, failing to give kids the educational leg up."
"If you grow up in an area like this, you see affirmative action as a tool to hold people like you back. You see it as something that's actively conspiring, where people with political and financial power are working against you. Even if you don't give in to that hopelessness, it's sometimes hard to know what those choices are."
"Yale student says he didn't know that elite universities are cheaper for low-income kids because they have bigger endowments, can offer more generous financial aid. He says he learned from his community how to shoot a gun, but didn't learn how to get ahead. Working-class kids are much more likely to face ""adverse childhood experiences,"" he says."
"40 percent of low-income kids face multiple instances of childhood trauma, according to a study by the Wisconsin Children's Trust Fund. ""This is not an isolated problem. This is a very significant issue,"" says the study's author. "" trauma is our culture's very worst gift to our children,"" he says."
"""I did beat the odds. I graduated from high school, from college, and I have a pretty good job now"" ""I came from a southern Ohio steel town, and it's a town that's really struggling in a lot of ways"" ""It's hard to tell a kid that life isn't fair, but also recognize and enforce the reality that their choices matter"""
"CNN's John Sutter talks to CNN iReport. Sutter: ""Without the Marine Corps, I would have never had access to that knowledge"" ""We need to ask questions about how we give social capital, mentorship to low-income kids,"" he says."
"There's a very unique sense of pessimism that's moved in, he says. ""I don't have all the answers, but I know that unless our society starts asking better questions about why I was so lucky, we're going to continue to have a very significant problem"""
"The world has changed so much in the last few decades that a map of the planet is needed. The world is changing at a rate of 2% a year, and we are only just starting to see the effects of this. We are learning how to live in a new way every day."
"In the '70s, '80s, the '90s, and in this decade, even faster -- our population growth is slowing. Our planet is stabilizing. We are heading towards nine, 10, or 11 billion people by the end of the century. We worry about how many people there are."
"Every year, we are coming off the land globally. We are packing in more densely. There are wolves again in Europe, and the wolves are moving west across the continent. We have enough water. We now know that. And you see the monsoons moving around the planet."
"This is a map of where we grow our food in the world. This is the areas that we will rely on most for rice and maize and corn. People worry that there won't be enough food, but we know there is enough food for everybody."
"There are a huge number of good news stories in the world. Infant mortality is falling and has been falling at an incredible rate. More children are going to school and learning to read and write. The highest number of young people going to university are women, not men."
"We are living in a stabilizing world, an urbanizing world and an aging world, he says. The Sahara and the Himalayas, in which there are few people, have been shrunk away. CRISPR is a system that we stole from an ancient, ancient bacterial immune system."
"This is a technology -- it's for genome editing -- and it's so versatile and so controversial that it's sparking all sorts of really interesting conversations. The guide RNA and the Cas9 protein complex together go bouncing along the genome. When they find a spot where the guide RNA matches, then it inserts between the two strands of the double helix."
"CRISPR is going to be amazing, in terms of the number of different scientific advances that it's going to catalyze. The thing that's special about it is this modular targeting system. So now, you can put whatever you want in the center and the cell gets fooled. The cost of the average materials for an experiment will go from thousands to hundreds of dollars."
"The Broad Institute and UC Berkeley are in this incredible patent battle. It's really fascinating to watch it happen, because they're accusing each other of fraudulent claims. The devil is always in the details. We don't really know that much about cells. They're still kind of black boxes."
"If you want to get into the whole body, you're probably going to have to use a virus. CRISPR has some off-target effects, a very small percentage, but they're still there. We're a long way away from figuring out how to give a pig wings, for example."
"""This is the story of CRISPR we should be telling,"" he says. ""CRISPR is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists to do really, really important work"" ""I've made it my personal mission to make sure that as many people as possible understand these types of technologies,"" he adds."
"Dorothy played Weasel Wyzell on NBC's ""Saved by the Bell: The New Class"" Dorothy: As a blind man, I confront others' incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day. Dorothy: Going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open."
"From age 12 to 25, Michael Schulder's retinas progressively deteriorated. His sight became an increasingly bizarre carnival funhouse hall of mirrors and illusions. Objects appeared, morphed and disappeared in his reality. He learned that what we see is not universal truth. It is not objective reality."
"Your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world, other knowledge, your memories, opinions, emotions, mental attention. These linkages work both ways, and usually occur subconsciously. What you see impacts how you feel, and the way you feel can literally change what you see."
"ophobia is a fear of the unknown. Fear replaces the unknown with the awful. Under the warped logic of fear, anything is better than the uncertain. When you face a compelling opportunity to take action, fear lulls you into inaction. Fear is self-realizing."
"When diagnosed with blinding disease, I knew blindness would ruin my life. It was a lie, but it was my reality, just like those backwards-swimming fish in little Dorothy's mind. If I had not confronted the reality of my fear, I would have lived it, I am certain of that."
"The author says he chose to step out of fear's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined. He shares his life with Dorothy, his beautiful wife, with their triplets, and with the latest addition to the family, sweet baby Clementine. ""You are the creator of your reality,"" he says."
"Isaac Lidsky is a CEO of a company in Florida. He says going blind was a profound blessing, because blindness gave him vision. Bruno Giussani: What lies do you tell yourself? How do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions? Lidky: ""I hope you can see what I see"""
"The language I'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming the world's universal language, for better or for worse. The idea that a language channels your thoughts is a marvelously enticing idea, but it's kind of fraught. I've learned to solicit a lot more verbal feedback."
"In French and Spanish the word for table is, for some reason, marked as feminine. So if you're French or Spanish, to you, a table is kind of a girl, as opposed to if you are an English speaker. It's hard not to love data like that, and many people will tell you that that means that there's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages."
"If you want to imbibe a culture, you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in. There's a movie by the Canadian film director Denys Arcand -- read out in English on the page, ""Dennis Ar-cand"" He did a film called ""Jesus of Montreal"""
"More Chinese people are learning English than English speakers are learning Chinese. To go into a culture and to only ever process people through that kind of culture is to never truly get the culture. And then, third -- languages are just an awful lot of fun."
There are two dozen universities in China right now teaching all in English. Learning how to speak with different word order is like driving on the different side of a street if you go to certain country. It's never been easier to teach yourself another language. English is taking over.
"At the end of the century, almost all of the languages that exist now -- there are about 6,000 -- will no longer be spoken. The idea of having any language you wanted in your pocket, coming from your phone, would have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people."
"Ravi Agrawal: I came to the U.S. from India at the age of 17. He says he became an American citizen after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. He started an organization to help young people who had been affected by the attacks. Agrawali: ""I'm one of the last of my people to be able to say that I am an American"""
"The Office of Immigrant Affairs was set up after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. The first commissioner was a young woman from Belize. She says she was shocked by the level of concern for immigrants in New York City. ""Most of us don't really know the difference, do we?"" she says."
"In 2012, half of the Latino and Asian-American voters did not vote. ""It doesn't just matter who can vote, it matters who does vote,"" says Ruben Navarrette. ""We actually have the power to change the outcome of elections"""
"Lan Diep, the eldest son of political refugees from Vietnam, ran for a seat in the San Jose City Council. Fewer than 2 percent of those offices are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos. In the city of Yakima, Washington, there has never been a Latino on the city council."
"Athena Salman won a seat on the Yakima City Council. Her father is part Mexican and her mother is part Italian. Salman: Immigrants' votes, voices and vantage points are what we all need to work to include in American democracy."
"CNN's Richard Quest was born in India and moved to the U.S. at the age of 17. Quest wrote a letter to his attacker, humanizing him as part of the community that he had so violently abused. Quest: ""I have fought to be in this country and I continue to do so every day"""
"""We will continue to come together, like an army, when any member of our community is threatened,"" says the letter. The hashtag #NotGuilty was created to encourage people to share their stories of sexual assault. The letter has been shared more than 2,000 times on social media."
"""I feel hopeful that if so many women can move forward, I can, too,"" says activist. ""The problem with reacting in this manner is it can sometimes mean that we don't actually react at all,"" she says. ""It might make us feel better, but it doesn't actually change anything,"" she adds."
"The Oxford University student was attacked on her way home from work. She wrote a letter to her attacker, which was published in a British tabloid. Twitter trolls were quick to create more injustice, she says. She says people forget that what they're doing is a public act."
The #NotGuilty campaign was launched to raise awareness of sexual assault. The campaign aims to hold those who have done us injustice to account. It is also a call for social media to be used in a more considered way to respond to injustice. The hashtag has raised awareness of the issue of sexual abuse.
"Social media can be used as a tool to educate, to stimulate dialogues. You can not speak over those directly affected by an injustice. Let us hold people to account, without descending into a culture that thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves."
"CNN's Richard Quest was mugged in Mandalay, Burma, in October. Quest was photographed topless and barelegged in front of the police. Quest: ""There are few things more ""right"" in this world than bringing people together"""
"At home, it's dangerously easy to assume we're on top of things. But out in the world, you are reminded every moment that you're not, and you can't get to the bottom of things, either. ""People wish to be settled,"" Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us."
"Dalai Lama: ""I don't know"" is the one thing that gives people reassurance and confidence. Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman says we are always more confident of what we think we know than we should be. Most of the time, we're in the dark."
The author has lived in Japan for 28 years. He says he has learned that the illusion of knowledge can be more dangerous than ignorance. The author has been a full-time writer for 34 years and has written for Time Magazine for 20 years.
"In the end, perhaps, being human is much more important than being fully in the know. And the same is true in love or in moments of crisis. He'd earned a degree in mathematics. His dream was to be a teacher. But of course, life is hard under a military dictatorship."
"Ehud: ""I was just outraged that, how come this is the best that we can offer?"" ""We're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer,"" he says. ""You'll see lung cancer, for example, on the rise,"" he adds."
"Cancer research has come a long way in 50 years, but there's more work to be done, he says. ""We have a lot of heavy lifting to still do ahead of us,"" he adds. ""It's the invention of the refrigerator, and the fact that we're no longer eating spoiled meats"""
"Patients are injected with sugar molecules that are going all over the body looking for cells that are hungry for sugar. In each and every one of these small little blips that you're seeing on the image, there needs to be at least 100 million cancer cells in order to be detected."
"A friend of mine was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer. ""Brain cancer tissue and healthy brain tissue really just look the same,"" he says. ""So I remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab, and we say, ""Boy, there's got to be a better way"""
"""There's just got to be a better way here,"" he says. ""We will inject these gold particles into these patients by the billions again, and we'll have them go all over the body"" ""If you're a cancer cell, we're sticking in and shining out and telling us, ""Hey, look at me, I'm here,"" ""Here's the tumor"""
"The most important thing is that we did not have to take huge amounts of healthy brain in the process. 80 to 90 percent of brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail because of those small little extra margins that were left positive. The good news is that there are tons of different treatments to choose from, but the bad news is it takes three months to tell if a treatment is even working."
"An ability to see each and every one of the cells might also allow us to ask insightful questions. In the lab, we are now getting to a point where we can actually start asking these cancer cells real questions. So if you're not responding, we'll know to stop the treatment right away, days into the treatment."
"Paintings of people in water were a challenge for the artist for more than a decade. ""I was driven by this kind of impulsive curiosity, always looking for something new to add: vinyl, steam, glass, Vaseline,"" he says."
"In October 2011, the artist's mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. The cancer had spread to her bones, and it was in her brain. ""I fell to my knees. I totally lost it. I realized, this isn't about me. This is about figuring out how to help her,"" she says."
"""I was giving up trying to control the uncontrollable and just being there in it with her,"" he says. ""She knew what was happening, and she knew what the doctors and the internet didn't know"" ""I just needed to ask her, 'Is this what you want me to do?' And she said, 'Yes' """
"""It was as though our whole family vanished and we were all together,"" she says. ""It was exactly where I wanted to be,"" she adds. ""We were all there for each other. We were all in the same place"""
"""It's like a release of everything that was unraveling in me. That safe, very, very carefully rendered safe place that I created in all my other paintings, it was a myth. It didn't matter. It was what I always wanted"""
"The artist's mother took him to art classes from the age of eight to 16. He says the chaos and the imperfections of the woods were fascinating him again. ""I started to be as curious as I was when I was a student. I had no plan, but I was watching what was happening,"" he says."

"""Let's take the opportunity to find something beautiful in the unknown, in the unpredictable, and even in the awful,"" he says. Most of us spend the majority of our waking hours involved in organizations. ""Always-on transformation? That sounds exhausting,"" his wife Nicola says."
"People naturally resist change, especially when it's imposed on them. Leaders often wait too long to act, and focus on short-term results. This approach fails the fundamental goal of education: to prepare students to succeed over the long term. The first imperative for putting people first is to inspire through purpose."
"Most transformations have financial and operational goals. These are important and they can be energizing to leaders, but they tend not to be very motivating to most people. To motivate more broadly, the transformation needs to connect with a deeper sense of purpose. The second imperative for putting people first is to go all in."
"CEO of Chronos, a global software company, says to win you need to go all in. To enable its people to take that transformation, Chronos invested in new tools that would enable their employees to monitor the usage of the features. The fourth imperative is to instill a culture of continuous learning."
"Inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first, says Steve Ballmer. Ballmer: ""A leader needs to have a vision, a clear road map with milestones, and then you need to be directive"" ""Inclusion is the key to success,"" Ballmer says. ""You have to be able to make a difference in people's lives"""

"JF: The core principle of partner dancing is that one person leads, the other one follows. The physics of movement doesn't really give a crap about your gender, JF says. JF: If we were to update the existing form, we would need to make it more representative of how we interact here in 2015."
"In most mainstream international ballroom competitions, same-sex couples are rarely recognized on the floor. In many cases, the rules prohibit them completely. Even within the white-straight- couple-only paradigm, she can't be taller or shorter."
"""Liquid Lead Dancing"" is a new form of same-sex partner dancing. The idea is to lead and follow each other like a conversation. The dance is called ""liquid lead dancing"" and is performed by Alida and JF. ""Liquid Lead dancing"" is available on YouTube."
"Liquid Lead thinking is a way of thinking that can actually make the dance itself more efficient. The person following can elect to take over the lead, or the person leading can choose to surrender it. With this simple tweak, the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation."
"JF and TC dance with a consciousness that this is a historic form that can produce silence and produce invisibility across the spectrum of identity that we enjoy today. The secret lies in what made Lisa see our initial demonstration as ""political,"" says JF."
"The author's grandfather suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder during the Korean War. The author's mission to help service members who suffered like her grandfather began to take form. ""We invented Liquid Lead as a way of stripping out all the ideas that don't belong to us,"" she says."

"The flexible electronic patch was manufactured using the same processes that they use to build computer chips. The electronics are transferred from a semiconductor wafer onto a flexible material that can interface with the human body. They can measure bodily movement, bodily temperature, electrical rhythms of the body and so forth."
"Researchers have developed a way to embed censors into flexible adhesives. The technology could be used to digitize data and send it to the cloud. It could also be used for wireless transmission, but there are concerns about energy and privacy. The project is being led by Stanford University."
"""We cannot outsmart all the hackers in the world, but perhaps we can present them a smaller target"" ""What we're beginning to do is to have trusted parties serve as intermediaries between people like Jane and her health care providers"" ""We have to remember that there are increasing and widening health disparities"""
"In the U.S. alone, we spent 29.6 billion hours on health care in 2014. We have to be mindful that these human beings have a face and a name. We need to make sure that we are using technology to help those who need it most."
"For decades, our remedy for congestion was simple: build new roads or enlarge existing ones. It worked admirably for Paris, when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings to create 85 miles of transportation-friendly boulevards. It still works today in fast-growing emerging cities. But in more established urban centers, significant network expansions are almost impossible."
"Each of us has 60,000 miles of blood vessels in our bodies. The vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground, on the surface. While our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us, our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional. If our surface grid is saturated, well, let's elevate our traffic."
Up to 30 percent of urban traffic is generated by drivers looking for parking. Building a 3-D transportation network is one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams. The question is: Why are we wasting so much space if it is what we need the most?
"A higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells into massive trains of oxygen. In healthy conditions, more than 95 percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized. ""I think we should transcend this. I think we can create vehicles that combine the convenience of cars and the efficiencies of trains and buses"""
Driverless cars are just trying to earn their way into a traffic grid made by and for humans. But what would happen when whole cities become driverless? Would we need traffic lights? Would there be lanes? How about speed limits? The future of urban traffic is both collective and individual at the same time.
"Driverless cars can drive much faster and can take any rational initiative that can speed them up. Instead of rigid traffic rules, flow will be regulated by a mesh of dynamic and constantly self-improving algorithms. The result: a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of German autobahns and the creative vitality of the intersections of Mumbai."
"Being fat is seen as being a bad person -- lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible and morally suspect. We tend to see thinness as being universally good -- responsible, successful, and in control of our appetites, bodies and lives. This way of thinking is known as fatphobia."
"When she was six years old, a little girl told her mother she didn't need a tutu. ""I was going to sparkle,"" she said. ""That was the first step towards becoming a radical fat person"" Today, she's a successful businesswoman and mother of two."
Reclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous acts of self-love. The common thread through most of this work has been reclaiming spaces that are often prohibitive to bigger bodies. Reclaiming spaces is not only a powerful artistic statement but a radical community-building approach.

There are three reasons why the Middle East has been stable. The first is that the leaders have been able to provide security. The second is that they have the ability to do so. The third is that there is a lack of political will to change.
"Long term, long term, this is going to be a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin. There are real leaders across Asia, they have a lot of political stability. But the leaders in Asia do not feel the need to wave the flag, to allow escalation of geopolitical tensions."
"In a G-Zero world, European expansion will be seen to have gone too far, he says. ""Core Europe around Germany and France and others will still work, be functional, stable, wealthy, integrated"" But the periphery, countries like Greece and Turkey and others, will not look that good at all."
"The US election matters a lot on that one, too. We will see it in Brazil after the impeachment and when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there. For most of the countries in Africa, it's going to be a lot more dicey: extreme climate conditions, radicalism both from Islam and also Christianity."

"Every night, hundreds gathered at the Place de la République to deliberate their own vision of the French Republic. At the core of this adhocracy was a general assembly where anybody could speak using a specially designed sign language. Like Occupy Wall Street and other protest movements, Nuit Debout was born in the face of crisis."
"In the face of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we need a new radical humanism. We must acquire and promote a new aesthetic and sentimental education. We might end up feeling like aliens in organizations and societies that are full of smart machines that have no appreciation whatsoever for the unnecessary."
"Mathematics enables us to do so many things. Tie knots have names. And you can also do the mathematics of tie knots. I want to talk about understanding, and the nature of understanding. And finally, it's about doing cool stuff."
"This is also a pattern. This is also an invented language. Can you guess for what? It is actually a notation system for dancing, for tap dancing. That enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff, to do new things, because he has represented."

"The number system, we use 10 digits. If we change that around and only use two digits, that's called the binary system. We can even write it simply, like 1.3 or 1.6. It all depends on how many digits you have."
The number 4 expresses a relation between two numbers. The number is also a symbol for the number of pixels on a television or computer screen. It is a number that can be viewed from many different perspectives. It can also be viewed as a symbol of the number 4 divided by 3.

""I can even do this with rhythms, right? I can take a rhythm and play three beats at one time"""
"hematically, mathematics is about finding patterns. Four-thirds is a really great number. It's an undervalued number. If you take a sphere and look at the volume of the sphere, it's actually four-thirds of some particular cylinder. You understand something if you have the ability to view it from different perspectives."
"Lecturer: Understanding and changing your perspective are linked. ""If I tell a story from a different point of view, I enable understanding,"" he says. ""I make understanding possible, because you have to generalize over everything you see and hear"""

"Deah, Yusor and Razan were executed in a place that was meant to be safe: their home. For months, this man had been harassing them: knocking on their door, brandishing his gun. His Facebook was cluttered with anti-religion posts. I guess we've all become so numb to the hatred that we couldn't have ever imagined it turning into fatal violence."
"The man who murdered his brother turned himself in to the police shortly after the murders, saying he killed three kids, execution-style, over a parking dispute. The police issued a premature public statement that morning, echoing his claims without bothering to question it or further investigate."

"JH: People don't just disagree in the way that we're familiar with, on the left-right political divide. JH: I think the big issue, especially in Europe but also here, is the issue of immigration. Once something becomes politicized, once it becomes something that the left loves and the right, then even the social scientists can't think straight about it."
"Diversity and immigration do a lot of good things. But ethnic diversity cuts social capital and trust. Scandinavian countries are so wonderful because they have this legacy of being small, homogenous countries. But if, and I was in Sweden this summer, if the discourse in Sweden is fairly politically correct and they can't talk about the downsides."
"CNN's John Sutter says the U.S. is seeing a rise in anti-immigration sentiment. He says the problem is that people see each other as a threat. Sutter: ""If you emphasize our cultural similarity, then race doesn't matter very much"""
Social media has often been framed by techno-optimists as this great connecting force that would bring people together. Social media has come as an unpleasant surprise to a lot of people. People are scared because it feels like this is different than before; it's much more intense.
"The loss of the World War II generation, ""The Greatest Generation,"" is huge. Another, in America, is the purification of the two parties. America had a mid-20th century that was really bipartisan. But because of a variety of factors that started things moving, by the 90's we had a purified liberal party and conservative party."
"The tone of what's happening on the internet now is quite troubling, CA says. JH: The first thing that you have to always keep in mind when you're thinking about politics is that we're tribal. The internet is the most amazing stimulant for post-hoc reasoning and demonization."
"The idea that the world is a battle between good and evil has been ramping up. We're seeing more the urge to keep people off campus, silence them, keep them away. And I think that the opposite of disgust is actually love."
"Love is about dissolving walls, JH says. Americans used to be much more mixed up in the their towns by left-right or politics. Now that it's become this great moral divide, there's a lot of evidence that we're moving to be near people who are like us."

"Blockchain is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer-to-peer network. It's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what. The transactions are secured through cryptography, and over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks."
"Blockchain is an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets. It stores the history of custodianship, ownership and location for assets like the digital currency Bitcoin. It could be a certificate, a contract, real world objects, even personal identifiable information."
"Blockchains allow for us to create an open, global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source. This allows we to create a user-controlled portable identity. Having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way."
"Blockchain is a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly without actually creating that central authority. The last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open-ended, and it's reneging. Blockchains allow us to write code, binding contracts, between individuals and guarantee that those contracts will bear out."
"Bettina Warburg: The technology is in its infancy, and we're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place and probably fail before we truly understand all of the use cases for our economy. Blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange, of exchange of currency, of all kinds of digital and physical assets."
"I don't know is a beautiful thing. Maybe this is what it's like to be on the other side of 25.

"In 1934, 198 doctors, nurses and staff at the Los Angeles County General Hospital became seriously ill. Doctors thought it was a new form of polio. Since then, there have been more than 70 outbreaks documented around the world. All of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women."
"Women are 2 to 10 times more likely to receive a ""hysteria"" diagnosis than men. The problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness is that it can never be proven. The ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice, a choice made by the institutions."
"Since the 1950s, rates of many autoimmune diseases have doubled to tripled. Forty-five percent of patients who are eventually diagnosed with a recognized autoimmune disease are initially told they're hypochondriacs. Even though these diseases disproportionately affect women, they are not women's diseases. ME affects children and ME affects millions of men."
"Many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms. In Germany, scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity, and in Japan, of brain inflammation. In Norway, researchers are running a phase-3 clinical trial on a cancer drug that in some patients causes complete remission."

"The World Economic Forum estimates that women will finally get equal pay in ... 53 years. That leaves us with just a five percent window of opportunity each day to actually think something new. There are 14 run by men called ""Dave"" than there are women. The Equal Pay Act in Britain was passed in 1975."
"The UN chose a woman to be its new ambassador for women's rights. But the number of women in the UK Parliament is far lower than in the U.S. ""We are not going to get equal pay for equal work,"" she says."
"Theresa May, Britain's second female Prime Minister, was challenged to improve lives for women in her first 100 days in office. But she did nothing, she says, because she was too busy cleaning up the mess the boys made. So I knew I had to do ""Deeds, not words,"" she says."

"Police violence against African-Americans and violence against women have been talked about a lot lately. But when we think about who is implicated by these problems, the names of these black women never come to mind. As a consequence, reporters don't lead with them, policymakers don't think about them, and politicians aren't encouraged to speak to them."
"Mike Brown: Many of our social justice problems like racism and sexism are often overlapping. Brown: The experience that gave rise to intersectionality was a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid. He says the judge in question dismissed Emma's suit, and the argument for dismissing the suit was that the employer did hire women."
"Emma Rice's case was thrown out of court because of a framing problem. The frame that the court was using to see gender discrimination or to see race discrimination was partial, and it was distorting. The roads to the intersection would be the way that the workforce was structured by race and by gender."
"Because Emma was both black and female, she was positioned precisely where those roads overlapped. She was experiencing the simultaneous impact of the gender and race traffic. Police violence against black women is very real. The level of violence that black women face is such that it's not surprising that some of them do not survive."
"Roxanne Jones: We need to do more to help the victims of racial violence. Jones: They have been killed when they were alone, and when with others. She asks: Why is it that their stories don't get the same attention? Jones: It's time for a change in the way we talk about the victims."
"CNN's iReport will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. This week, CNN will feature photos of black women in the U.S. and around the world. The gallery will be open to the public, so please share your photos and videos."
"A thousand years ago, three brothers in Baghdad designed a device that was an automated organ. The organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions encoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder. In the 1700s, music-making machines became the playthings of the Parisian elite."
Inventors used paper to make the first programmable loom. The first machines were made in the 17th century in France. The machines were used to make patterns for the first musical instruments. The loom was later adapted to make more complex patterns.
"In 1750, a programmable flute entertaining the Parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time. Sometimes people invent things because they want to stay alive or feed their children. But just as often, new ideas come into the world simply because they're fun."
"The author has asked people all over the world about the dilemma of speaking up. He says each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior. When we step outside that range, we get punished in a variety of ways, he says."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about how power determines a person's range. Sutter: ""Your power determines your range. Your range isn't fixed; it's actually pretty dynamic. It expands and it narrows based on the context"" ""When we lack power, our range narrows,"" Sutter says."
"Women have the same need as men to speak up, but they have barriers to doing so. What looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise. Women have a narrow range, and our double bind is very large. So we need to find ways to expand our range."
"When I feel powerful, I feel confident, not fearful; I expand my own range. When other people see me as powerful, they grant me a wider range. We need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior. Speaking up is risky, but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up."
" perspective-taking is one of the most important tools we have to expand our range. When I take your perspective, and I think about what you really want, you're more likely to give me what I really want. We often get self-focused in a crisis."
"When we take someone's perspective, it allows us to be ambitious and assertive, but still be likable. ""My friend is going to be evicted unless I get him $2,000 immediately,"" he told a bank manager. ""Oh! You don't want to rob the bank -- you want to take out a loan,"" the bank manager said."
"When we advocate for others, we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others, but we also earn strong allies. When we ask others for advice, they like us because we flatter them, and we're expressing humility. And this doesn't just work with salespeople; it works with parents."
"The self-promotion double bind is that if we don't advertise our accomplishments, no one notices, and if we do, we're not likable. Expertise gives us credibility. When we have high power, we already have credibility. We only need good evidence."
"Lizzie Wolf asks people to describe a passion of theirs to her. When we tap into our passion, we give ourselves the courage to speak up, she says. Tapping into passion even works when we come across as too weak, Wolf says."

" CO2 emissions are expected to continue to grow for the next 30 years. The bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries. Each year, about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting added to the planet's atmosphere. That goes a long way towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase in global mean temperatures."
"China has made the choice to run on coal. The United States has an alternative. Eastern Europe, still very heavily committed to natural gas and to coal. China has many fewer choices and a much harder row to hoe. The OECD Europe has a choice. It has renewables."
"In 1980, 80 percent of China's population lived below the extreme poverty level, below the level of having $1.90 per person per day. By the year 2000, only 20 percent of the country lived below that level. The number one killer in China is indoor air pollution, because people do not have access to clean cooking and heating fuels."
"Between one and three one-gigawatt coal plants are being turned on around the world. Every 100 of those plants will use up between one percent and three percent of the Earth's climate budget. The people that rule their countries, assessing the interests of their citizens, have decided it's in their interests to do that."
New nuclear plants are on the drawing boards around the world. They say they can deliver power for 5 cents a kilowatt hour. The second alternative that could be there in time is utility-scale solar backed up with natural gas. Outdated regulations and yesterday's mindsets are holding new nuclear back.
"Six of the 10 worst impacted nations by climate change are on the continent of Africa. People are reeling from all sorts of unnatural disasters, leaving them without a chance at making a decent living. Despite these challenges, what we're seeing is that there's a network of Africans all across the continent who are rising up."

The number of satellites in orbit is growing. Satellites in low Earth orbit are expected to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. High Earth orbit is expected to remain in orbit for a long time. There are no plans to remove all the satellites in low orbit.
"There's speculation that Nepal will crack down on mountaineers with stricter enforcement of penalties and legal obligations. Neither of these guidelines is binding under international law, and the understanding is that they will be implemented through national mechanisms. What if there actually were international laws with teeth that enforced end-of-life disposal of satellites?"
"There are some encouraging signs that technology can be used to fix satellites. The idea of using a robotic arm to fix a satellite is a good one. But there are other ways to fix the satellites, such as by using nets or other technology."
"CNN's John Defterios: Earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful and our gateway to exploration. But these satellites that we rely on day in and day out have a finite life. They might run out of propellant, they could malfunction, or they may just naturally reach the end of their mission life. Together we must reduce our impact."

CNN's Kristie Luiz Navarrette learned three lessons from midwifery. Delivering babies taught her how to start a car at 2am and how to stay open when things get difficult or painful. She also learned that under surface time is a whole other dimension where the past and the present and the future merge.

"Sister's bone marrow transplant is fraught with danger. Sister and I had a long history of love, but also of rejection and attack. We were hesitant to tell our truths, to reveal our wounds, to admit our wrongdoings. What if we faced any pain we had caused each other, and could we listen?"
"CNN.com's John Sutter underwent a bone marrow transplant. Sutter: ""I called on those midwife lessons: uncover your soul"" ""I have never forgiven him for that thing I made up in my head,"" Sutter says of his ex-husband."

Parents tell stories of longing for a child and a quest for that child. Parents fear their children might disapprove and reject the non-genetic parent. Research shows that these children are doing fine and do not have more problems than other kids.
"Researchers: Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father?"" The father of a donor-conceived boy says his son's outburst had nothing to do with the lack of a genetic link. ""It's what they do at that age. It will pass,"" he says."

It is time for religious leaders and religious communities to take the lead in the spiritual and cultural shift that this country desperately needs."
"Time is highly elastic. We cannot make more time, but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it. The key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater. It's just not their fault. Of course, right?"

"There are 168 hours in a week. Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours. That is a lot of time. If you are working a full-time job, so 40 hours a week, sleeping eight hours a night, that leaves 72 hours for other things."
"In 168 hours a week, we can find time for what matters to us. We don't even need that much time to do amazing things. But when most of us have bits of time, what do we do? Pull out the phone, right?"
"Writer: Even if we are busy, we have time for what matters. Breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying. DVR your favorite shows so you can fast-forward through the commercials, he says. Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right? He says."
"About 1,800 of these weapons are on high alert, which means they can be launched within 15 minutes of a presidential command. ""I know this is a bummer of an issue, and maybe you have that -- what was it? -- psychic fatigue that we heard about a little bit earlier,"" says CNN's John Sutter."
"Nuclear weapons are vulnerable. We have solid evidence that terrorists are trying to get ahold of them. An amount of highly enriched uranium about the size of your morning latte would be enough to kill 100,000 people instantly. Most of the world's nuclear nations have committed to getting rid of these weapons."
"The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons sets no specific date by which the world's nuclear-armed nations will get rid of their nuclear weapons. John F. Kennedy gave us a challenge that would have been incredible just a few years earlier. With that challenge, he inspired scientists and marketers, astronauts and schoolteachers."
2045 is the 100th anniversary of the creation of nuclear weapons. David Frum says it's a good time to think about the future. He says the world needs a new way of thinking about how to use technology. Frum: We need a new generation of innovators who are willing to take risks.
"Nuclear weapons should be ended on the 100th anniversary of its inception. It has to be about strategies for mutually assured prosperity or, at the very least, mutually assured survival. By 2045, we will have held billions of people hostage to the threat of nuclear annihilation."
"CNN's John Defterios speaks at a summit on nuclear disarmament. He says nuclear weapons represent a greater global threat to Jasmine's generation than a promise. ""It's time we make a promise of a world in which we've broken the stranglehold that nuclear weapons have on our imaginations,"" he says."
"The most successful companies in the world are often the ones with the least success. That's the way it is in business, and that's how it's going to be in the future, too. The world is going to have to get used to the idea that there is no such thing as a perfect company."
"The more people share their knowledge, the better they do on every metric. Givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people and improve the team. Takers tend to rise quickly but also fall quickly in most jobs. And they fall at the hands of matchers."
"In every job, in every organization I've ever studied, the best results belong to the givers again. Givers are overrepresented at the bottom and at the top of every success metric that I can track. Paranoia is caused by people that I call ""takers"""
"The five-minute favor is critical to helping givers set boundaries and protect themselves. The second thing that matters if you want to build a culture where givers succeed, is a culture of help-seeking. ""You don't have to be Mother Teresa or Gandhi to be a giver,"" says Adam Rifkin."
"Help-seeking isn't just important for protecting the success and the well-being of givers. Data say that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent of all giving in organizations starts with a request. But a lot of people don't ask. They don't want to look incompetent, they don't know where to turn."
"Hiring and screening and team building is not about bringing in the givers; it's about weeding out the takers. We're actually pretty bad at figuring out who's a taker, especially on first impressions. The givers will be generous because they don't have to worry about the consequences."
"The difference between agreeable and disagreeable people can be seen in their behavior. The more giving you are, the more likely it is that you will make a difference to someone else's life. The most giving people are often the ones who make the most difference."
"The most common type of taker is someone who is nice to your face, then stabs you in the back. The most meaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed, says the author. ""If we can make it safe to ask for help, we can actually turn that belief upside down"""
"The author surveyed over 30,000 people across industries around the world. She found that most people are right in the middle between giving and taking. ""I want to live in a world where givers succeed, and I hope you will help me create that world,"" she says."
"In a survey of over 500 adults, most responded with ""belly"" or ""round"" and ""cute"" When we label an adult as cute, we take away a lot of their intelligence, their complexity. We're actually told that women have two roles, but these two roles have a difficult time existing."
"The Venus of Willendorf, a Paleolithic figurine, was thought to be a goddess of love and beauty. The theory was later revised, though, when scholars noted the sculptor's obvious focus on the figurine's reproductive features. The figurine had large breasts, considered ideal for nursing, and a round, possibly pregnant belly."
CNN's John Sutter asks: Have you ever been told what you can and can't do by someone you don't know? Sutter also asks: Has anyone ever been asked if they want to have sex with someone who isn't their partner?
"Doctors don't tell women it's safe to have sex during pregnancy. Women are denied basic privacy and bodily autonomy under the guise of ""be a good mother"" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has no official statement on the issue."
"Pregnant women are not faceless, identity-less vessels of reproduction. Some women don't want to have sex during pregnancy, and that's OK. A woman who prioritizes her sexual needs is scary, because we can't make room for her at the table of power."
"Don't tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies. Don't tell them how to have sex. If you're having sex with a woman, don't tell her what to do with her body. When it comes to sex, women should be able to have as much as they want."
CNN's John Sutter challenges viewers to disrupt patterns of inequality. Sutter: How many of you have seen an advertisement that uses a woman's breast to sell an entirely unrelated product? Sutter asks if you support comprehensive sex education that doesn't shame our teenagers.
"Cheryl was the nutrition director at High School in the Community in Connecticut. She cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure she cooked something she knew her children would eat.

"In New York City, 474,000 kids under the age of 18 face hunger every year. 16 million children -- almost 20 percent -- are food insecure. Research shows that kids who do not have consistent nourishment, particularly at breakfast, have poor cognitive function."
"A third of the kids that we've been talking about tonight are on track to have diabetes in their lifetime.

"Linguists suggest a new metaphor for love: love as a collaborative work of art. Love is unpredictable, love requires communication and discipline, says author. ""Love involves both joy and pain,"" she says. ""It's not just about being in love, it's about being part of it"""
"When 14-year-old Juliet first meets Romeo, she does not feel disappointed or angsty. Reframing love as something I get to create with someone I admire is empowering. This version of love is not about winning or losing someone's affection. Instead, it requires that you trust your partner."

"In the days before computers, people used to do calculations by hand. In the 1970s and 1980s, people started using computers to do their own calculations. This led to the development of the computer program called VisiCalc. The program is now used to help people with math problems."
Brian Greene developed VisiCalc in the early 1980s. The program is now used by millions of people worldwide. Greene: Visi Calc is a way to find solutions to problems in an electronic spreadsheet. He says the program can also be used to help people with math problems.
"The first version of the BASIC computer program was developed in the 1970s. It was developed with the help of a friend. The program is still in use today, almost 40 years after it was first developed. It allows users to enter numbers, letters and numbers into a computer."

"We are so invested in the personal narrative that we forget to look at the bigger picture. The most important stories, especially for social justice, are those that are both personal and allow us to explore and understand the political. Increasingly, we are living in a society where there are larger forces at play, where stories are actually for many people beginning to replace the news."

"""Different Kinds of Air: A Plant's Diary"" is on display at the Museum of Natural History in New York. The exhibition is a look at the history of air and how it has changed over time. The air in the exhibit is made up of different types of gases, including carbon dioxide."
"The air of the Great Dying was 252.5 million years ago, just before the dinosaurs evolve. This is the greatest extinction event in Earth's history, even bigger than when the dinosaurs died out. ""It's really calming, it's quite warm and it has a flavor a little bit like soda water"""
"The air will be part of the air for the next 300 to 400 years, before it's broken down. Its warming potential is 24,000 times that of carbon dioxide. Humans made this air, but it's also the most potent greenhouse gas that has been tested."
"Like air, climate change is simultaneously at the scale of the molecule, the breath and the planet. It's immediate, vital and intimate, as well as being amorphous and cumbersome. Even though it's invisible, humans are leaving a very vibrant trace in the air."
"Students wanted a place for cultural exchange. They thought a fireplace could draw people in and help start conversations. And everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world. There really wasn't a precedent for this kind of space, so we looked around the globe."
"It's made of cordwood masonry, which is using logs the way you would use bricks. We chose the building method because it connects people to each other. And it's good for the planet, too: the trees absorbed carbon when they were growing up."
"Tall buildings don't necessarily lend themselves to being social buildings. The shapes of the floor slabs vary slightly and they transition as you go up the tower. The result of this is that you can actually see people from your balcony. And besides, skylines are highly specific urban habitats with their own insects."
"Camille Martínez: Public architecture is just not as successful if it comes from the top down. He says tall buildings can be social connectors, but what about public architecture? Marti: How can we create better social cohesion in public buildings?"
"""Polis Station"" is based on the idea that if you can increase opportunities for positive social interactions between police and community members, you can rebuild that relationship and activate the neighborhood. Instead of the police station as a scary fortress, you get highly active spaces on the public side of the station."
The North Lawndale Police Station has been transformed into a community center. It's the first time the police station has been open to the public for more than a year. The station is also a place for the public to meet the police officers.
Architects are relationship builders. We can reduce the stress and the polarization in our urban habitats. Less than one percent of Earth's freshwater supply is available for human consumption. Lack of access to clean water is a leading cause of death in children under the age of five.
"In developing countries, something called solar disinfection is used to purify water. In order to make the SODIS process faster, this new method called photocatalysis has recently been used. The UV radiation from the sun destroys the DNA of harmful pathogens and decontaminates the water."
"The composite combines titanium dioxide with cement. The cement-like composite can be formed into several different shapes, which results in an extremely versatile range of deployment methods.

"The U.S. has put four rovers on Mars since the mid-1990s. The rovers are our robotic emissaries. They are our eyes and our ears, and they see the planet for us until we can send people."
"It takes Mars 24 hours and approximately 40 minutes to rotate once. That means that the Martian day is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day. In order to come to work on the Earth at the same time every day on Mars, the team needs to be at work at 5:00 p.m."
"Writer: ""We didn't start out thinking that we were going to need Mars watches"" ""We got just instantaneously confused about what time it was,"" he says. ""We started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to each other"""
"The blinds went down all over the building about a week before landing, and they didn't go up until we went off Mars time. The people who work on the landed missions that don't rove around, they say ""tosoul"" So I could actually tell what mission you worked on from your Martian accent."
"The impact on families was just across the board. It wasn't just those of us who were working on the rovers but our families as well. One flight director's family lived on Mars time for a month and had these great adventures, like going bowling in the middle of the night or going to the beach."
"When you're moving a time-zone every day, you start to really feel separated from everyone else. We don't stay on Mars time for more than three to four months. Eventually, we'll move to a modified Mars time, which is what we're working now."

"All of us are needed here. Just imagine all the suffering we could alleviate if we dared to face this issue together. I became very ill, drifting in and out of consciousness in between spasms of convulsive vomiting. The security guards wanted to call me an ambulance, but Tom acted as my knight in shining armor. It was like a fairy tale, his strong arms around me, laying me in the safety of my bed."
"The writer was raped by a man in Iceland when she was 17 years old. The only thing that could've stopped her from being raped was if the man had stopped himself, she says. The word ""rape"" didn't echo around her mind as it should've, and she wasn't crucifying herself with memories."
"Tom was a surfer, a social science student, a friend to good people, a loved brother and son, an outdoor recreation guide, and eventually, a youth worker. His self-worth was buried under a soul-crushing load of silence that isolated him from everyone that he cared about, and he was consumed with misplaced hatred and anger."
"""I want to find forgiveness"" stared back at me, surprising nobody more than myself. I realized that this was my way out of my suffering, because regardless of whether or not he deserved my forgiveness, I deserved peace. The only outcome that I didn't prepare myself for was the one that I then got -- a typed confession from Tom, full of disarming regret."
"Cape Town proved to be a stunningly powerful environment to focus on reconciliation and forgiveness. There were gutting confessions, and moments where we just couldn't fathom the other person's experience. The seismic effects of sexual violence were spoken aloud and felt, face to face."
"The author of a book about rape and its aftermath, writes about her own experience. She says she and her husband, who is also a rape victim, have been through a difficult time. The book is about how to deal with the trauma of being a victim of rape."

"Many of us spend most of our time in the performance zone. This hinders our growth, and ironically, also our performance. So what does the learning zone look like? Let's find out in this week's episode of ""This is Life with Maria"""
"Dr. Anders Ericsson calls deliberate practice. It involves breaking down abilities into component skills. The best chess players spend a lot of time not playing games of chess, which would be their performance zone, but trying to predict the moves grand masters made."
We need to focus on what we can learn from our mistakes. We need to learn how to make mistakes and learn from them. We must learn to learn to be more self-confident and less self-conscious. We should learn to accept our mistakes and to learn from those mistakes.
"We must be in a low-stakes situation to make mistakes. We must have an idea about how to improve, not how I used to practice the guitar as a teenager, but doing deliberate practice. We can create more spaces for growth by starting conversations about when we want to be in each zone."
"We can create low-stakes islands in an otherwise high-stakes sea. These are spaces where mistakes have little consequence. The observation, reflection and adjustment is a learning zone. We can lead and lower the stakes for others by sharing what we want to get better at."
"Many cancer diagnostic tools are invasive, costly, often inaccurate and can take an agonizing amount of time to get the results back. Good screening methods simply don't exist, meaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface. An early warning would allow us to get out ahead of the disease instead of merely following in its relentless wake."
"Cancer researchers are working on ways to make regular screening for many types of cancers much more accessible. The silver bullet in this case are tiny vesicles, little escape pods regularly shed by cells called exosomes. Exosomes are important biomarkers that provide an early-warning system for the development of cancer."
"Exosomes contain surface receptors, proteins and other genetic material collected from their cell of origin. When absorbed by a neighboring cell, exosomes release their contents into the receiving cell, and can set in motion fundamental changes in gene expression. Currently, no automated exosome isolation system exists to make regular screening economically accessible."
"Cancer is emotionally draining and, for many, financially destructive. The idea here is that the separation process for screening could be as simple as processing a sample of urine, blood or saliva. Ultimately, it could be used to isolate and detect target exosomes associated with a particular type of cancer."
"CNN's John Defterios is working on a technology that could place an early-warning cancer detection system in every home. Finding cancer early greatly enhances your odds of survival, he says. ""I'm also happy to report that because we caught my wife's cancer early, her treatment was successful, and she is now, thankfully, cancer-free"""
"""Syria Deeply"" was designed to be a news and information source that made it easier to understand a complex issue. For the past four years, it's been a resource for policymakers and professionals working on the conflict in Syria. ""We built a business model based on consistent, high-quality information, and convening the top minds on the issue"""
"Journalists need to work with local journalists, not just fixers, says John Defterios. Local reporters in Syria and across Africa and Asia bring us stories that we certainly would not have found on our own, he says. We need a kind of Hippocratic oath for the news industry, a pledge to first do no harm, he adds."

"Life in a society where there are no social institutions is riddled with danger and uncertainty. Questions about security, when you don't have any security systems, are terrifying. Health concerns when there is no health system are also terrifying. You wake up one morning, and you discover that the reason there areno rules is because there's no government."
"Kosovo's lack of social systems is difficult to explain to people outside of the country. The most dangerous time to be a person living in a conflict-affected state is after the cessation of hostilities. War kills people by robbing them of their clinics, of their hospitals and of their supply chains."
"Doctors Without Borders is an organization designed to provide emergency care in war zones. Liberia's civil war had ended in 2003 -- that was 11 years before Ebola even struck. When Ebola struck Liberia, there were less than 50 doctors in the entire country of 4.5 million people."

"Litter is blending into the background of our lives, but what if we brought it to the forefront? What if we understood exactly what was on our streets, our sidewalks and our school yards? How might we use that data to make a difference? Well, let me show you."
"Every city in the world has a unique litter fingerprint, and that fingerprint provides both the source of the problem and the path to the solution. Data was used in court to not only defend but double the tax, generating an annual recurring revenue of four million dollars for San Francisco to clean itself up."
"A group of fifth graders picked up 1,247 pieces of litter just on their school yard. They learned that the most common type of litter were the plastic straw wrappers from their own cafeteria. The vision is to create a litter-free world."
"When he was a child, Mark O'Mara joined Westboro Baptist Church's picket line. He then turned his attention to social media, and started posting photos of litter on Twitter. He noticed that the photos became artistic and approachable, and that people started participating."

"CNN's John Sutter writes about how to respond to people who disagree with him. Sutter: ""The impulse to respond in kind is so tempting, but that isn't who we want to be"" ""I will always be inspired by those people I encountered on Twitter, apparent enemies who became my friends"""
"When we engage people across ideological divides, asking questions helps us map the disconnect. We can't present effective arguments if we don't understand where the other side is coming from. The third is to stay calm. This takes practice and patience, but it's powerful."
"The author's husband would often change the subject during heated online conversations. He would tell a joke or recommend a book or gently excuse himself from the conversation.

"Computer vision uses machine learning techniques to do facial recognition. Over time, you can teach a computer how to recognize other faces. But if the training sets aren't really that diverse, any face that deviates too much from the established norm will be harder to detect."
"One in two adults in the US -- that's 117 million people -- have their faces in facial recognition networks. Police departments can currently look at these networks unregulated, using algorithms that have not been audited for accuracy. Algorithmic bias, like human bias, results in unfairness.

The funeral industry promotes the idea of human exceptionalism. It ignores the fact that death can be an emotionally messy and complex affair. Having your body laid out to be eaten by animals is not for everyone. We have to be able to create and practice this ritual without harming the environment.
"CNN's John Sutter looks at ways to preserve the body of the dead.

"The Jedi have a head appendage issue. Wookiees also have an accessory issue. What would you do if you suddenly found there was a Wookiee under there, or possibly two Ewoks? Well, in the kit there's actually a razor, and we can use that to shave the chest."
"The electricity travels across the surface instead of through the heart. The preferred method is 30 compressions and two breaths in the center of the chest, between the nipples. After the shock, one of the things we need to do is remember to do compression. The mere mention of the word ""nipples,"" and people get into a little bit of a tizzy."
"An AED is an automated external defillator. It's the device you use when your heart goes into cardiac arrest to shock it back into a normal rhythm. The way of remembering the compression-only part is we can actually use the Imperial March. If you do find yourself dealing with a Wookiee, do not do the whole thing. This takes way too much time and only pisses them off."
"AEDs can drastically increase your chance of survival -- almost like a tauntaun on Hoth. The Jedi, on the other hand, have no problems with their outfits. But I really can't blame the Empire, since health and safety regulations aren't really their first order of business."
"The women said they would rather deliver on a floor than on a plastic sheet that smeared blood all over. The thread provided was a highway to bacterial infection through the baby's umbilical cord.

"Gender is not an easy conversation to have. Many men do not actively think about gender or notice gender is part of the problem of gender. Some people will bring up evolutionary biology and apes, how female apes bow down to male apes. But the point is we're not apes."
"Gender and class are different forms of oppression. Men and women experience the world differently. But we can change that. Some people will say, ""Oh, but women have the real power, bottom power"" But bottom power is not power at all. Bottom power means that a woman simply has a good root to tap into."

"Men and women are different. We have different hormones, we have different sexual organs. Women can have babies, men can't. There's slightly more women than men in the world, about 52 percent of the world's population. But most of the positions of power and prestige are occupied by men."
"In Lagos I cannot go alone into many ""reputable"" bars and clubs. They just don't let you in if you're a woman alone, you have to be accompanied by a man.

"The crisis began when an emergency manager, appointed by Michigan's governor, decided to switch their water source to a local river. People like Michelle Obama, Malala and others lent their voices in protest. The water quality is slowly improving and the pipes are being replaced."
"In collaboration with Flint residents, Tech conducted citywide testing to prove that Flint's water was contaminated, even toxic in some homes. The state of Michigan was forced to acknowledge the problem and take steps to correct it. The arrogance and the callous disregard for public health shown by scientists and engineers is beyond belief."
"In the 1930s, an engineer named Peter Palchinsky criticized the Soviet Union. He said the engineers were too focused on making money, not on the people. He was executed for his role in the Great Depression. Today, he says, engineers should be more focused on the public good."
The Flint water crisis is one of the most egregious environmental injustices of our time. The markers of empathy in our college graduates have been dropping dramatically in the past two decades. These are not the ideals we would want to pass to our students.
"""Heroic Imagination Project"" aims to train young people to be heroes in the real world. The project is inspired by the tragedy of Flint, Michigan, and the need to help the city's residents. ""We are trained to build bridges and solve problems, but not to think or live as a citizen"""
"Flint's water infrastructure -- the complex network of underground pipes -- has been severely damaged. The first time I heard ""mental health,"" I was a boarding school student fresh off the boat from Ghana. Like Okonkwo in ""Things Fall Apart,"" we African men neither process nor express our emotions. We deal with our problems."
"Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being. 75 percent of all mental illness cases can be found in low-income countries. Most African governments invest less than one percent of their health care budget in mental health. Even worse, we have a severe shortage of psychiatrists in Africa."
"In all of Africa, 90 percent of our people lack access to treatment. The stigmatization against mental illness often results in the ostracizing and demonizing of sufferers. Photojournalist Robin Hammond has documented some of these abuses in Uganda, in Somalia, and here in Nigeria."
"When it comes to mental illness, our ignorance eviscerates all empathy. We must stop stigmatizing disease and traumatizing the afflicted. All of us -- but we Africans especially -- need to realize that our mental struggles do not detract from our virility, nor does our trauma taint our strength."
"Sangu says he felt suffocated by the rigid architecture of our African masculinity. Being honest about how we feel does not make us weak; it makes us human, he says. It is time to end the stigma associated with mental illness, he adds."
"A second core source of power is wealth. Money creates the ability to buy results and to buy almost any other kind of power. The third form of power, government, is the use of law and bureaucracy to compel people to do or not do certain things. The fourth type of power are social norms or what other people think is okay."
"Power is something we are often uncomfortable talking about. There are three laws of power worth examining. Power begets more power, and so does powerlessness. The only thing that keeps law number three from leading to a situation where only one person has all the power is how we apply laws one and two."
"In a democracy, power is supposed to reside with the people. To read power means to pay attention to as many texts of power as you can. In this case, that means understanding who has the power and who doesn't. In the end, it's the people who have the power."
"Citizenship is all about how to use your civic power. Read so you may write. Study the strategies others in such situations used: frontal attack or indirection, coalitions or charismatic authority. Practice consensus building. Set objectives, then bigger ones."
"Power is the ability to make others do what you would have them do. It governs how any form of government works. Learning how power operates is key to being effective, being taken seriously, and not being taken advantage of. There are six main sources of civic power: physical force and a capacity for violence."
"Elephants have an incredible memory and ability to solve problems. They also have a strong sense of social justice. They have a unique way of communicating with each other and other animals. They are also very social, and often help each other out."
"It's a common saying that elephants never forget, but these magnificent animals are more than giant walking hard drives. Elephants know every member in their herd, able to recognize as many as 30 companions by sight or smell. The elephant boasts the largest brain of any land mammal, as well as an impressive encephalization quotient."
"Memory consolidation is the process by which information is moved from short-term to long-term memory. It occurs with the help of a major part of the brain, known as the hippocampus. The role of the hippocampus in memory formation was demonstrated in the 1950s by Brenda Milner."
"Sleep occupies nearly  a third of our lives, but many of us give surprisingly little attention and care to it. Sleep isn't lost time, or just a way to rest when all our important work is done. Instead, it's a critical function, during which your body balances and regulates its vital systems."
"In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed that light could, in fact, be a particle. The idea was derided for years to come, but Einstein was simply twenty years ahead of his time. The theory would pave the way for technologies, ranging from particle accelerators, to the global positioning system."
Einstein's theory of relativity was first published in 1905. He would go on to publish three more papers on the same subject. His theory was the basis for the famous equation E=MC2. He died in 1916 at the age of 77.
"The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one of five plastic-filled gyres in the world's seas. The pollutants turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup. Some animals, like seabirds, get entangled in the mess. They, and others, mistake the brightly colored plastic bits for food."
Three plastic bottles were used to make millions of pounds of plastic. The plastic is then used to create the plastic used in the plastic bottles. The bottles are then used as part of the plastic production process. The plastics are used to build the plastic into the plastic bottle.
"The term ""Orwellian"" is often used to refer to an oppressive government. But it can also be used to describe the way we use language to make a point, says Andrew Keen. Keen says we need to be aware of the power of our language to shape our thinking."
"The government of ""1984""'s Oceania controls its people's actions and speech in some ways that are obvious. The population is inundated  with a constant barrage of propaganda made up of historical facts and statistics. But accidents can and will still happen, and when they do, their outcomes may be determined months or years in advance."
"Self-driving cars are predicted to dramatically reduce traffic accidents and fatalities by removing human error from the driving equation. What happens if the cars start analyzing and factoring in the passengers of the cars and the particulars of their lives? This is a thought experiment. Reality may not play out exactly like our thought experiments, but that's not the point."
 melanin is a type of skin pigment that protects cells from UV damage. Melanoma is a deadly cancer that forms in the skin's melanocytes. The type and amount of melanin in your skin determines whether you'll be more or less protected from the sun.
" melanin is the pigment that gives skin and hair its color. It comes from skin cells called melanocytes and takes two basic forms. There's eumelanin, which gives rise to a range of brown skin tones, as well as black, brown, and blond hair. And there's pheomelan in, which causes the reddish browns of freckles and red hair."
"The dancer's elevated leg straightens and moves from the front to the side, before it folds back into her knee. By staying in motion, that leg is storing some of the momentum of the turn. When the leg comes back in towards the body, that stored momentum gets transferred back to the dancer's body."
"In Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake,"" the Black Swan pulls off a seemingly endless series of turns. The spectacular turns are called fouettés, which means ""whipped"" in French. A skilled dancer will be able to keep her turning axis vertical."
"Vivaldi's ""Winter"" concerto is some of the most familiar of all early 18th century music. Unlike his contemporary Bach, Vivaldi wasn't much interested in complicated fugues. Vivaldi's music served  as diversion for all, not just for wealthy aristocrats."
"Antonio Vivaldi's ""The Four Seasons"" were published in Amsterdam in 1725. They were accompanied by poems describing exactly what Vivaldi intended to capture. Vivaldi was generations ahead of his time in providing specific plot content for instrumental music."
Songs are a form of communication between marine mammals. They are often used to communicate with each other. They can also be used as a way to communicate between different species. The songs are often repeated over and over again by the same animals.
Baleen whales have one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. Some whales will avoid key feeding or breeding grounds if human noise is too loud. Limiting human activity along migratory routes and in other critical habitats would help ensure  whales continued survival.
"People are more likely than women to say it's okay to push the man over the bridge. One explanation is that pushing someone to their death feels more personal, but we feel conflicted because we know it's still the logical choice. Researchers have studied the brain activity of people thinking through the classic and bridge versions."
New technology is making this kind of ethical analysis more important than ever. Driver-less cars may have to handle choices like causing a small accident to prevent a larger one. Governments are researching autonomous military drones that could wind up making decisions of whether they'll risk civilian casualties to attack a high-value target.

"David Irving: Deborah Lipstadt libeled me when she called me a Holocaust denier. That meant if I didn't fight, he would win by default. So we fought. And for those of you who haven't seen ""Denial,"" spoiler alert: we won."

"CNN's John Sutter asks: What can we do when someone makes an outrageous claim? Sutter: We must not treat it as if their lies are the same as the facts. ""There are certain things that are true,"" Sutter says. ""We have to look for them"""
"The Earth is not flat. The climate is changing. Elvis is not alive. Truth and fact are under assault. The perpetrators are the people who say, ""We did it. I did it."" The point of connection, this space circled in red, is called the synapse."
"The molecular causes of Alzheimer's are still debated. Most neuroscientists believe that the disease begins when amyloid beta begins to accumulate. Too much is released, or not enough is cleared away, and the synapse begins to pile up."
"Scientists are betting big on the simplest solution: keep amyloid plaques from reaching that tipping point. By mid-stage Alzheimer's, we have massive inflammation and tangles and all-out war at the synapse and cell death. So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be a preventative medicine."
"The way we live can influence the accumulation of amyloid plaques. We've all inherited our genes from our moms and our dads. Some of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it. If you're like Alice in ""Still Alice,"" you've inherited a rare genetic mutation."
"Scientists believe that poor sleep hygiene might actually be a predictor of Alzheimer's. A single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in amyloid beta. High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, have all been shown to increase our risk."
Aerobic exercise has been shown in many studies to decrease amyloid beta in animal models of the disease. Some autopsy studies have shown that as many as 80 percent of people with Alzheimer's also had cardiovascular disease. So a heart-healthy Mediterranean lifestyle and diet can help to counter the tipping of this scale.
"In the Nun Study, 678 nuns, all over the age of 75, were followed for more than two decades. Despite the presence of plaques and tangles and brain shrinkage, the nuns who had belonged to these brains showed no signs of having the disease while they were alive. Scientists think it's because these nuns had a high level of cognitive reserve."
"If you have Alzheimer's, three of your synapses are damaged or destroyed. Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain means learning to speak Italian, meeting new friends, reading a book, or listening to a great TED Talk. You don't want to simply retrieve information you've already learned. You want to pave new neural roads."
Alzheimer's doesn't mean you're dying tomorrow. Diagnosis doesn't have to be. Keep living. You won't lose your emotional memory. You'll still be able to understand love and joy. And you are more than what you can remember.
" autonomy system is likely to at least mitigate the crash, except in rare circumstances. Once you get literally safe hands-off driving, the power to disrupt the whole industry seems massive. The key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy need to be than a person before you can rely on it?"

"Under 100 percent sea ice in the dead of winter, bowhead whales are singing. Sound transmits very well underwater, much better than it does in air, so signals can be heard over great distances. Arctic marine mammals have to hear each other, and they also have to listen for cues in the environment."
Climate change and decreases in sea ice are also altering the underwater soundscape of the Arctic. The sounds are inaudible above water depending on where you are and the time of year. But the underwaterSoundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or rainforest.
" Decreases in sea ice have allowed humans to occupy the Arctic more often. With less seasonal sea ice, subarctic species are moving north. The number of storms and the intensity of storms in the Arctic has been increasing. All of this is raising noise levels in a previously quiet ocean."
"Arctic marine mammals are used to very high levels of noise at certain times of the year. They use sound to study their habitat, to keep in communication with each other, to navigate, to detect predators and prey. Air guns, which produce loud, low-frequency ""whoomps"" every 10 to 20 seconds, changed the swimming and vocal behavior of whales."
"The Arctic embodies this disconnect between what we see on the surface and what's going on underwater. The future ""you"" has to be like an aging movie star who has been made to believe that there is a possibility of a world which is completely, wholly, self-obsessively in love with itself."

"Everything I said took a new meaning. Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly -- was there for the world to comment upon and judge. I started to feel that I could not be who I wanted to be or say what I actually thought. humanity at this time completely identified with me."
"I invented a new dance form which I didn't realize, and it became a rage. I even tried to get into a skintight superhero suit to reinvent myself. I must admit I failed miserably. I'm quite shameless, I'll show you."
"""I thought if I put on philosophical tweets out there people will think I'm with it, but some of the responses I got from those tweets were extremely confusing acronyms which I didn't understand,"" he says.

"The future ""you"" has to be a you that loves, says the Dalai Lama. ""You can use your energy to build nuclear bombs and spread the darkness of destruction,"" he says. ""Or you can use it to spread the joy of light to millions"""
"The future ""you"" is an infinite you, says Stuart Bell. A you that perceives time and space differently understands both your unimaginable and fantastic importance and your complete unimportance in the larger context of the universe. Bell: I think this could be, as some people have described it, the biggest event in human history."
"The problem of creating something more intelligent than your own species is called ""the gorilla problem"" ""We had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire,"" Norbert Wiener said in 1960. ""I actually want to be able to keep doing AI,"" says Lee Sedol, an AI researcher."
"AI is progressing a lot faster than we expected. Putting in the wrong objective is not the only part of the problem. If you put an objective into a machine, even something as simple as, ""Fetch the coffee,"" the machine says to itself, ""Well, how might I fail to fetch the coffee?"""
"I'm trying to redefine AI to get away from this classical notion of machines that intelligently pursue objectives. There are three principles involved. The first is a principle of altruism, if you like, that the robot's only objective is to maximize the realization of human objectives, of human values. The second law is a law of humility. The third law is that it doesn't know what those human values are."
"Turing: ""Can you switch the machine off?"" as Turing suggested. The question is: Is it going to let you switch it off? If we do it the classical way, we give it the objective of, ""Fetch the coffee, I must fetch the coffee,"" so obviously the PR2 has been listening to my talk."
Human-compatible AI is the first step in what we're trying to do with human- compatible AI. Just because you behave badly doesn't mean the robot is going to copy your behavior. It's going to understand your motivations and maybe help you resist them if appropriate.
"AI is not designed just to satisfy the desires of one person, the user, but in fact it has to respect the preferences of everybody. It can deal with a certain amount of nastiness, for example, you may take bribes as a passport official because you need to feed your family and send your kids to school."

"Scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades. As more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean, the seawater pH has gone down, which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity. The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet."
"There has already been an increase in ocean acidity of 26 percent since pre-industrial times, which is directly due to human activities. Unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions, we're expecting an increase of 170 percent by the end of this century. This rate of acidification is 10 times faster than any acidification in our oceans for over 55 million years."
"As ocean acidity increases, the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease. These ions are basically the building blocks for many marine species to make their shells. And at even even lower levels, they can actually begin to dissolve. So ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain."
"By the end of this century, 70 percent of all known cold-water corals in the entire ocean will be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure. The only way of doing that is by reducing our carbon dioxide emissions."
"Oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide that we have emitted. As more carbon dioxide enters the ocean, the seawater pH goes down. Only about one in 10 gets the eight to 10 hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists."
"Around the time of puberty, teenagers experience a delay in their biological clock. This is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin. Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around 11pm. This means that waking a teenager up at 6am is the biological equivalent of waking an adult."
"Sleep-deprived teens are 55 percent more likely to have used alcohol in the past month. For each hour of lost sleep, there is a 38 percent increase in feeling sad or hopeless. Teens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk for a host of physical health problems."
"Schools around the country should start middle and high schools no earlier than 8:30am, author says. ""Why should we delay start times for teenagers? We need to toughen them up so they're ready for the real world,"" he asks. ""Think about the tremendous power of sleep,"" he says."
"Climate change is a global problem, but the U.S. is stuck in a partisan divide, he says. He says the road to climate progress in the United States runs through the Republican Party and the business community. ""We are fundamentally stuck, and that is why we need a killer app of climate policy"""
Republican leaders put forth a concrete market-based climate solution. Almost every leading editorial board in the country has since endorsed our plan. Fortune 100 companies from a wide range of industries are now getting behind it. The first is a gradually rising carbon tax.
"The plan would return all the money raised directly to citizens, in the form of equal monthly dividends. The amount of the dividend would grow as the carbon tax rate increases. The bottom 70 percent of Americans would receive more in dividends than they would pay in increased energy prices."
"A carbon tax starting at 40 dollars per ton translates into roughly an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas. The plan by itself would meet the high end of America's commitment under the Paris Climate Agreement. ""We would end up with less regulation and far less pollution at the same time,"" he says."
"The U.S. should lead the way with a carbon dividend plan, says climate scientist. The plan would enable China to meet its environmental and economic goals at the same time, he says. It would be popular and populist, pro-growth and pro-business, he adds."
"Ted Halstead: The actions of this White House, the early actions on climate, are just the first move in a complex game of climate chess. The business community is fundamentally parting ways with the White House on climate change. Within two months, we're going to be announcing some really surprising names coming out in favor of this."
"The U.S. is planning to pull out of the Paris climate accord. The U.N. says the international pressure will be ""overwhelming"" to stay in the agreement. The White House says it has a plan to replace Paris."
"CNN's Jim Boulden talks about the problem of focusing on the short term. He says people tend to focus on what they have to do now, rather than what they need to do later. The short-term effect can be devastating, he says, but the long-term impact can be worth it."
"A recent analysis of 201 studies on the effectiveness of money-management training came to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all. George Orwell, one of the greatest writers who ever lived, experienced poverty firsthand in the 1920s. The essence of poverty, he wrote back then, is that it ""annihilates the future"""
"CNN's John Defterios explores the idea of a basic income guarantee. It's a monthly grant, enough to pay for your basic needs: food, shelter, education. The philosopher Thomas More first hinted at it in his book, ""Utopia,"" 500 years ago."
"In 1974, Dauphin, Canada, guaranteed everyone in the town a basic income. For four years, all went well. But then a new government was voted into power, and the new Canadian cabinet saw little point to the expensive experiment."
"The hospitalization rate decreased by as much as 8.5 percent. Domestic violence incidents were down, as were mental health complaints. The only ones who worked a little less were new mothers and students. Similar results have since been found in countless other experiments around the globe."
"Dauphin's basic income guarantee would cost 500 billion dollars a year. It would be funded by a negative income tax, which would be topped up as soon as you fall below the poverty line. In that scenario, according to our economists' best estimates, for a net cost of 175 billion -- a quarter of US military spending, one percent of GDP -- you could lift all impoverished Americans out of poverty."
"As much as 37 percent of British workers have a job that they think doesn't even need to exist. ""Too often we're working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need,"" says author. ""There is nothing inevitable about the way we structured our society and economy right now"""

"In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti finished a monumental commission in the governing council chamber of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico. He was cataloging the obligations of the governing to the governed. The majestic figure here in the middle is dressed in SienA's colors and he personifies the republic itself."
"Lorenzetti illustrates the effects of good government on the real and everyday lives of ordinary people. In the countryside, the hills are landscaped and farmed. Crops are being sown, hoed, reaped, milled, plowed."
"Lorenzetti illustrates the vices that animate bad government. The Tyrant has horns, tusks, crossed eyes, braided hair. Justice is the key antagonist to the Tyrant, and she's been taken out. Treason, half lamb, half scorpion, lulls us into a false sense of security."

Zika fever was first identified in 1947 in Uganda. First human cases surfaced a few years later in Uganda-Tanzania. The virus then spread through West Africa and east through equatorial Asia. It then next surfaced in 2013 in French Polynesia. An outbreak that affected fully 75 percent of the population.
"In early 2015, there was an upsurge of cases of a dengue-like syndrome in the city of Natal in northeastern Brazil. The virus is being locally transmitted by mosquitoes virtually throughout South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean Islands. Getting vaccinated is not an option, because there isn't a vaccine yet."
The more we find out about the Zika virus the more terrifying it becomes. Insecticides aren't very effective because they kill people as well as bugs. Insect repellent does work ... until you forget. And we of course can spray insecticides from planes.
"Doctors have noticed an uptick of something called Guillain-Barré syndrome in recent outbreaks. Insects were irradiated until they were sterile, grown to adulthood and then released from planes. British company genetically modified that mosquito so that when it mates with a wild female, its eggs don't develop."
"Oxitec designed the mosquito so that when the male mates with the wild female the eggs don't develop. The extra copies, however, go and gum up the mosquitoes' genes, killing the organism. To keep it alive in the laboratory they use a compound called tetracycline."
"In Brazil, a genetically modified mosquito brought down dengue cases by 91 percent. In the US, there are three agencies that regulate genetically modified organisms. It took the FDA two years to decide that it would be the FDA that would regulate the mosquito."
"Biological control of harmful insects can be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly than using insecticides. Doctors in northeastern Brazil first noticed, just a year ago, that there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly. A bipartisan group of more than 60 legislators wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell asking that she expedite access for Florida to this new technology."
"Google and Facebook are working on ways to make their platforms less susceptible to polarization. To solve the problem of knowledge polarization, we're going to need to reconnect with one fundamental, philosophical idea: that we live in a common reality. To really accept it, we need to do three things, each of which is a challenge."
"The author says objective truth is an illusion because ""man is the measure of all things"" That's not a new philosophical thought -- skepticism about truth was popular at the end of the last century. The author says we might as well admit that objective truth doesn't matter, because we'll never know what it is."
Skepticism about truth can be tempting because it allows us to rationalize away our own biases. The fake news that spread on the internet during the American presidential election was designed to inflate our bubbles. But the really dangerous thing about skepticism with regard to truth is that it leads to despotism.
"O'Brien: In order to accept that we really live in a common reality, we have to believe in truth. The second thing can be summed up by the Latin phrase that Kant took as the motto for the Enlightenment: ""Sapere aude,"" or ""dare to know"""
"The more information we have, the harder it is to know what's real and what's not. We need to be more open to the evidence and experience of others, says author David Walliams. And we need to have a little humility, he says."
"We tend to confuse arrogance and confidence, he says. It's just easier to think of yourself as knowing it all. Democracies can't function if their citizens don't strive to inhabit a common space. We've got to have the humility to realize that we're not the measure of all things."
"The New England Patriots are the most successful team in NFL history. The Patriots have won seven Super Bowls. The team has won more than 1,000 games since the start of the 2010 season. They have won the most Super Bowl titles (four) since the Patriots won their first in 1991."

"Elizabeth has pseudoxanthoma elasticum, PXE for short. It's a rare genetic disorder, it's systemic, and it's a slowly progressing, premature aging disease. It causes loose wrinkly skin in the flexor areas."
"PXE causes legal blindness, like macular degeneration, and a host of cardiovascular problems. Little is known about this disease, and some people die in their 30s. Researchers competed with each other because the ecosystem was designed to reward competition rather than to alleviate suffering."
PXE International is a group of scientists who collect and share DNA and medical records. The group was started before the internet was in common use. PXE is dedicated to initiating and conducting research on the disease and supporting individuals with the disease.
"""We found the gene. We patented it so that it would be freely available. We created a diagnostic test. We put together a research consortium. We held research meetings and opened a center of excellence. We found more than 4,000 people around the world who had PXE. We built scalable and extensible resources, like biobanks and registries."
"The Genetic Alliance is a group of citizen scientists, activists and hacks. They are using crowdsourcing, do-it-yourself science to change the game. President Obama and Vice President Biden are evangelists for the idea that people should be partners in research."

"This is not just a crisis, it's a test that civilizations have faced down the ages. Refugees are a hard case. They do come from faraway parts of the world. They have been through trauma. Those are precisely the reasons we should be helping refugees. It's revealing of our values."
Writer's mother was sent to start a new life in a new country on her own at the age of 12. Refugees seeking sanctuary have seen the West as a source of hope and a place of haven. The reason that refugees have rights around the world is because of extraordinary Western leadership by statesmen and women.
"I want you to think in a new way, but I also want to do things for refugees. The duty to strangers shows itself in small ways and big, prosaic and heroic. I know this: if Britain had not admitted refugees in the 1940s, I certainly would not be here today."
"In 1942, my aunt and my grandmother were living in Brussels under German occupation. They received a summons from the Nazi authorities to go to Brussels Railway Station.

Katrina Spade: Cremation destroys the potential we have to give back to the earth after we've died. Cremations in the US emit a staggering 600 million pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually. Spade's work is not about predictions. It's about creating tools to connect our present and our future selves.
"When organic material dies in nature, microbes and bacteria break it down into nutrient-rich soil, completing the life cycle. Mortality composting is where you take an animal high in nitrogen and cover it with co-composting materials that are high in carbon."
"The process of composting is known as ""magic"" and is like the opposite of antibacterial soap. Instead of fighting them, we welcome microbes and bacteria in with open arms. The flesh has been decomposed entirely, as have the bones."
"Bodies and wood chips undergo accelerated natural decomposition, or composting, and are transformed into soil. Microbes and bacteria break down carbon, then protein, to create a new substance, a rich, earthy soil. This soil can then be used to grow new life."
We want to bring back the aspect of ritual that's been diluted over the past hundred years as cremation rates have risen and religious affiliation has declined. We're creating a design toolkit that will help others design and build facilities that will contain technical specifications and regulatory best practices.

"In the West we've stopped telling this story of who we are and why, even in America. And at the same time, immigration is higher than it's ever been before.

Professor of business and psychology has been studying the effect of screens on our lives. We work eight-and-a-half to nine hours a day. We engage in survival activities -- these are things like eating and bathing and looking after kids -- about three hours aday. That leaves this white space.
"In 2007, the year that Apple introduced the first iPhone, this much was spent in front of a screen. That's how much time we spend of that free time inFront of our screens. So what do we do about this? Well, the first question is: What does that red space look like?"
"People spend an average of nine minutes a day on each of these apps. About half the people, when you interrupt them and say, ""How do you feel?"" say they don't feel good about using them. One of the reasons we spend so much time on these apps is they rob us of stopping cues."
"The way we consume media today is such that there are no stopping cues. A Dutch design firm rigged the desks to the ceiling at 6pm every day. At Daimler, the German car company, they've got another great strategy. It's really up to you which ones you stick around for."
"CNN's John Sutter talks about how to avoid using your phone at dinner. Sutter: It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm, I'm going to not use my phone. But he says a better strategy is to do certain things every day, like eating dinner."
"Steve Jobs: Screens are miraculous; I've already said that, and I feel that it's true. But the way we use them is a lot like driving down a really fast, long road, and you're in a car where the accelerator is mashed to the floor. You've got a choice. You can either glide by, past, say, the beautiful ocean scenes and take snaps out the window. Or you can go out of your way to move the car to the"
"James Madison was the ""Einstein"" of the US Constitution. He thought he had designed a constitution that was against political parties. Today that same constitutional technology is still in use not only in the US, but in places like Canada, India, South Africa, Brazil."
"Hamilton and Madison were close friends and co-authors of the Federalist Papers. When Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury, he had a specific idea in mind. He wanted to give the U.S. a national bank, a permanent national debt and a manufacturing policy. Madison went utterly ballistic."
CNN's John Sutter looks at the rise and fall of the U.S. political parties in the early 1800s. Sutter: The two parties adopted positions on national politics that were extreme and exaggerated. He says the Constitution did its work in surprising ways that Madison himself had not fully anticipated.
"In 1800, the Republicans managed to win a national election -- that was in 1800. They actually, over time, managed to put the Federalists completely out of business. The thing about the separation of powers is that it did then and it does now, drive governance to the center."
"President Obama says the U.S. Constitution is designed to deal with factional disagreement. He says the president can't get anything done unless other people agree with his policies. Obama: Stand up for what you believe in, support the organizations that you care about."
"The Constitution is an evolving, subtly, supplely designed entity that has the specific purpose of teaching us how to manage factional disagreement. Scientists have been able to leverage the immune system in the fight against cancer. Over 600 clinical trials are open, actively recruiting patients to explore immunotherapy."
"Even a cancer as small as one centimeter in diameter harbors over a hundred million different cells. While genetically similar, there are small differences in these different cancers that make them differently prone to different drugs. So even if you have a drug that's highly effective, there is a chance that there's a small population that's resistant to the drug."
"The key to cancer and curing cancer is early detection. Only 15 percent of women are detected at stage one, whereas the vast majority, 70 percent, are detected in stages three and four. The current best ways to screen cancer fall into one of three categories. Medical procedures are the gold standard; they are highly invasive and require a large infrastructure."
"Cancer cells grow and die faster than normal cells, and when they die, DNA is shed into the blood system. Most of the DNA that's detected will be from healthy cells. However, there will be a small amount, less than one percent, that comes from the cancer cells."
"The genome is a composition of all the genetic information encoded by DNA in an organism. Ultimately, we have information of billions of letters that output from this run. The key, then, is to see whether we're able to detect these recurrences of cancers earlier than with standard methods."
"At day 340, we see the rise in the cancer DNA in the blood. That means we are catching this cancer over a hundred days earlier than traditional methods. The next time you hear the word ""cancer,"" I want you to add to the emotions: hope."
"The Northern Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds of its corals last year over a distance of hundreds of miles. The first time I cried underwater was in 2008, the island of Curaçao, way down in the southern Caribbean. The second revolution is precision medicine, also known as ""personalized medicine"""
Caribbean reefs have been hit hard by climate change. But some of the best-protected reefs have managed to hold onto their corals. Some of the worst-hit reefs are on the island of Curaçao in the Caribbean.
"The best time to protect a reef was 50 years ago, but the second-best time is right now. Even as we go through bleaching events, some corals will be able to recover. Some corals can regrow in 10 years -- others take a lot longer."
"The coral is an endangered species, but can recover if it's given a chance, he says. Corals have been living on planet Earth for hundreds of millions of years. They survived the extinction of the dinosaurs, and are badasses, he adds."
"Coral reefs in the Pacific are losing corals faster than we've ever seen before. Because of climate change, the water is so hot for so long in the summers, the animals can't function normally. A scientist in Guam wrote, ""I cried right into my mask,"" seeing the damage on the reefs."
"The Department of Transport estimated that last year 35,000 people died from traffic crashes in the US alone. Worldwide, 1.2 million people die every year in traffic accidents. People online on social media have been coming up with all sorts of ways to not think about this problem. The point is, waiting for full safety is also a choice, and it also involves trade-offs."
"People want cars to be utilitarian, minimize total harm, and that's what we should all do. But there is a little catch. When we asked people whether they would purchase such cars, they said, ""Absolutely not"" If there was a way we could eliminate 90 percent of those accidents, would you support it? Most people sided with Bentham."
"Car manufacturers may simply program cars that will maximize safety for their clients. The cars may learn automatically on their own that doing so requires slightly increasing risk for pedestrians. So to use the sheep metaphor, it's like we now have electric sheep that have a mind of their own."
Moral Machine generates random dilemmas in a sequence where you have to choose what the car should do in a given scenario. So far we've collected over five million decisions by over one million people worldwide. And this is helping us form an early picture of what trade-offs people are comfortable with.
"CNN's John Defterios asks: What should a car do when it comes to a collision with another car? He says the answer is to make sure it doesn't cause any harm to the other person. Defterio: ""It's a question of what is the right thing to do and how to do it"""

Computer vision can tell the difference between a cat and a dog. The technology could be used to build self-driving vehicles or robotic systems. The first computer vision cover was drawn by Rea Irvin in 1925. It shows a dandy looking at a butterfly through his monocle.
"In just a few years, we've gone from 20 seconds per image to 20 milliseconds per image, a thousand times faster. With our system, instead of looking at an image thousands of times to produce detection, you only look once. With this speed, we're not just limited to images; we can process video in real time."
"The system is free and available to anyone to use. It can be used to find cancer cells in tissue. It's also being used in medicine, robotics and other fields. The system is being developed by the University of Washington's computer science department."
"""We don't know what's going on in the image. We just know that it's a dog or a cat,"" he says. ""That's what we're trying to do here. We're not trying to find out what's in the picture."""
"In the first year, we found about 13 wrongful convictions, people having been in jail for decades, and we released all of them. It was the most in New York history. The program is still going on, and they're up to 21 releases now -- 21 people who spent significant time behind bars."
"The case seemed like it was open and shut, but it was a single-witness case. The number indicated that this witness had a record. It turned out the eyewitness was in jail when she said she saw what she saw. The man spent 17 years behind bars."

"CNN's John Sutter talks to scientists about what happens to the brain when we're bored. Sutter: When we're not doing anything, our brains are in ""default mode"" He asks: What happens if we never get bored? And what if we were able to do something about it?"
"The average person switches tasks on their computer 566 times a day. When people are stressed, they tend to shift their attention more rapidly. The shorter the amount of sleep that a person gets, the more likely they are to check Facebook."
"MZ asked his listeners to track how much time they spend on their phones. The project, ""Bored and Brilliant,"" was a success. MZ: What if we reclaimed those cracks in our day? Could it help us jump-start our creativity?"
"Tina Fey: People were starting to observe their own behavior. Fey: ""Put it in your pocket. Take that phone out of your hand. See if you can eliminate the reflex to check it all day long, just for a day"" MZ: If this sounds easy, you haven't tried it."
"The average person will spend two years of their life on Facebook. As one UX designer told me, the only people who refer to their customers as ""users"" are drug dealers and technologists. The CEO of Netflix recently said, ""Our biggest competitors are Facebook, YouTube and sleep"""
"Lisa Alpert: ""I was bored, I guess. So I suddenly looked at the stairway that went up to the top of the station"" ""I got on that R train feeling kind of exhausted, but, like, wow, that had never occurred to me"""
"MZ: I could not wait to see what the numbers said at the end of that week. But when the data came in, it turned out that we had cut down, on average, just six minutes. MZ: Some of them told me that they didn't recognize some of the emotions that they felt."
"20,000 people did ""Bored and Brilliant"" that week. Ninety percent cut down on their minutes. Seventy percent got more time to think. The next time you go to check your phone, remember that if you don't decide how you're going to use it, the platforms will decide for you."
Beauty is sculpted by factors that contribute to the survival of the group. Average faces represent the central tendencies of a group. People with mixed features represent different populations. Many people find mixed-race individuals attractive and inbred families less so.
"People generally find symmetric faces more attractive than asymmetric ones. Estrogen and testosterone play important roles in shaping features that we find attractive. A face that's too baby-like might mean that the girl is not yet fertile, so men find women attractive who have large eyes, full lips and narrow chins."
"Charles Darwin wrote that the sight of the peacock's tail made him physically ill. Darwin couldn't explain it with his theory of natural selection, so he developed the theory of sexual selection. Only especially fit organisms can afford to divert resources to maintaining such an extravagant appendage."
"In 10 generations, 98 percent of a population has a green preference. Attractive faces activate parts of our visual cortex in the back of the brain. Our visual brain that is tuned to processing faces interacts with our pleasure centers. Our brains respond to attractive faces even when we're not thinking about beauty."
"Studies suggest our brain automatically responds to beauty by linking vision and pleasure. We also have a ""beauty is good"" stereotype embedded in the brain. Our brains seem to reflexively associate beauty and good. We need to understand these kinds of implicit biases if we are to overcome them."
Modern medicine and technological innovation is profoundly affecting the very essence of what it means to look beautiful. The universal nature of beauty is changing even as we're changing the universe. The selection criteria for reproductive success from that time doesn't really apply today.
"""I found anger; there was a lot of that. But what I found more of was love. People with love for themselves,"" he says. ""It was beautiful -- until the police showed up. Then a new emotion was interjected into the conversation: fear"""

"The longer we live, the more different we become from one another. It's not healthy to go through life dreading our futures. The sooner we get off this hamster wheel of age denial, the better off we are, says author."
"Nobody's born ageist, but it starts at early childhood. negative messages about late life bombard us from the media and popular culture. Older people can be the most ageist of all, because we've had to internalize these messages. Only 12 percent of speaking or named characters in Best Picture nominations were age 60 and up."
"Only four percent of older Americans are living in nursing homes, according to a new study. ""It's not having a vagina that makes life harder for women,"" says author. ""I stopped blaming my sore knee on being 64. My other knee doesn't hurt, and it's just as old"""
"Aging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured, he says. Aging is a natural, powerful, lifelong process that unites us all. The longer we wait to challenge that idea, the more damage it does to ourselves and our place in the world."
"Research shows attitudes towards aging affect how our minds and bodies function at the cellular level. World Health Organization is developing a global anti-ageism initiative to extend not just life span but health span. Women experience the double whammy of ageism and sexism, so we experience aging differently."
"One in five people in the world will be over the age of 60, according to the World Health Organisation. Almost three-quarters of those over 60 say they have trouble paying for basic necessities. The world needs to make it easier for people of all ages to make ends meet, says the WHO."

"Music is my way of coping with the changes in my life, says singer-songwriter. Music is something that lives inside of you. It connects you to the people you're playing with, to your audience and to yourself. It can bind us to reality at the same time it allows us to escape it."

"Cancer cells are coated with sugar. The sugars on the surface of your cells might be telling us that you have cancer. Knowing your blood type is one of the most important medical procedures in the world, says Dr. Michael Bociurkiw."
"Sialic acid is a sugar that is found at certain levels on all of the cells in your body. It's actually quite common on your cells. But for some reason, cancer cells tend to have more than a normal, healthy cell would have."
"The sugar coating on our cells is like the sugar coating of a peanut M and M. The immune cells go around and taste all the cells in your body. Once in a while, a cell might taste bad, and when those immune cells get the bad taste, they launch an all-out strike and kill those cells."
"When an immune cell snuggles up against a cancer cell to take a taste, it's looking for signs of disease. But if that cancer cell has a dense forest of that sugar, sialic acid, well, it starts to taste pretty good. There's a protein on immune cells that grabs the siali acid, and if that protein gets held at that synapse, it puts that immune cell to sleep."

"The ""Dot Collector"" is a computer that is watching. It watches what all these people are thinking and it correlates that with how they think. It communicates advice back to each of them based on that. Then it draws the data from all the meetings to create a pointilist painting."
"When he was 12, I hated school but I fell in love with trading the markets. It's why we've made more money for our clients than any other hedge fund in existence and made money 23 out of the last 26 years. Critics say it's a formula for a brutal work environment."
"It takes about 18 months typically to find that most people prefer operating this way, he says. ""There's not politics, there's not the brutality of ... all of that hidden, behind-the-scenes"" It's an idea meritocracy where people can speak up. ""It's given us more effective work, and it's given me more effective relationships"""
"CNN.com editor-in-chief John Sutter talks to CNN.com readers about his new project. Sutter: ""This sort of radical transparency is coming at you and it is going to affect your life. And in my opinion, it's going to be wonderful"""
"People who have meaning in life are more resilient, do better in school and at work, and live longer. Belonging comes from being in relationships where you're valued for who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well. True belonging springs from love and it's a choice -- you can choose to cultivate belonging with others."
"For many people, belonging is the most essential source of meaning. For others, the key to meaning is the second pillar: purpose. Purpose is less about what you want than what you give. The key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others."
"Without something worthwhile to do, people flounder. Belonging, purpose, transcendence are the third and fourth pillars of meaning. The fourth pillar is storytelling, the story you tell yourself about yourself. The third pillar of meaning is about stepping beyond yourself, but in a completely different way."
"Your life isn't just a list of events. You can edit, interpret and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts. Creating a narrative from the events of your life brings clarity. It helps you understand how you became you."
"The suicide rate has been rising around the world, and it recently reached a 30-year high in America. Belonging, purpose, transcendence, storytelling: those are the four pillars of meaning. The pillars were part of the architecture, and the presence of the pillars helped us all live more deeply."
"Gangs, cults use the pillars to give people something to live and die for. The same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones. Even though life is getting objectively better, more people feel hopeless, depressed and alone."
"People who can't trust their neighbors and who don't feel safe in their neighborhoods have shorter telomeres. So your home address matters for telomere maintenance as well. ""I have the power to impact my own life and you can impact yours"""
"CNN's John Sutter asks: Will we invest in the next young woman or man peering through a microscope at the next little critter, curious about a question we don't even know today is a question? Sutter: ""It could be a great question that could impact all the world"""
"Every time a cell divides and the DNA is copied, some of that DNA from the ends gets worn down and shortened. When that tip gets too short, it falls off, and that worn down telomere sends a signal to the cells. The DNA is no longer being protected."
"As we age, our telomeres do shorten, and remarkably, that shortening is aging us. It's the overshortening of telomere that leads us to feel and see signs of aging. Telomere attrition is contributing to our risks of cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes."
"CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says we live on a knife edge when it comes to our telomeres. Nudging up telomerase increases the risks of certain and rather nasty cancers, he says. ""It isn't about enormously extending human lifespan or immortality. It's about health span,"" Gupta says."
"The opposite of health span is the time of your life spent feeling old and sick and dying. The real question becomes, if I can't guzzle telomerase, do I have control over my telomeres' length and hence my well-being, my health?"
"The more chronic stress you are under, the shorter your telomeres. The longer, the more years that is, the mother had been in this caregiving situation, no matter her age. The more she perceived her situation as being more stressful, the lower was her telomerase."
"Researchers are revealing that we have more control over this particular aging process than any of us could ever have imagined. If you're habitually a negative thinker, you typically see a stressful situation with a threat stress response. A persistently high level of the stress hormone cortisol actually damps down your telomerase."
"CNN's John Defterios has spent 15 years studying life in the Yungay desert, one of the most arid places on Earth. He has found that life has adapted to live with almost no water at all, and even photosynthetic life inside caves."
"María Elena South is the truly driest place on Earth, as dry as Mars. Microorganisms may still be active in the desiccated state, like walking mummies. If confirmed, this would have a huge impact on our definition of life, on how we look for life elsewhere in the universe."
"In the Atacama, there are places with no reported rains in the last 400 years. Intelligence isn't really about the individual but somehow a property of the group itself. The question for AI then becomes, what are those rules of engagement that lead to this kind of intelligence?"
"The robot can wirelessly communicate with other robots, and it can measure distances from them. Once we have this system, we can start to program many different kinds of rules of engagement that you would see in nature. We can also take these rules that we've learned from nature and combine them and create entirely new collective behaviors of our very own."
"Researchers created robots that could build together. They took inspiration from social insects, such as mound-building termites and army ants. With the right motion rules and the right pattern rules, we can get the robots to build whatever we want. The illusion becomes almost so perfect, you know -- you just start to not even notice that they're individual robots."
"Scientists are working to create robots that can help build levees and flood barriers. They are also working on creating robots and thinking about rules that will improve our own scientific collective. ""I believe that we can choose our rules, and we engineer not just robots but we can engineer our own human collective, and if we do and when we do, it will be beautiful"""
"Giant clams were almost hunted to extinction between the 1960s and 1980s. They are now popular as jewelry and for display in China. The discovery of giant clams has led to a new focus on artificial intelligence, says the author."
"The largest clam in the world is facing the threat of extinction, with more than 50 percent of the wild population severely depleted. Giant clams are reef builders, food factories, shelters for shrimps and crabs and water filters. Because they can live up to 100 years old, giant clams make vital indicators of coral reef health."
"Giant clams are the largest of their kind. The biggest recorded individual was four-and-a-half-feet long and weighed about 550 pounds. ""It is time for the giant clams to step out of their shells, and show the world that they, too, can be the heroes of the oceans"""
"Before Nigeria became a country, fisherpeople from the inland creeks started to come down the Lagos lagoon. Many Lagosians, including the descendants of those fisherpeople who arrived generations before my grandfather, are now being pushed out to make room for an emergent city."
"Last October, the Governor announced plans to demolish every single waterfront settlement in Lagos. There are more than 40 of these indigenous communities all over the city, with over 300,000 people living in them. Otodo Gbame, a hundred-year-old fishing village, was one of the first to be targeted."
"Lagos is a city of the poor, but it is also a place of innovation and creativity. The city's slums are an example of how people can make a difference in their communities. They are also examples of the city's resilience and ability to adapt to change."
"The Lagos state government pays lip service to ideas of inclusion. But progress can only be achieved by the erasure, exploitation and even elimination of groups it considers expendable. Queer Africans continue to exist, even though queerness is now criminalized in most parts of the continent."
"Lagos is my home. I like to believe that my grandfather, in mapping new frontiers for Lagos, was trying to open it up to make room for other people. It is too late now for Basil, but not for the hundreds of thousands, the millions still under threat in Lagos."
"Mahari: I teach college students about inequality and race in education. Mahari: As a teacher, I also study achievement, but from a slightly different perspective. He says he's met students who have overcome immense obstacles related to their background. Mahri: I've met two of the grittiest people I've ever met."
Vanessa had to drop out of school when she was 15. She went on to get her GED. Her son was born with only one kidney. She was able to get a job and raise her son. He is now a high school senior.
"Teaching is social and benefits from social scaffolding, says professor. ""I'm one of the few faculty members of color, and growing up, I experienced my family's social mobility,"" she says. ""Even though I know hard work is what got him this achievement, I've seen him find his voice along the way"""
"Mahari was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal, and became a chef in the US. He rediscovered an ancient grain called fonio that had all but disappeared from the urban Senegalese diet. Fonio had been cultivated for more than five thousand years and is probably the oldest cultivated cereal in Africa."
"Fonio is a miracle grain in many aspects. It is nutritious, particularly rich in methionine and cysteine, two amino acids that are deficient in most other major grains. Fonio cultivation is great for the environment. It tolerates poor soil and needs very little water."
"More than 2,000 people have died trying to get to Europe in the past year. More than 60 million people are expected to move to Europe by 2020. Fonio is a new way to make and sell food in the U.S. and other countries."
Fonio is a type of rice grown in the West African nation of Senegal. It was introduced by the French in the 19th century as a replacement for rice from the east. Fonio has a long history of being used as a source of food for the poor.
"Fonio is consumed all across the globe as other popular ancient grains. Fonio touted on the levels of cereals, breads, nutrition bars, cookies, pastas, snacks. To get there, fonio needs to be readily available at a consistent quality for commercial users."
Fonio has been introduced to shoppers in New York City and online. Hunger levels are higher in sub-Saharan Africa than any other place in the world. The Sahel population is set to grow from 135 million to 340 million people.
"From 2008 to 2016, more than three million people were ""ordered removed"" from the U.S. ""My country"" is a collection of these strong relationships. When the social circles are weakened, a country itself is weakened. We're missing a crucial aspect in the debate about immigration policy."
"Ramon and his son were ordered out of the country in 2016. Ramon was being deported to Latin America, while his son was being deployed. An immigration lawyer argued he was too important to the local community to be deported. In the end, a judge exercised what's called ""judicial discretion"""
"There are 23 million noncitizens in the U.S., according to federal data. That's about 100 million individuals whose social circles could be impacted by deportation. A 2017 poll by UCLA found that 30 percent of citizens in LA County are stressed about deportation."
The Green Lady is actually the Statue of Liberty. She was born into a family of immigrants in the United States. The story of her origin is based on a British study of women's lives in the 1940s and 1950s. The study asked women how much milk they drank and how long they spent on their babies.
"More than 70,000 children have been involved in these studies across those five generations. Scientists have also built up a huge bank of tissue samples, which includes locks of hair, nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA. They've even collected 9,000 placentas from some of the births, which are now pickled in plastic buckets."
"Many children in this study were born into poor families or into working-class families that had cramped homes or other problems. They've been more likely to do worse at school, to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money. Children who had a tough start in life are also more Likely to be overweight, to have high blood pressure and to die earlier."
"Scientists looked at 17,000 children who were born in 1970. Children who had engaged, interested parents were more likely to escape from a difficult start. Talking and listening to a child, responding to them warmly, teaching them their letters and numbers, taking them on trips and visits is also important."
"Researchers looked at the bedtime routines of about 10,000 children born at the turn of the millennium. The data showed that children who were reading for pleasure at the ages of five and 10 were more likely to go on in school better, on average, on school tests."
"Good parenting only reduced the educational gap between the rich and poor children by about 50 percent. ""Tackling child poverty is an incredibly important thing to do,"" says Dr. David Perry. ""It's helped me become more confident about how I bring up my own children,"" he says."
"Scientists in Britain have been following thousands of children through their lives as part of an incredible scientific study. Scientists can compare the ones who say, do well at school or end up healthy or happy or wealthy as adults, and those who struggle much more."
"Photographer and conservationist David Perry shot 37 insects over two-and-a-half years. He split the insect up into multiple sections, and treated each one of those sections like a small still life. The issue with photography at high magnification is that there is inherently a very shallow depth of field. Perry uses a rail that he can automate to move 10 microns in between each shot."
"Each one of his images is made up of anywhere between 8- and 10,000 separate shots. They take about three-and-a-half weeks to create, and the file sizes on average are about four gigabytes. The prints at the exhibition are around the three-meter mark."
"Despite the extraordinary things I was experiencing, they'd started to feel a little bit ordinary to me. I couldn't believe I was in possession of this beautiful creature. And at the end of the day, actually, we have to wipe down the lower third of the big prints just to remove all those sticky handprints."
Sebastian Schulder was given the opportunity to take a picture of a shield bug. Schuender says he wanted to show that his images had a sense of worth again. He says he often wonders what Charles Darwin would make of his images.

"The World Health Organization reports that depression is the leading cause of sickness and disability. Research suggests that most mental disorders develop, at least in part, because of a chemical imbalance in the brain. For black Americans, stressors like racism and socioeconomic disparities put them at a 20 percent greater risk of developing a mental disorder."

"Robam kbach boran, or the art of Khmer classical dance, is more than 1,000 years old. It is a transformation of nature, of both the physical world around us and of our own internal universe. The four gestures are then used to create a whole entire language with which dancers express themselves."
"Dance was developed as a prayer in movement for rain and fertility. The Khmer word for art, silapak, in fact, at its root, means ""magic"" I am very proud to say that I belong to a long line of magicians."
"Cambodia was ruled by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979. Dancers were used to carry the prayers of the people to the gods. The majority of people were forced to work in the fields and fields of rice paddies. They were called ""slaves of the sacred dance"""

"Games like ""Curious George"" can help kids learn about the world around them. Games can also be used to teach kids how to behave in public places. The game was created by Boston-based WGBH, which teaches math to children."
"UCLA researchers used game-play data to predict a child's math scores. The results were astonishingly accurate, especially considering the fact that these games weren't built for assessment. The team that did this study believes that games like these can teach us more about children's cognitive learning than a standardized test."
A new study shows that talking to kids about what they're watching can help them develop empathy. The study was published by the University of Texas at Austin. CNN's John Sutter asked his four-year-old son to play a game with him.

"The world has been stuck on a single narrative around a coming global food crisis. The new question is, how do we produce 214 trillion calories to feed 8.3 billion people by 2027? We have the solution. We just need to act on it."
"The world will be short of food by 2027, according to a new report. The report was commissioned by the World Economic Forum. It is the first time the report has looked at the issue in its entirety. The world is not in a position to fill this gap, the report says."
"Not all foods are created equal, even if they weigh the same. A single Big Mac has 563 calories. The world will be short 379 billion Big Macs in 2027. That is more Big Mac's than McDonald's has ever produced. It is calories which sustain us."
"The 2050 narrative started to evolve shortly after global food prices hit all-time highs in 2008. The deeper, the brighter the red, the more you're importing. Most of the African continent, Europe, most of Asia, South America excluding Argentina, were all net importers of calories."
"India had a green revolution. It's become food self-sufficient. And China went from that light blue to the brightest red that you see on this map. How did we get here? What happened? So this chart shows you India and Africa. Blue line is India, red line is Africa."
"By 2023, Africa's population is forecasted to overtake that of India's and China's. India will soon become a net importer of calories, according to forecasters. By 2050, 2050 is so far into the future that we can't even relate to it."
"Until now, countries with calorie deficits have been able to meet these deficits by importing from surplus regions. Most of this growth is going to come at the huge cost of deforestation. We can change consumption patterns, we can reduce food waste, or we can make a bold commitment to increasing yields exponentially."
"China, India, Africa are key to the solution to the global food crisis. China is constrained in terms of how much more land it has available for agriculture, and it has massive water resource availability issues. The African continent has vast amounts of arable land remaining and significant upside potential in yields."

"The UN says billions of people still live without an address. The world is divided into three-meter squares to make it easier for people to find their way around the world. ""There are many paths to happiness and fulfillment. They all look very different, but I believe that every one is paved with the right to self-determination"""
The world divides into around 57 trillion three-meter squares. There are enough combinations of three dictionary words to name every three- meter square in the world uniquely with just three words. The UN are using it to geotag photos in disaster zones so they can deliver aid to exactly the right place.
"Three-word addresses are being adopted in Nigeria, Djibouti and Côte d'Ivoire. The aim is to make it easier for people to find their homes and businesses. The address system was created to help people find their way around the world."
"In 2015, the number of land mine casualties in war-torn countries almost doubled. MineSafe uses information from the community to suggest paths that have been declared as the most transited without accident or incident caused by a land mine. The app can also be used to determine the top priority zones to be de-mined."
The project is being funded by the U.S. government. It aims to help farmers find new land to grow food. The project is also working with the governments of Colombia and Somalia. It is the first of its kind in the world and aims to end landmine use.
"The Origen Power Process feeds natural gas into a fuel cell. About half the chemical energy is converted into electricity. The remainder is used to break down limestone into lime and carbon dioxide. The lime that you produce can be used in industrial processes, and it scrubs CO2 out of the air."
"The world needs to remove trillions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change. We need to put in place step-by-step governance for experiments to assess this safely, he says. We don't fully understand what the environmental consequences are, and we need to assess whether this treatment is actually better than the disease that it is seeking to cure."
"CNN's Chris Anderson speaks to climate change campaigner Chris Anderson. Anderson: ""Can we cure climate change? I don't know, but we certainly can't if we don't try"" Anderson: Tell us a bit more about this idea of putting lime in the ocean to absorb CO2."

"The gut is our largest sensory organ, collecting information on the quality of our nutrients. 90 percent of the nervous fibers that connect gut and brain deliver information from our gut to our brain. In stressful situations, when there are transmitters from the brain that are being sensed by our gut, the gut will try to lower all the work."

"""Lagoon"" is a new novel by Nigerian-American writer Ayo Ogunlesi. The book is about a man who travels to Lagos, Nigeria, to meet an alien race. The author says he was inspired by his Nigerian heritage to write."
"Because so many people in Lagos had portable, chargeable, glowing, vibrating, chirping, tweeting, communicating, connected devices, practically everything was recorded and posted online. The modern human world is connected like a spider's web. The world was watching. It watched in fascinated horror for information, but mostly for entertainment."
"For Africans, homegrown science fiction can be a will to power. Like Udide, the spider artist, African science fiction's blood runs deep and it's old. When it does, imagine the new technologies, ideas and sociopolitical changes it'll inspire."
"When someone comes out as gay, people know what that means, but when you come out as trans, you have to face the misconceptions. Many trans people will only ever undergo one procedure in their lifetime. Instead, the first step for a trans person seeking physical transition is usually hormone replacement therapy."
"There's no distinct point in physical transition at which a trans person becomes their true gender. As soon as they tell you their new name and pronouns, that's when you start using them. It's a huge point of discussion in trans communities about which bathroom to use."
"Being trans means a daily onslaught of misconceptions. Talk to trans people. Amplify our voices. Take the heat off of us and educate those around you so we don't have to every time. These bathroom bills aren't protecting anyone. All they're doing is ensuring that when trans people are assaulted in bathrooms, the law will no longer be on our side."
Being trans is awkward because everyone else gets awkward when they're around me. People are pretty much always wondering how we have sex and what kind of equipment we're working with below the belt. Part of what was so nerve-racking about coming out as transgender was knowing that people wouldn't know what I meant.

"My dad has frontotemporal lobe dementia, or FTD. I shouldn't murder Dad with heroin, but I've got to get him out of that body. I gave him a ginger ale and just started talking about nothing in particular. As I was talking, he sneezed from the ginger ale. It jerked his body upright, sparking him back to life a little bit."
"My dad's been sick for a decade, but three years ago he got really sick. He had to move into a facility for round-the-clock care when he was just 65. It's a confusing disease that hits people in their 50s or 60s."
"Climate change is changing the distribution of water in the world. It's salty where it should be fresh; it's liquid where it's frozen; and in fact, the very chemistry of the ocean itself is changing. This changes the very operating environment that we're working in and threatens our bases."

"Scientists believe deep sleep is the most regenerative stage of sleep. When we don't get the deep sleep we need, it inhibits our ability to learn. Deep sleep is how we convert all those interactions that we make during the day into our long-term memory."
"A German lab showed that if you could play certain sounds at the right time in people's sleep, you could actually make sleep deeper and more efficient. The sound pattern actually primes your mind to have more of these regenerative delta waves. When we asked participants the next day about the sounds, they were completely unaware that we played the sounds."
"The average American sleeps an hour less than they did in the 1940s. Poor sleep is linked to diseases like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes. Rwanda collects between 60- and 80,000 units of blood a year. It has been able to keep more blood centralized and then provide it when a patient needs it."
"Doctors in Rwanda use WhatsApp to send blood to a distribution center. The blood is then packed into a Zip, which is an autonomous airplane. The Zip can go from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in about half a second. The distribution center is located 20 kilometers outside of Kigali."
"We're able to watch the vehicle as it makes a delivery at a hospital in real time. We're delivering about 20 percent of the national blood supply of Rwanda outside of Kigali. We serve about 12 hospitals, and we're adding hospitals to that network at an accelerating rate."
"In the last nine months, zero units of blood have expired at any of these hospitals. That's an amazing result. It's actually not been achieved by any other health care system on the planet. But obviously, when we're talking about delivering medical products instantly, the most important thing is patients."
"Zipline is a company that uses electric autonomous aircraft to deliver medicine to hospitals and health centers on demand. Zipline founder says postpartum hemorrhaging is not a Rwanda problem, it's not a developing-world problem -- this is a global problem. He says Africa can out-innovate large, rich economies."

"Crowds come up with better judgments after talking with others in small groups, says Mariano Sigman. Sigman: As societies, we have to make collective decisions that will shape our future. Can this procedure of aggregating the results of debates in small group also help us decide on social and political issues?"
"Ariely asked participants to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong. Participants were also asked to rate how confident they were on their answers. We found once again that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes that it's completely right."
The majority of people at TED thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI and shut it down. Many groups reached a consensus even when they were composed of people with completely opposite views. The groups that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus.

"""I love this image of a woman in a hijab"" is the work of a Moroccan artist. ""I love the way she looks at the world through the eyes of a Muslim woman,"" she says. ""It's a beautiful thing to see a woman's face in a Muslim face"""
"""I want to show you what it means to be an African,"" says the artist. ""It is through art that we can really tell our own story,"" she says. ""We need to make sure that we don't just rely on the media to tell our stories"""
"Being multilingual gives your brain some remarkable advantages. The heightened workout a bilingual brain receives throughout its life can also help delay the onset of diseases, like Alzheimer's and dementia by as much as five years. The idea of major cognitive benefits to bilingualism may seem intuitive now, but it would have surprised  earlier experts."
"Most bilinguals around the world know and use their languages in varying proportions. Language ability is typically measured in two active parts, speaking and writing, and two passive parts, listening and reading. While bilingualism may not necessarily make you smarter, it does make your brain more healthy, complex and actively engaged."
"""There's nothing I haven't seen before,"" says mother-of-two. ""I cut up the side seam of the bottom of his pants to accommodate for his leg braces"" ""He absolutely beamed. He went into school with his head held so high"""
"Adaptive clothing is clothing designed for people with disabilities, the elderly and anyone who struggles with dressing themselves. Clothing can affect your mood, your health and your self-esteem. Scientists actually have a name for it: ""Enclothed Cognition"""
"When she was younger, she wanted to be Betsey Johnson. In 2013, she founded an organization called Runway of Dreams. The mission was to educate the fashion industry that modifications could be made to mainstream clothing for this community that has never been served."
"A former Rutgers football player was paralyzed during a tackle in 2010. He needed two aides and a lifting machine to get him dressed. ""Mindy, this is every single day. What can I say? I like to look sharp,"" Eric LeGrand said."
"Gianna's middle child, Oliver, was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy. She designed a way to get the clothing on and off the body, outside the traditional way. ""I am thrilled to say that the industry heard me,"" she says."
"Oliver's disease is degenerative, which means his muscles are going to break down over time. He wears his adaptive khakis, his magnetic button-front shirt -- feels like the coolest kid around. ""I have to sit on the sidelines and watch my boy deteriorate,"" his mother says."
"Emotions are used to explain many things, exploited by our politicians, manipulated by algorithms. Emotional intelligence is considered so important, that this is taught in our schools and businesses. But despite all of this, I sometimes wonder if the way we think about emotions is becoming impoverished."
"Emotions are not simple reflexes, but complex systems. They are shaped not just by our bodies, but by our thoughts, our language. What if we were to think again about those odd, untranslatable words for emotions? What if some cultures feel an emotion more intensely just because they've bothered to name and talk about it?"
"In the 17th century, a Swiss man fell ill with an illness known as ""nostalgia"" The illness was thought to be caused by the man's love of the city of Basel. Today, the illness is thought to have been caused by a lack of emotional connection."
"The last person to die from nostalgia was an American soldier fighting during the First World War in France. Today, not only does the word mean something different -- a sickening for a lost time rather than a lost place -- but homesickness itself is seen as less serious."
"The Baining people of Papua New Guinea speak of ""awumbuk,"" a feeling of heaviness. ""Amae"" is a Japanese word that means ""to hand over"" or ""to let go"" This might be a little simplistic, but it is tantalizing to think about."
"""Dépaysement"" is a French word for unfamiliar place. It evokes the giddy disorientation that you feel in an unfamiliar place, says historian. Learning new and unusual words for emotions will help attune us to the more finely grained aspects of our inner lives."
"In March 2017, the mayor of Cape Town officially declared Cape Town a local disaster, as it had less than four months left of usable water. Some smart, drought-affected countries have adopted simple, innovative measures to make sure their citizens, their communities and their companies know just how dry their countries are."
"When Cape Town faced one of the worst droughts of the country's history from 1997 to 2009, water levels dropped to a very low capacity of almost 26 percent. But the city didn't yell at people. It didn't plead with them not to use water. They used electronic billboards to flash available levels of water to all citizens across the city."
"A small water-flow regulator can be fitted into existing showerheads. Melbourne succeeded in reducing the water demands per capita by 50 percent. In the United Arab Emirates, officials designed what they called the ""Business Heroes Toolkit"" The aim was to motivate and empower businesses to reduce water and energy consumption."
Singapore is the eighth most water-scarce country in the world. It depends on imported water for almost 60 percent of its water needs. The Marina Barrage is the first-ever urban water reservoir built in the middle of the city-state. It has boosted Singapore's water supply by 10 percent.
"Namibia is one of the most arid countries in Southern Africa. Locals in Namibia have been drinking recycled water since 1968. Cape Town hasn't run out of water just yet. But as of September 3rd, the hundred-liter limit dropped to 87 liters."
"Less than five percent of the world's population is living in a country that has more water today than it did 20 years ago, according to the UN. If you are not at the mercy of mythical emotion circuits which are buried deep inside your brain somewhere, then who's responsible, who is responsible when you behave badly?"
"Emotions are guesses that your brain constructs in the moment where billions of brain cells are working together. You have more control over those guesses than you might imagine that you do. The surviving bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of Chechnya, was tried, convicted and sentenced to death."
"""Experiential blindness"" is a state where you see only black and white blobs. ""Predictions are basically the way your brain works,"" says neuroscientist. ""It's business as usual for your brain. Predictions are the basis of every experience that you have"""
Lisa Feldman Barrett: Predictions are primal. They help us to make sense of the world in a quick and efficient way. Barrett: The way that we see emotions in others are deeply rooted in predictions. She says emotions that you seem to detect in other people actually come in part from what's inside your head.
"The human brain is designed to make sense of the world around it. Emotions, such as sadness or anger, are just predictions of what the brain is going to do next. The brain has to make the connection between the feeling and what it is doing."
"CNN's John Defterios explains how your brain makes predictions about the world around you. For example, your brain might predict the delicious aroma of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, he says. But if it's a churning stomach, it can have a completely different meaning, he adds."
"Emotions are not what we think they are. When students learn to make this kind of energized determination instead of anxiety, they perform better on tests. That determination seeds their brain to predict differently in the future so that they can get their butterflies flying in formation."
"The next time that you feel intense distress, ask yourself: Could this have a purely physical cause? We have misunderstood the nature of emotion for a very long time, and understanding what emotions really are has important consequences for all of us. The next time you feel a sense of dread, try to understand what it is and what to do about it."
"""You have more control over your emotions than you might imagine,"" he says. ""All of us can do this and with a little practice, we can get really good at it, like driving,"" he adds. ""I find this to be a really empowering and inspiring message, and it's backed up by decades of experience"""
"People who brainstormed on the treadmill got twice as many ideas as those who didn't. The best way to brainstorm is to pick a topic and think about it ahead of time. If you're going to walk, it's better to do it before a big meeting."
"The idea here is to speak them. Keep coming up with new ones, until you pick one or two to pursue. It turns out, whatever physical activity is not taking a lot of attention. If you're on the walk and that idea's not coming to you, come back to it later at another time."
"CNN's iReport challenges people to come up with new ways to use everyday objects. In this test, people were asked to use a key as a third eyeball for a giraffe. People were also asked to think of a new way to open up a lock."
"Without informal carers like him, our health and social systems would crumble. Carers all over the world are sacrificing their own physical, financial and psychosocial well-being to provide care for their loved ones. Many of these carers are even in this room, as we have just seen."
"There are currently more than 100 million carers providing 80 percent of care across Europe. Carers provide personal care, like getting someone dressed, feeding them, helping them to the bathroom. They also provide a significant level of medical care, because they often know a lot about their loved one's condition."
"Many studies have shown that often carers sacrifice their own health and well-being in order to care for their loved ones. Many carers report that often, their employers don't have adequate policies in place to support them. An umbrella organization called the International Alliance of Carer Organizations was formed to bring together carer groups from all over the world."
"Caring for someone should be a choice and should be done without putting one's own well-being in the balance. To really put the care back into health care, what's needed is a deep, societal, structural change. If carers around the world felt better recognized, it would improve their own health."
"There are nearly 100 subtypes of HIV, with new subtypes being discovered regularly. HIV in the developed world is almost all of one subtype: subtype B. Some subtypes are more likely to become drug-resistant or progress to AIDS faster."
"HIV has a potential to transform itself into a new and different virus every time it infects a cell. The genetic difference between HIV subtypes from different patients may be as much as 35 percent. Despite the remarkable progress we've made in reversing the epidemic, the truth is that we are just a few viral mutations away from disaster."
"The motorized paraglider is the world's lightest and slowest aircraft. It consists of a backpack motor and a parachute-style wing. With 10 liters of fuel, it can fly for about two hours. It gives an unobstructed view, both horizontally and vertically, like a flying lawn chair."
"CNN's John Defterios traveled to the southern tip of Africa to document the effects of climate change on the region. He says he was shocked by the extent of the damage caused by the climate change. Defterius: ""It's like the world has been turned upside down. It's like we're in the middle of a desert."""
"This is Mount Visoke, with a small crater lake in its summit at 3,700 meters. The Dinka were still in love with their cattle, but they had turned in their spears for Kalashnikovs. In Namibia, the zebra have learned how to thrive in an environment that gets no rainfall."
"The Niger River valley is home to one of the oldest communities in the world. It was once the breadbasket for the Roman Empire, but was buried in sand by the time it was built. The people of the Niger River Valley have adapted to the changing climate."
"African climate continues to change, and you see it everywhere, like here in the Gorges de Ziz. The Dinka taught me how to tie papyrus into a shelter, and also how they had adapted their way of life around the migratory needs of their beloved cattle. With no money for rides, they often made the Mzungu ride on the roof of the trucks."
The Plastic Bank is the world's largest chain of stores for the ultra-poor. Everything in the store is available to be purchased using plastic garbage. Lise Nasis has the opportunity to earn a living by collecting material from door to door.
"We use social plastic to make shampoo, detergent and other products. We sort it, remove labels, we remove caps and get it ready for export. We sell it to suppliers of great brands like Marks and Spencer, who have commissioned the use of social plastic in their products."
"Plastic is a globally recognizable and tradable currency that, when used, alleviates poverty and cleans the environment. Humans have produced over eight trillion kilograms of plastic, most of it still here as waste. Worth roughly 50 cents a kilo, we're potentially unleashing a four-trillion-dollar value."
"You can now deposit your recyclables in Vancouver or Berlin. A family could withdraw building bricks or cell phone minutes in the slums of Manila. We're operating in Haiti and the Philippines. And this year, we're committing to India and Ethiopia."
"The Ocean Cleanup project, beach plastic recycling programs and any well-meaning ocean plastic company would still be too little, too late. But preventing ocean plastic could be humanity's richest opportunity. The world will say to you, ""What are you going to do?"""
"Do not be afraid to say, ""I know I can't do everything, but I can do something"" Become intimate with generosity. Find truth beyond the stories you are told. Investigate. Ask, ""Why?"" and ""Is this fair?"""
"""We are all more than our mistakes,"" she says. ""Learn to forgive others. Learn to forgive yourself. Ask, ""How did we get here?"" Start by picking up one piece of trash on your block. Recycle, reuse, reuse."
"Do not be afraid to be a part of the solutions. The more we talk about things, the more we see that the issues are connected because we are connected. When you help just one person to be more secure, a nation is more secure."
"With just one outstretched hand that says, ""Are you OK? I am here for you,"" we can transform insecurity into security. We ask the world to end suffering, but do I show up for those who are suffering on my street corner? We say to the world, ""Please change; we need change,"" but how do we show up to change our own lives?"
"Thelonious Monk: ""Our righteous acts create immeasurable ripples in the endless river of justice"" ""We spend so much time thinking we don't have the power to change the world,"" Monk says. ""We just have to be brave enough to care,"" he says."
"""Be good to as many people as possible"" is the advice of a young man to his son. ""I wanted him to know that each of us is more resilient than we could ever imagine,"" says the father. ""The world will say to you, ""Be a better person"" when he's old enough to read it,"" he adds."
"Fish social networks allow the actions of one to spread to many and could affect entire coral reefs. Overfishing, a common problem in coral reefs, could break up the social network of remaining fish. This would make coral reefs more vulnerable than we currently predict."
"Coral reefs depend on fish that perform a job by eating algae. If left unchecked, these algae can kill coral and take over entire coral reefs. ""I was just happy it wasn't a C- or a D. But the ""good as can be expected"" didn't seem right"""
"The Blue Man Group is touring the U.S. this month. The band is known for its off-Broadway shows. The group has also performed on Broadway and in Europe. ""I've come to believe that we need to cultivate safe and conducive conditions for new and innovative ideas to evolve and thrive,"" singer says."
"""All voices matter, all emotions matter,"" says the author. ""There is no out club. Everyone on your team is in"" says the writer. ""It's an aspirational practice that helps deal with difficult situations in a more respectful way"""

Sutter: ""Even when presented with the opportunity to ask for anything at all, most of us want the same things"" ""The humbling, unifying commonality of our humanity is that, even when we are different, we all want same things,"" Sutter says."
"The myths about the hymen have lived on for centuries because they have cultural significance. They have been used as a powerful tool in the effort to control women's sexuality. Women are still mistrusted, shamed, harmed and subjected to honor killings if they don't bleed on their wedding night."
"The ""hymen"" is a piece of tissue that covers the vaginal opening. It can be broken, but it is not the same thing as a ""hug"" or a ""tongue"" It is a part of the woman's body, and should not be destroyed."
